In addition, the species is shot by numerous parties of hunters coming from cities up to 200 km away to shoot deer by spotlighting at night.  The extent of occurrence of Tehuantepec jackrabbits is jeopardized by habitat alteration and degradation by introduction of exotic grasses, human-induced fires, agriculture, cattle-raising activities, and human settlements in savannas.  Predation was the major cause of mortality for radio-marked jackrabbits and accounted for 94% of juvenile deaths and 67% of adult deaths during a 29 month study.

    This is a high elevation species, collected at around 3,500 m, which - given lack of further collection records and nature of the habitat and topography in which it was originally found - is assumed to be restricted to a narrow geographic area. Climatic change is the most severe threat to restricted range, high elevation species which occupy a very specific climatic niche, particularly as several species have already been seen to have migrated several hundred metres uphill over the period since the description of this species (T.

Its habitat is highly fragmented due to conversion to agricultural practices such as eucalyptus plantations and cattle ranching. This species is flightless, not tolerant to pastureland and not attracted to cow dung and therefore it will not be able to adapt and survive in patches with agricultural influences, thus making it highly dependent on the few remaining forest fragments available.

In the 1970s dam construction in Popovo polje (Herzegovina) impacted water levels which supply the springs from near Metkovic to Dubrovnik. In recent years, the region around Metkovic is now a highly productive agricultural area, with the use of pesticides. In addition there is little sewage management, and so these waters pollute the groundwater. A further threat for the future of the systems is 3 dams being constructed upstream of Metkovic, which will have a major impact by taking water from the system, as well as increasing the rate of inflow from the sea, causing increased salinity, and hence mortality of the species. The conditions of the Ombla spring will be altered due to the construction of a dam that is in plan. The area around Dubrovnik and Cavtat is under stress during the tourist season, being affected by water extraction and pollution.

    Lake Biwa is under threat from eutrophication as a result of the surrounding towns, cities and farmland increasing the nutrient loads through sewage and run-off entering the lake (Lake Biwa Museum 2009). The urbanisation of the shoreline and conversion of inflowing streams and rivers to concrete irrigation ditches has contributed to the additional sedimentation and pollution the lake recieves (Lake Biwa Museum 2009). Habitat loss, such as the conversion of adjacent lakes to paddy fields and reed bed reduction by over 50%, has compounded the ability of the lake to remove excess nutrients and added a new source of turbid water (Ramsar 2008, Lake Biwa Museum 2009). There are additional environmental imapcts resulting from recreational activites, such as rubbish and discarded fishhooks (Ramsar 2008). The Biwa-ko Total Development Project which is designed to control and utilise the lake's water has modified the landscape of the lake and changed the water levels (Ramsar 2008).

    This species is threatened by non-targeted hunting (Bleisch 1991) and habitat loss due to forest clearing (Bleisch 1995). It is also sometimes caught in snares set for other animals (Bleisch 1995). Previously, collection of magnolia flower buds and bark (by cutting down tress) by local villagers removed a food source of this species, but this practice has reportedly ceased (Dunyan pers. comm. 2006). There is currently construction and development for tourism, including a tourist road, cable car and hotels within the nature reserve, which are a potential threat because of habitat destruction and disturbance.

    Invasive Yellow Crazy Ants are the major threat to this species, particularly on Savai'i (R. Fisher pers. comm. 2012). Although this invasive species has been known from the island for 150 years, an irruption was first detected in the west of Savai'i in 2012 (R. Fisher pers. comm. 2013). Due to a shortage of surveys it is not clear when this irruption began. On this island, the lizard appears to have disappeared from areas below 500 m in areas where ants have irrupted, and can no longer be found in apparently optimal habitat (R. Fisher pers. comm. 2012). No information is available on the status or distribution of invasive ants in eastern Savai'i, or any effects on lizard subpopulations (R. Fisher pers. comm. 2013).

Logging and road openings for highway construction have negatively affected these forests (McGinley 2007). In the specific localities where the species is found the major threat is the mining activity, however, it remains uncertain how much the environment is damaged.

    This species is threatened as a result of habitat loss due to expanding human populations. Shifting cultivation has become more intense and less sustainable in some parts of Hainan. In other areas there is intensive agriculture, including plantations of rubber, coffee and palm oil. Deforestation also results from timber extraction. The area of natural forest on Hainan decreased from 16,920 km² in 1943 to 3,000 km² in 1994 (Birdlife International 2008). Dam projects have also caused inundation of habitat in areas where this species has been recorded.

Many small nature reserves have been designated in the interior portions of Hainan Island, but these tend to be degraded and lack connectivity with other nature reserves (Carpenter 2001). Extension of existing areas and restoring connectivity is likely to benefit this species.

    Threatened by illegal hunting, destruction of montane forest and heathlands, encroachment by cattle, expansion of high-altitude cultivation, roads, and harassment by dogs. Permanent occupation of suitable habitat as a result of increasing human and livestock populations is exerting tremendous pressure on nyala habitat throughout the range, with anecdotal evidence suggesting mountain nyalas actively avoid livestock (Sillero-Zubiri in press). Mountain Nyalas are extensively hunted for meat and horns, the latter used for local medicine and to make nipples for traditional milk bottles. Trophy hunting blocks in Arsi have been hunted out and concessions moved to Bale, with continued pressure by the industry for additional hunting blocks and larger quotas. Effects of current trophy-hunting programs are not well understood and current trophy hunting quotas may be unsustainable in the long-term (Sillero-Zubiri in press).

Sustainable trophy hunting in some of these areas has very high potential for generating the revenue needed to fund effective conservation of this species and the other endemics which share its habitat.

    The major threats to this species are a decline in the quality of its habitat due to the invasion of alien species and intrinsic factors, such as its restricted distribution and poor recruitment. Reproductive success seems to be disturbed; seedlings can be observed in  the wild but saplings are very rarely seen (J.  Mougal pers. comm. 2006). The species was described as a good firewood and charcoal (Carlström 1996) and  it is likely that it was cut down during the time of cinnamon distilleries.

    Habitat conversion poses the most serious threat to the Houston toad. Several populations were eliminated with the expansion of Houston, and the largest remaining population in Bastrop County is also under intense and immediate threat from urbanization and recreational over-development. Many Houston toads are killed each year by automobiles. Roadway mortality will increase as human populations continue to increase within the species’ habitat and as the habitat continues to be dissected by more roads. Road construction further isolates populations and disrupts or prevents the movement of individual toads between populations. This movement of toads is necessary to maintain gene flow, and thus genetic diversity, and to supplement small or declining local populations. It is possible to build roads with underpasses or other structures that allow toads and other wildlife to pass safely beneath the roads. While converting woodlands to pastures or ploughed fields destroys Houston toad habitat and favours the proliferation of other toad species, certain agricultural practices can be beneficial to Houston toads. These include maintaining low to moderate numbers of livestock to avoid overgrazing, protecting pond habitat from livestock and predatory fish, planting native bunchgrasses instead of sod-forming grasses such as Bermuda grass (which are difficult for the toads to move through), and conserving large blocks of woodlands. Certain forestry practices may benefit the Houston toad, while others, such as clear cutting, are harmful. Thinning and burning have been shown to benefit some species of amphibians and reptiles by opening up the forest canopy and allowing more sunlight to reach the forest floor. This practice encourages the growth of vegetation and, in turn, increases insect numbers. This may be beneficial to the Houston toad. Other threats that often appear in conjunction with the factors outlined above include prolonged drought and the presence of fire ants, an unwelcome species from Brazil. Fire ants have been observed preying on toadlets as they leave their breeding pond. Fire ants thrive in open, sunny areas where the soil has been disturbed and woody vegetation uprooted, as in agricultural fields and urban areas. Protecting large forested areas is one of the most effective deterrents to fire ants. Where fire ant control with pesticides is necessary, mounds should be treated individually, rather than broadcasting the chemicals, to avoid impacting other invertebrates that the Houston toad eats (see http://ifw2es.fws.gov/HoustonToad).

    
  ","['\n    The Houston toad was the first amphibian granted protection under the U.S. Endangered Species Act. A critical habitat was designated in 1978 in Bastrop and Burleson counties, in areas supporting the largest populations known at that time. However, the population within critical habitat in Burleson County has not been seen since 1983. In the 1970s, the state of Texas acquired land within designated critical habitat in Bastrop County adjacent to Buescher and Bastrop state parks to aid in conservation. Additionally, an effort was started in 1978 by the Houston Zoo to identify remaining Houston toad populations and supplement them or establish new populations in protected areas using wild-caught adults, naturally deposited eggs, or captive-reared juveniles and adults. However, new populations were not established in spite of introducing over 500,000 individuals (adults, juveniles, larvae) into sites at the Attwater Prairie Chicken National Wildlife Refuge. Research is urgently needed to determine the status of Houston toad populations outside Bastrop County and promote conservation efforts in these areas. Research is also critical to determine which management practices are most conducive to the Houston toad and the ecosystem on which it depends. The Houston Toad Recovery Plan was published by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) in 1984. The Texas Parks and Wildlife Department and the USFWS have jointly prepared a brochure for private landowners who wish to implement their agricultural practices in ways that are compatible with the needs of the Houston toad and the Texas Forest Service has formed a committee to develop management practices that protect the Houston toad and its habitat. Additionally, the USFWS is working with community leaders, private landowners, and conservation organizations to develop and implement a regional Habitat Conservation Plan for Bastrop County, which would provide for the issuance of endangered species permits that allow development to proceed while ensuring permanent habitat protection. The USFWS also has established a fund with the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation to assist in local habitat protection efforts for the Houston toad.\n\n    \n  ']",Decreasing,"

    Leading hypotheses for the declines are disease (chytridiomycosis), airborne contaminants, and livestock grazing. An examination of preserved specimens from a 1970 die-off found multiple pathogens, but no single pathogen was present in more than 25% of the specimens, suggesting that the animals suffered from suppressed immune systems (Green and Kagarise Sherman 2001). Davidson, Shaffer and Jennings (2002) found a weak pattern between declines at sites and amount of agricultural land upwind (suggesting that windborne agrochemicals may have contributed to declines). Livestock grazing may have detrimental impacts on Yosemite Toads through trampling, alteration of meadow habitat, and possible lowered water quality (D. Martin pers. comm.). Other factors that may have contributed to declines are the 1980s California drought, and predation by introduced trout. Ultraviolet radiation is not suspected to be a major contributor to declines based on fieldwork by Sadinski (pers. comm.).

    
  ","['\n    Most of the habitat of this species is confined within protected areas including: Yosemite National Park, Kings Canyon National Park, wilderness areas of Eldorado, Inyo, Stanislaus, and Sierra National Forest, with the highest number of populations recorded in Sierra National Forest followed by Stanislaus National Forest. Off-highway vehicle use, pack stock and cattle grazing still occur in National Forests, as well as protected wilderness areas; only pack stock use continues in Yosemite National Park and Kings Canyon National Park. Because declines have occurred in pristine areas in parks, no occurrences can be regarded as adequately protected. This species has been federally petitioned for listing under the Endangered Species Act in March 2000 by the Pacific Rivers Council and Centre for Biological Diversity. In December 2002 the US Fish and Wildlife Service published a decision in the Federal Register that placed the toad on the ""warranted-but-precluded"" list due to higher priority listings. Further taxonomic work is required to determine the status of this species relative to ', <em>B. exsul</em>, '.\n\n    \n  ']",Decreasing,"

    The species in found in the Madagascar dry deciduous forests, which is a habitat type that has been severely destroyed, it is in fact estimated that the western dry forest has reduced by approximately 40% since the 1970s (Moat and Smith 2007) and that since human settlement of this region, an estimated 97 per cent of the island’s dry deciduous western forests have been destroyed, and those remaining are extremely localized and isolated (Crowley 2001). The major threat to the dry, deciduous forests is destruction and fragmentation through intentional burning to clear land for grazing and agricultural lands, and through wildfires sparked by burning adjacent secondary grasslands. With an expanding rural population and increasing degradation of existing arable lands, the pressure on the remaining forest is extremely high. Selective logging and the removal of large trees pose additional threats of forest habitat degradation. As the distance between the subpopulations is very large (ca. 800 km) it is unlikely that genetic material is being exchanged. This could lead to a possible erosion of genetic variability by bottlenecks, genetic drift or inbreeding, meaning that as a result of the loss of genetic diversity, the populations might became more susceptible to ecological or anthropogenic perturbation.

    The main threats to this species are habitat loss as a result of agriculture and the intense use of natural resources in the area (The Nature Conservancy 2010). Opencast iron mining also occurs on a huge scale (Burman 1991). Around 7% of the Caatinga vegetation in Brazil is in protected areas, but only just over 1% of this protected habitat has full protection with restricted human use. The savanna habitats which are endemic to Brazil are currently not given enough attention, compared with the rainforests (Burman 1991).

Ninety-seven percent of frog sites are located on unprotected land, most of which is in state forest or timber reserve. There are several activities likely to occur on these lands, which may impact on the amount and quality of the frog’s habitat, including grazing, logging, road works, clearing and development. Habitat in the south-east of Timber Reserve 245 and Tumoulin State Forest has been severely affected by cattle grazing. Grazing and trampling has the potential to degrade and destroy the seepage areas used by the frogs for breeding. Similarly, erosion and subsequent siltation may cover seepage areas if future logging or clearing occurs. Roads and cuttings can alter the water quality and hydrology and may affect seepage areas and first order streams. Regrowth forest uses more water than old growth and therefore has the potential to reduce seepages. The population at the Ravenshoe rubbish dump has declined. Dump activities have destroyed or modified habitat, and previously known populations are now absent.

    The areas where this species has been recorded are subject to agricultural development and forest reduction. The high recorded altitudes for this species may afford it some protection. However, felling for timber may possibly pose threats to this epiphytic orchid. It is also possible that it may be subject to collection from the wild as it is grown by orchid enthusiasts and such collection has been known to occur with other orchid species in Peru (Tasker 2009).

    
  ","['\n    The specimen collections that were found were not made from within protected areas. It is recommended that new areas for protection are identified and existing areas extended. This species is, however, listed in appendix II of CITES, intended to give protection from trade incompatible with species survival in the wild. Further research is needed into the ecology and habitat requirements of, and specific threats to, this orchid to determine its conservation needs. Surveys are needed to establish the current population status and confirm the geographic distribution. Subsequent monitoring to detect any decline is also recommended. Although cultivated by orchid enthusiasts it is not known to be held within a botanic garden and\xa0 it is recommended that, if possible, seeds are also stored as part of ', <em>ex situ </em>, 'conservation measures. It is also recommended that further taxonomic studies are undertaken as Luer (1982) notes that this species is closely allied to many others in its section (Coriacea).\n\n    \n  ']",Unknown,"

    Due to its ornamental value the species is heavily collected in the wild for commercial use. The principal threat in the Cordillera de los Huacamayos is deforestation due to colonization (Manzanares and Pitman 2003). General threats to the Eastern Cordillera Real Montane Forests ecoregion, where this species is found, include conversion of native forest to coffee plantations and other agriculture and pasture for goats and cattle. Mining operations, especially strip mining, degrade the habitat, and logging has encroached from the southern lowland forests up into the premontane areas. Urban sprawl and road construction are additional threats to the vegetation.

    Shifting cultivation, and associated burning, has affected some forest areas. There is also settled agriculture including an ongoing project to increase cocoa production in Buru, Central Maluku, and West Seram - as of 2009, Maluku had 11,835 ha of cocoa plantation (AgroAsia 2011). Commercial logging on Buru intensified during the 1970s (Wikramanayake 2002) and the Trans-Seram Highway also threatens forest habitat. There has been illegal logging, land clearance, and soil erosion. Nearly 1/5 of the Seram rainforest ecoregions native forests has been cleared, with logging continuing to pose a serious threat (Morrison 2001). This is a species of steep slopes, in pockets of humus, and moderate forest shade, making it prone to disturbance from forest clearance and soil erosion. It also has the potential threat of illegal collection, as this is an attractive orchid species.

    
  ","['\n    This orchid is listed in the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species Appendix I as it is considered that trade may threaten this species with extinction (CITES 2009). The conservation status of the Seram and Buru rainforest ecoregion is considered relatively stable (Morrison 2001 a,b). Protected areas only cover 16-17% of the land area but extensive forest cover remains. The records for this species do not fall within any protected area. The remoteness of these islands to some extent assists in reducing human induced disturbance. This species is cultivated, propagated from specimens originally brought back to Europe in the 1800s (Peterson 1985), and it has also been hybridized. It is in ', <em>ex situ</em>, ' collections such as the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew. It was not found in available lists of seed bank species.\n\n    \n  ']",Unknown,"

The establishment of several large projects (such as the Transamazonian highway BR-230), which bisects the interfluvium from east to west, the Carajás Mineral Complex and the Tucuruí hydroelectric dam, have lead to considerable habitat loss. In the north of the range, the habitat is under pressure from both small-holder and large-scale farming activities and cattle ranching.

    Wood cutting is the main threat.  The wood of Cupressaceous conifers, as well as its foliage, is sought after in eastern Asian culture.  The lower slopes are being heavily deforested for the expansion of agriculture, but this is unlikely to reach the ridges.  But firewood cutting and cutting for other purposes (this species produces a fine, yellow-brown very hard, fragrant timber) evidently does occur in some areas.  Due to the lack of transport facilities and other factors, most of the timber has been traded locally.  Estimates of population decline cannot be made at this stage given our current knowledge.

    Threats to the native, endemic flora of the high altitude plateaus of Maharashtra include grazing, soil erosion, agricultural development, mining for iron and aluminium ores, tourism, dams and private land development. These pressures are likely to continue as long as the plateaus, that appear as barren and bald during most of the seasons (except monsoon), are perceived as wastelands by planners and developers (Jagdale and Kanwar 2004). The ability of this species to persist and regenerate in disturbed and secondary vegetation is unknown. The tubers yield a white edible starch, which has sometimes been used as a substitute for arrowroot starch. Hence, it is widely cultivated in some parts of Goa, Diu, Daman, Dadra and Nagar Haveli. Products containing this species are sold internationally and it is used in Indian folk medicine (Nadkarni and Nadkarmi 1994). The impact on the population, as a result of the harvest of wild tubers for the manufacture of arrowroot, is unknown. It is a very attractive species which has ornamental potential (Peter 2007). Gingers have enjoyed popularity as an ornamental plant in Asia and the Far East for centuries. Ornamental gingers have rapidly increased in popularity in the past few years in the western world (West Demmy and Burch 1998, Peter 2007), which has promoted an increase in illegal collecting.

    The primary threat is habitat loss, as described for the locality in Canton Limon-Indanza where this species was once found in forest remnants between pastures and where the area is used for subsistence farming. During the 2015 field work, it was found that deforestation is continuing in the region of the type locality, with a new paved highway nearly completed as far south as Zumba. In the previous assessment (Skinner 2014) it was suspected that the species might be present in the protected area of the Podocarpus National Park and in a sparsely settled area of mountainous terrain between Valladolid and Zamora, but this now seems less likely as we (D. Skinner, M. Jiménez Villalta and M. Jiménez León) did not find it in the northern part of the park or in the Alto Numbami area which has good forest at similar elevations. The only protected area where we (D. Skinner, M. Jiménez Villalta and M. Jiménez León) saw plants presumed to be this species is the Reserva Maycu which is across the Rio Nangaritza in the Cordillera del Cóndor. As noted earlier, the plants found here are of a different form from the ones at the type locality.

    The forests of Bioko and west Cameroon over 1,000 m alt. are currently under only minimal anthropogenic pressure. However, the low number of locations, and their apparent isolation, render this species vulnerable to stochastic events such as localised landslide or overgrazing by native mammals. Onana and Cheek (2011) stated that it was possible that following the exhaustion of lowland forest resources, there would be increased human encroachment into the montane forests in future unless protected by law. This has in fact happened recently at the lower elevation site in the Bakossi Mts where part of the forest in this area has been cleared to make way for the construction of a reservoir. Such development is likely to lead to further clearance of the forest for agriculture, etc.

    Water quality degradation due to industrial, mining, agricultural, and urban pollution are probably the primary reasons for the extirpation of this species over much of its historic range in the upper Black Warrior River system. The remaining Black Warrior waterdog populations are isolated from each other by unsuitable habitat created by impoundments, pollution, or other factors. The fragmentation of habitat renders populations vulnerable to catastrophic events such as flood, drought, or chemical spills. In addition, if stream quality improves within areas of the basin, impoundments and polluted reaches will act as barriers to the re-establishment of waterdog populations. Direct take for commercial, recreational, scientific, or educational purposes are not currently considered to be a threat. Disease and predation are not known to be factors in the decline.

    Several populations have doubtless been eliminated by habitat alterations (Etnier and Starnes 1993). Spring habitats are rapidly being altered through use of chemicals to eliminate native plants and animals so that the springs can be used for ""home water gardens,"" fishing ponds (with introduced fishes), and drinking water sources (Boschung and Mayden 2004). Stream habitats have been degraded by groundwater depletion (loss of spring influence) and massive siltation and pollution associated with urbanization (e.g., Birmingham, Alabama) (Boschung and Mayden 2004). Large concrete structures pose a barrier to dispersal (B. R. Kuhajda pers. comm. 1998), as do impoundments. Warm summer-month temperatures in surrounding spring waters are also thought to preclude dispersal (B. R. Kuhajda pers. comm. 1998).

Surveys between 2000 and 2007 in Lake Er Hai showed there to be few, if any, gastropods remaining in the lake. The gastropod fishery has closed within the last ten years, the likely cause of this is use of chemicals to control algal nuisance.

The animals are also being affected by disease, probably spread by invasive species, and as a result of poor water quality.

Below this point, the stream joins with the Nam Phao which is totally filled with sediments resulting from the construction of a small hydropower reservoir.

The river is filled with sediment almost until its confluence with the Nam Theun. In addition the lower Nam Phao receives wastes from Laksao and pollution from a gold mine on one of its tributaries.

Additional threats include fires set to increase livestock pasture, the cutting of trees to produce charcoal, forest destruction caused by itinerant miners, and hunting. During the dry season, they drink water on the ground, and when they move between forest patches they move along the ground where their conspicuous colouration makes them vulnerable to predators and hunters.

The total population could be as few as 500, and the effective breeding population only 125 individuals. The only protected area in which it is known to occur is the Analamerana Special Reserve. A small number may still be found as well in the eastern section of Ankarana National Park, which is connected through a series of forest patches to populations at Andriafiamena and Analamerana. It has recently been seen in unprotected forest patches between Analamerana and Ankarana, and is present in the Andavakoera Classified Forest, but probably in very low numbers. There is an urgent need for a full-time, long-term scientific presence in the Analamerana Special Reserve, as well as an expansion of this protected area to include the forests of Andriafiamena and a connection to Ankarana. This effort should also include an education campaign in the region, as well as surveys in nearby forest patches to look for any other populations.

The major threats for the few surviving populations are pollution or any kind of mechanical alteration/disturbance (impoundment, canalisation, dredging, etc.) to the waterbodies in which they still persist. Further rarefaction of their fish host or hosts or any type of activity causing barrier-effects for the fish hosts also constitute a major threat, as it relies on a host fish, probably trout, which is also threatened because of pollution.

    The cause of population decline is mainly attributable to the excessive demand for rhino horn and other products for Chinese and allied medicine systems (Foose and van Strien 1997). The bulk of the remaining population occurs as a single population within a national park and the population size in Ujung Kulon National Park is probably limited to the effective carrying capacity of the area (around 50 animals). One possible threat to this population is disease. In addition, such a small population faces a constant threat from poachers, although there is evidence that current poaching levels are under control (Sectionov and Waladi pers. comm.).

    Immediate threats to this species include wildfire, inappropriate hazard reduction burns and associated fire management activities. The majority of the current known populations is reproductively immature and fire has the potential to destroy reproductively immature plants and thus lead to localized extinctions (NSW National Parks and Wildlife Service 2000). Fire intervals of less than 10–15 years are likely to result in subpopulation declines, and fire intervals of less than three to four years are likely to result in its extinction (Department of the Environment, Water, Heritage and the Arts 2008). In the New South Wales east coast, 1.46 million hectares of both forest and non-forest landscapes were burnt in 2002-2003 (Montreal Process Implementation Group for Australia 2008); in the Goulburn River National Park the biggest wildfire in 1997-1998 burnt ~24,000 hectares, further prescribed burns were carried out every year since 2000 but the majority of the park has not been burnt since records began (NSW National Parks and Wildlife Service 2004); in Wollemi National Park the largest wildfire in 2001-2002 burnt over ~200,000 hectares and over half of the park was burnt in the last 10 years, large areas of the park are in a moderate level of risk category due to frequent fires leading to populations of threatened species possibly being under threat of depletion if current regimes are continued (NSW National Parks and Wildlife Service 2006). This plant is believed to be palatable, hence grazing may pose an additional threat. Juvenile plants in some populations were heavily cropped, presumably by native animals (NSW National Parks and Wildlife Service 2000).

    
  ","['\n    It is known to occur within two protected areas in New South Wales, in the Goulburn River and Wollemi National Park.

Also listed as 2VCa according to Briggs and Leigh (1995), a Vulnerable species with the geographic range less than 100 km', <sup>2</sup>, "", with more than 1,000 plants known to occur within the reserved area. The distribution of this species overlaps with the “White Box-Yellow Box-Blakely's Red Gum Grassy Woodland and Derived Native Grassland” Critically Endangered EPBC Act-listed ecological community of which less than 0.1% remains in a near-intact condition. Much of the original habitat was cleared for agriculture, in the areas that remain, grazing has removed the native understorey (Department of the Environment, Water, Heritage and the Arts 2006). Recommendations to reduce threat by fire include: trail maintenance, bush fire suppression, mop up operations and mechanical fuel reduction should be avoided in known species locations (NSW National Parks and Wildlife Service 2006). It is recommended that further research is carried out on the response of this species to fire, habitat status, population size and levels of threats. Also to support the recovery of this species is it recommended identification of populations of high conservation priority, raise awareness, management of the threats and establishment of additional populations (Department of the Environment, Water, Heritage and the Arts 2008).

    It is unknown what threats impacted on this species in the past. It has been postulated that an extended drought in the early 1930s which is known to have drastically lowered the water levels in the already shallow Utah Lake, combined with harsh winters that caused the lake to freeze to the bottom, would probably have killed all but the hardiest of organisms living there. The early 1930s is also the time at which endemic fish and snail species became extinct in Lake Utah (K. Perez pers. comm. 2011). Low water levels would also have greatly increased the alkalinity of the lake which may have also contributed to the decline of this species (Oliver and Bosworth III 1999). The single site remains in poor condition (J. Cordeiro pers. comm. 2012). However, further targeted surveys, appropriate to this species, need to be carried out in order to provide more evidence that this species may be extinct.

    Hunting for the purposes of traditional ""medicine"" is the primary threat facing this species; most of the populations that survive are heavily reduced and fragmented. Only the subpopulation at Van Long, with about 50 individuals, is thought likely to survive given the current hunting pressure; however, quarrying for limestone (cement), which is currently taking place there, has affected the ranging behaviour of the animals (T. Nadler pers. comm.). The smallest groups are extremely unlikely to survive should the one reproductively active male be taken or killed (Nadler 2004). Forest loss is a more minor threat as it occurs in degraded areas. A potential threat is the rapid development of tourist facilities adjacent to protected areas, especially around Van Long and Hoa Lu Nature Reserves.

    
  ","[""\n    This species is currently listed only as CITES Appendix II. It is considered 'endangered' in Viet Nam, and is listed as a 'most endangered' species under Annex 1B of Decree 32 (2006). It occurs in six protected areas, but many still experience high hunting pressure. Van Long Nature Reserve was established for this species in 2001, and there has been some evidence of population growth in this reserve in the past five years. The connection of forest fragments in some already protected areas, such as Van Long, could greatly increase the size and survivability of some subpopulations. Also considered as beneficial population management for this species are the translocation of severely threatened (small) groups to safe and suitable habitat, and the augmentation of existing groups with offspring from a captive population. Delacour's langurs have been successfully kept and bred in captivity at the Endangered Primate Rescue Center in Cuc Phuong National Park, Viet Nam, which is currently the only collection keeping this species (Nadler 2004). It is necessary to ensure the sustainability of these programs.

    Historical exploitation for its valuable timber during the 19th centry led to a reduction of up to 95%. One consequence of this was the expansion of fynbos, a highly flammable vegetation formation. More frequent and more intense fires prevent regeneration; surviving trees are restricted to rocky ridges, ledges, and outcrops mostly beyond reach of the flames. Natural regeneration is also hampered as a result of granivory and herbivory by native rodents.

    
  ","['\n    Today the few remaining trees are protected from cutting for any purposes.

    Habitat loss and poor water quality issues from point and non-point source pollution have plagued aquatic organisms within these streams for many decades   (R. Thoma, T. Jones and J. Cordeiro pers. comm. 2009). While efforts are currently underway to improve water quality in a few streams, much of the watershed continues to suffer from historical surface coal mining practices   (R. Thoma, T. Jones and J. Cordeiro pers. comm. 2009). Although much of the East Fork Obey River system remains forested, increasing residential development, logging, and agricultural practices pose continuing threats. Note there is the potential (not realized) threat of a large sand mine being considered for construction in the heart of the range of this species (R. Thoma to C. Taylor pers. comm. 2008).

    This species is threatened mainly by hunting and commercial logging (Whittaker 2006), as well as by conversion to oil palm plantations and forest clearing and product extraction by local people (Whittaker 2006). Only 10-15% of the original forest cover remains on Sipora (Fuentes 1996/1997). Recently, hunting pressure has increased because of improved access to remote areas due to logging roads and tracks, as well as the replacement of bows and arrows with .177 caliber air rifles (anything larger is illegal in Indonesia) (Whittaker 2006). Also, local rituals and taboos that formerly regulated hunting have been replaced by Christianity (Whittaker 2006). The pet trade is also a threat to this species (Whittaker 2006).

    The relatively low human density and footprint, the lack of transport routes and an abrupt topography have allowed parts of the region where this species was thought to be collected, to remain intact. Other parts have greatly suffered from habitat loss and general degradation due to human activities. Both the Yungas and dry montane forests, in the department of La Paz, are considered to be in a critical conservation state. Current threats to plant species in the region include slash and burn and logging for cultivation of cash crops (subsistence agriculture, cocoa, coffee and  Coca), inappropriate and harmful agricultural techniques, road construction (e.g., construction of the Cotapata-Santa Barbara highway which is having a huge ecological impact), wildfires, gold mining, population extinctions due to reduced size and isolation, human colonization, timber exploitation, tourism, dam construction, landslides, waste disposal and pollution. Climate change may affect the distribution and composition of montane plants communities. It is not known how these threats would directly affect the population this taxon as its biology and ecology  have not been studied.

    
  ","['\n    Bolivia is the poorest country of South America and poverty and development lead to biodiversity degradation and loss. Although conservation efforts have evolved rapidly, they are hindered by accelerating economic development and a high level of social conflicts (Ibisch 2005). Although the department of La Paz is an important centre of plant diversity and endemism and harbours many rare and threatened species, there is only one protected area within the potential range of this species, in the Yungas, and none in the dry montane forest (López and Zambrana-Torrelio 2006). The Cotapata National Park was created in 1993 to mitigate the ecological impact of the Cotapata-Santa Barbara highway. An inventory of the flora of the park is in progress but has not yet been completed, with about two thirds of the species not yet investigated. ParksWatch considers the Cotapata PN-ANMI as vulnerable because it is too small and isolated and recommend to extend the surface of the park so that it is biologically viable (de Boissieu 2005). Field surveys need to be conducted in potentially suitable areas (i.e., around 2,750 m altitudinal zone, in the department of La Paz) to confirm whether this species still occurs and, if so, to estimate its range and population size. The biology, ecology and dynamics of the population should be studied as well as its resilience to anthropogenic disturbances. Raising awareness among local communities on the value of these ecosystems and management of tourism are essential.\n\n    \n  ']",Unknown,"

The area around Tovar, where the taxon was collected over 150 years ago, has dramatically changed since then, being very close to the capital of the country, Caracas, however reasonable size forest patches still remain. The selective extraction of some plants of commercial value is threatening several orchid and tree fern species in this region.

    This species was collected in low numbers but with some apparent regularity prior to the introduction of Small Indian Mongoose to St. Croix in the late 19th Century, and predation by this invasive mammal ""undoubtedly explains"" the absence of records from St. Croix since 1883 despite intensive survey work in the Virgin Islands during the 20th Century (Hedges and Conn 2012). Green Cay, where the species might survive, is a wildlife refuge, however, Black Rats occur on this island and may represent a threat to any surviving population (Hedges and Conn 2012) given the very small size of the cay, which may not be able to sustain a substantial population of these large skinks. Surveys on Green Cay over the past decade have not recorded this species (Hedges and Conn 2012). Hedges and Conn (2012) hypothesize that habitat destruction resulting from agricultural and urban expansion may threaten any surviving population on St. Croix, however, the available evidence that the species is extinct on St. Croix suggests that these processes cannot be considered major threats.

    Mongoose predation has been implicated as the cause of this lizard's disappearance from St. Thomas and probably also from St. John, two of the largest US Virgin Islands (Hedges and Conn 2012, Platenberg and Bouton 2006). Mongoose are widespread in the British Virgin Islands, making this invasive species a cause of particular concern (Perry and Gerber 2006). Most recent records of this species are from mongoose-free islands, although there are recent records from Tortola where mongoose are found (Hedges and Conn 2012). Introduction of mongoose, either deliberately or by storm transport, to these remaining islands is a ""significant probability"" (S.B. Hedges pers. comm. 2013). Agricultural and urban development in the British Virgin Islands is likely to further reduce available habitat for a species already excluded from much of its historical range by exotic species, and it may be susceptible to predation by other exotic mammals such as black rats (Hedges and Conn 2012).

A forest fragment outside the reserve where this species was recorded is entirely surrounded by cleared land  (C. Vásquez Almazán pers. comm. March 2011). The edges of the reserve itself are under increasing pressure from human encroachment from both the resident population and new communities migrating into the area. The extraction of timber from forest at the reserve edge is widespread, and in some areas so intensive that the forest is completely cleared and subsequently converted to agriculture (C.

Competition from mammalian herbivores probably also occurs.  Hunting of Ricord’s iguanas for food and trade has increased gradually since the mid 1970s, both for local consumption as well as at a few oriental restaurants in Santo Domingo where iguanas were offered as a speciality dish.  In the past, some hunters used to set up to 100 snare traps per day at the entrance of retreats, with 30-50% trapping success.

The development of the cattle industry, compounded by rinderpest and drought are continuing threats.

Recommendations for the long-term conservation of the Hirola in Kenya have been included in a conservation action plan (Magin 1996) and a conservation evaluation report (Butynski 1999). These recommendations are now part of the current conservation and management plan for the Hirola in Kenya (Hirola Management Committee 2004) and are being acted upon by the Kenya Wildlife Service, in conjunction with the Hirola Management Committee and local conservation NGOs. There is an urgent need to improve the level of management and protection of the one natural population of Hirola, particularly in the Arawale National Reserve and in the Galma Galla/Kolbio region of Kenya. Community conservation and anti-poaching activities must be established over a large portion of the remaining range, but insecurity for conservation workers is an extremely serious problem in this region. Consideration should be given to establishing protected areas at Galma Galla and Lag Dere, and to expanding the Tana Primate National Reserve to the east to include at least 300 km² of prime habitat for Hirola (Butynski in press).

    The two principal threats are poaching and reduced population viability. Hunting is primarily driven by the demand for the supposedly medicinal properties of rhino horns and other body parts, and many centuries of over-hunting has reduced this species to a tiny percentage of its former population and range. The species is now so reduced that there are very small numbers in each locality where it still survives. As a result, breeding activity is infrequent, successful births are uncommon in many populations, and there is a severe risk of inbreeding depression (J. Payne pers. comm.). The species is frequently stated to be sensitive to habitat disturbance (van Strien, 1986), but timber extraction is of little or no significance to the species, as it is robust enough to withstand more or less any forest condition (J. Payne pers. comm.).

    
  ","['\n    The species has been included on CITES Appendix I since 1975, and legally protected in all range states.  An extensive international co-operative programme for the conservation of this species is being implemented with ', <em>in situ</em>, ' activities being conducted in Indonesia and Malaysia. The primary objectives are to develop and deploy effective anti-poaching teams and to provide the co-ordination capacity to manage and sustain the programme. Rhino Protection Units (RPU) have been a ', <em>force majeur</em>, ' in stopping poaching in Sumatra.

    This species appears to have an extremely limited distribution, despite extensive searches (Horwitz 1990). Virtually nothing is known of the ecology, population dynamics and habitat requirements of the species. It is thought indigenous vegetation removal, cattle trampling of both the ground and creek banks and alteration of the water table may adversely affect this species (Morey 2004). Most of the creek frontage at the known locations is unfenced and where cattle have had unrestricted access to creeks in the catchment, the understorey is virtually absent. Cattle has been grazed in the area for the past 100 years (B. Whiting pers. comm. to J. Morey undated). Cattle may have affected this species by compacting the ground and possibly collapsing burrows as well as causing streamside erosion, bank damage and loss of native vegetation. Gold-mining was apparently conducted along the creek and its tributaries earlier this century. Rock is still mined within the catchment. It is not known how critical the persistence of native vegetation is to the survival of the species (Morey 2004). The only known current locations of the species are on Labertouche Creek and Wattle Creek (a tributary of Labertouche Creek) in West Gippsland (Morey 2004). This means that if the Labertouche Creek were to become polluted the Wattle Creek population may also be affected.

    
  ","['\n    This species has been listed as a threatened taxon in Schedule 2 of the Flora and Fauna Guarantee Act 1988. In its final recommendation, the Scientific Advisory Committee (SAC 1993) determined that this species is significantly prone to future threats which are likely to result in extinction (Morey 2004). A community education and awareness component was implemented by NRE in 1995. An information brochure on this species was distributed to all landholders within the Labertouche Creek catchment, and meetings were also held with landholders and the local Labertouche Landcare group. Some of the known habitat was fenced to help restrict access for cattle to the creek (Morey 2004).', <br/>, <br/>, 'Future management will include: coordinating research and surveys at other locations within the Labertouche Creek catchment and adjacent catchments to estimate the population size, determine its ecological requirements, investigate its reproductive biology, and determine the ecological relationships with other sympatric decapods; set aside the Crown Land on Labertouche Creek containing remnant vegetation that has been recommended for reservation by the LCC as a Flora and Fauna Reserve; determine appropriate buffer width of riparian vegetation required to protect the species, and encourage land managers and landholders to fence off direct access to creeks for cattle; re-establish indigenous riparian vegetation (Morey 2004).\n\n    \n  ']",Unknown,"

    This species is sensitive to changing water quality and physical disruption. It is therefore threatened by habitat alteration and pollution from strip mine runoff and coal washing. Intensive industrial and agricultural development of the Tennessee Valley since the early 1900s has had a significant impact upon the mussel fauna inhabiting the Tennessee River basin.  Dam construction in the upper Tennessee River system may have been the most significant factor.  Dams were constructed for hydroelectric power, flood control, and navigation, as well as recreation.  Siltation has also impacted the species (from strip mining, coal mining, road construction, forestry and agricultural operations).  Pollution is also a factor, from heavy metals, industrial effluent, chemical spills, agricultural waste, fertilizers, pesticides, and human waste (USFWS 1984).  Populations in the North Fork of Holston and Clinch rivers were reduced by toxic discharges and spills prior to 1972. Some sizable populations in the Elk River were destroyed by impoundment of Tims Ford Reservoir. The invasion of the Asian clam, and the possible invasion of the zebra mussel, also threaten remaining populations.
