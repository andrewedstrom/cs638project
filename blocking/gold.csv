    The part of the Syrian coast where this species occurs has been heavily urbanized and industrialized since the second half of the 20th century. North of Baniyas town lies Baniyas port with one of the largest oil refineries in Syria and a hydro-electric power plant. The remaining 'open space' between Baniyas and Jableh, i.e; some 10 km, is mainly used for agro-industrial purposes (greenhouse farming, citrus and olive plantations). The surface waters are polluted by untreated urban and industrial sewage, by agricultural run-off (high amounts of fertilizers and pesticides) and by heavy organic loads of hundreds of olive oil mills scattered along the coast (ICMZ-NPR 2009). Soils in the coastal area are still heavily contaminated with banned but persistent pesticides such as DDT (officially banned since 1984), Endosulfane (officially banned since 1985) and Lindane (officially banned since 2000) (Jamal 2011).

This has been caused by introduced predatory fish primarily the smallmouth bass (<i>Micropterus dolomieu</i>) in addition to habitat degradation and fragmentation (2).  As the Olifants River region experiences hot dry summers water is extracted from the main river and its tributaries to irrigate the surrounding agricultural land.  Impoundments are also constructed to store water after the winter rainy season.  Furthermore river beds are bulldozed into wide channels to prevent the adjacent land from being flooded in the rainy season (2).  Such activities greatly alter the habitat of the sawfin and restrict its ability to move freely between different areas.,CapeNature a public institution responsible for biodiversity in the Western Cape (5) classifies the sawfin as endangered which makes it an offence to remove captured fish from rivers and dams.  CapeNature also undertakes regular surveys of the Olifants River system and has successfully cultured the sawfin since 1994.  Juveniles are then introduced to suitable natural habitats or stocked into farm dams to establish refuge populations.  Small parts of the sawfin‚??s range fall within protected areas including the Cedarberg Matjies River and Oorlogskloof Nature Reserves (2).

The primary threat in the Turks and Caicos Islands is introduced mammals such as cats dogs and rats which managed to almost completely destroy one population of 5000 iguanas on Pine Cay in just three years (5). Worryingly feral cats have recently crossed a newly formed sand spit from Pine and Water Cay to Little Water Cay an important nature reserve that was previously cat-free. Feral livestock such as goats cows donkeys and horses also pose a significant threat through competing for food altering vegetation compositions of the islands and trampling soft substrates where these iguanas borrow and nest. Development for tourism is an increasing cause of habitat loss and an additional cause for concern. The population of the Bartsch‚??s iguana subspecies on Booby Cay has been protected to a degree by the fact that the cay is not readily accessible from the settlements on Mayaguana minimising disturbance. The main immediate threat to this population on Booby Cay is the presence of goats which are over-browsing vegetation and causing extensive habitat degradation. Environmental catastrophes here such as hurricanes or storm surges also pose a very real danger (1).,Many of the Turks and Caicos Islands are protected by being encompassed in national parks nature reserves and sanctuaries a number of which support Bahamas rock iguana populations. Unfortunately many of these reserves still suffer from the effects of introduced mammals and few government resources have been allocated to maintain or enforce protection of non-marine parks (1). However the establishment of the National Trust for the Turks and Caicos Islands in 1994 has significantly increased the conservation of terrestrial wildlife.

Competition from mammalian herbivores probably also occurs.  Hunting of Ricord‚??s iguanas for food and trade has increased gradually since the mid 1970s, both for local consumption as well as at a few oriental restaurants in Santo Domingo where iguanas were offered as a speciality dish.

Feral dogs first reported in 1994 are known to kill adult iguanas and predation by an exploding population of feral cats on juveniles is responsible for the deaths of many hatchlings each year (2) (5). The primary threat however comes from competition for food from feral livestock with the island teeming with sheep goats donkeys and cattle that have been released to roam freely across Anegada (2) (4). Grazing pressure from these livestock has radically changed the composition of vegetation available to the iguana shifting the species‚?? diet to rely more on plants with secondary compounds with dubious nutritional value (2).,The Anegada Iguana Recovery Programme began in 1997 which included establishing a ‚??headstart‚?? facility. This facility collects hatchlings and nurtures them in captivity until they can be safely released into the wild with the aim of combating the high rates of juvenile mortality due to cat predation by raising them until they are large enough that predation will not pose as great a threat (6). The first 24 were released into the wild in October 2003 with an 84 percent survival rate and a second group of 24 were released in October 2004 and these are currently being tracked (5). In the 1980s small numbers of these iguanas were removed from Anegada and restored to parts of their former range on Guana Island where the species appears to be doing well in the absence of introduced predators (1) (2). The Guana Island Wildlife Sanctuary continues to try to rid the island of sheep the only feral grazing competitor on the island which may improve the habitat there for the iguanas (1). The species was also later introduced to Necker Island (2). A national park designed to protect this Critically Endangered iguana on Anegada has been approved in principle by the Anegada Lands Committee but rampant debates over land ownership and property boundaries impede developments and must be resolved before this project can progress (2) (4). Further conservation actions advocated include a cat eradication programme and the construction of fences around protected areas to keep livestock out. Indeed despite the successes of the headstart programme it is imperative that efforts are made to control livestock and to secure protected land for the survival of this species. Without prompt action it has been suggested that these iguanas may become extinct on Anegada within the next decade (2). ,loss;poaching;pet; ,protected; ,3,1.0,yes,0

Habitat degradation and conversion to developments for tourism human settlements and road construction are particularly severe problems while predation from introduced mammals such as rats and mongoose also threatens many native species (6).

Today however the distribution of pine savannas dominated by the longleaf pine is less than three percent of its original extent. The dramatic decline in its distribution is attributable to over harvesting particularly during the 19th century as well as clearance for urban development agriculture and pine plantations (6). Furthermore the fragmentation and mismanagement of the remaining stands has resulted in the suppression of wildfires allowing non-fire tolerant hardwood species to outcompete the longleaf pine (2) (6) (8) (9). Consequently broadleaved hardwood forests in the region are now far more extensive than they were in pre-settlement times (9).,Considerable efforts are being made to restore longleaf pine across its natural range. Organisations such as the Longleaf Alliance are bringing together private landowners forest industries state and federal agencies conservation groups and researchers to determine the most appropriate means for revitalising this threatened ecosystem.

In addition this cycad is used in numerous ways by the local human population and some of this exploitation is having a negative impact on cycad numbers. <i>Cycas circinalis</i> is heavily harvested for its leaves with young leaves being used as food and medicine by indigenous and local communities and the mature leaves being sold in the floriculture industry (7). The biggest impact on <i>C. circinalis </i>populations however comes from the harvest of pith and male cone for the medicinal plant industry. While much of this harvest is illegal it is very difficult to patrol (7). It is not only the cycad itself that this harvesting may threaten; the harvesting of its seeds for human consumption appears to have little negative impact on <i>Cycas circinalis</i> populations but very heavy seed harvest could have an impact on the bats which reportedly feed on the seeds (7).,Significant populations of <i>Cycas circinalis</i> still exist in a number of national parks and forest reserves (2) which offers this species some protection. To reduce harvesting pressure on populations it has been suggested that people need to be encouraged to use substitutes. For example the floriculture industry could use leaves from cultivated palms that are faster growing.

This has been caused by introduced predatory fish primarily the smallmouth bass (<i>Micropterus dolomieu</i>) in addition to habitat degradation and fragmentation (2).  As the Olifants River region experiences hot dry summers water is extracted from the main river and its tributaries to irrigate the surrounding agricultural land.  Impoundments are also constructed to store water after the winter rainy season.  Furthermore river beds are bulldozed into wide channels to prevent the adjacent land from being flooded in the rainy season (2).  Such activities greatly alter the habitat of the sawfin and restrict its ability to move freely between different areas.,CapeNature a public institution responsible for biodiversity in the Western Cape (5) classifies the sawfin as endangered which makes it an offence to remove captured fish from rivers and dams.  CapeNature also undertakes regular surveys of the Olifants River system and has successfully cultured the sawfin since 1994.  Juveniles are then introduced to suitable natural habitats or stocked into farm dams to establish refuge populations.  Small parts of the sawfin‚??s range fall within protected areas including the Cedarberg Matjies River and Oorlogskloof Nature Reserves (2).

    The primary threats to the species are: degradation of water quality due to sedimentation and pollutants from urbanization and industrial activities; altered stream flow regimes and water quantity due to construction and maintenance activities; insufficient stormwater management; and impoundments (five within the Turkey Creek and Dry Creek system). Other threats include: in-stream rock extractions; off-road vehicle usage; road, culvert, bridge, gas and water easement construction and maintenance. These activities lead to water quality degradation, stream channel instability, fragmentation of habitat and hydrology, and overall changes in the geomorphology of the Turkey Creek watershed. In addition, natural waterfalls are dispersal barriers to the connectivity of the Vermilion Darter populations. The Vermilion Darter's habitat is fragmented, and the various subpopulations may be genetically isolated and are vulnerable to local extirpation.

The principle agent behind this decline was the creation of Greers Ferry Lake in 1962 which resulted in the inundation of downstream tributaries creating deep pools with increased sedimentation and lower oxygen levels in the water. As an inhabitant of shallow fast-moving streams the yellowcheek darter was displaced from much of its former range moving upstream to less suitable areas of habitat. The species‚?? migratory behaviour was also disrupted while the loss of downstream refugia made the species more vulnerable to droughts resulting in the loss of many populations (7). Other threats such as the channelization of streams for agriculture and human consumption have isolated some populations and a loss of <strong>genetic diversity</strong> has been observed due to <strong>inbreeding</strong> (3) (8).,Having suffered such a severe decline the yellowcheek darter is in drastic need of major conservation measures. Indeed the species has been proposed for Threatened Status under the U.S Endangered Species Act (9). An agreement has also been made between several conservation organisations and landowners to mitigate threats to the species protect bordering terrestrial habitats; and explore potential reintroduction programmes (3).

    This species is threatened by non-targeted hunting (Bleisch 1991) and habitat loss due to forest clearing (Bleisch 1995). It is also sometimes caught in snares set for other animals (Bleisch 1995). Previously, collection of magnolia flower buds and bark (by cutting down tress) by local villagers removed a food source of this species, but this practice has reportedly ceased (Dunyan pers. comm. 2006). There is currently construction and development for tourism, including a tourist road, cable car and hotels within the nature reserve, which are a potential threat because of habitat destruction and disturbance.

    The major threats to Ricord‚??s iguanas are from human activities resulting in habitat reduction and degradation (clearing of vegetation for agricultural use, charcoal production, harvesting of fuelwood and hardwoods, overbrowsing by free-ranging livestock, mining of limestone, illegal collection of live cacti for local and international trade), in combination with local subsistence hunting for food and predation from introduced carnivores (dogs, cats and mongooses).  Competition from mammalian herbivores probably also occurs.  Hunting of Ricord‚??s iguanas for food and trade has increased gradually since the mid 1970s, both for local consumption as well as at a few oriental restaurants in Santo Domingo where iguanas were offered as a speciality dish.  In the past, some hunters used to set up to 100 snare traps per day at the entrance of retreats, with 30-50% trapping success.  Although current populations no longer support the numbers harvested 15 years ago, iguanas continue to be captured opportunistically in all areas with remaining populations, except on Isla Cabritos where law enforcement is presently effective.

    
  ","['\n    Aside from occasional smuggling of animals across the Haitian border, compliance with international CITES trade regulations is effective.  Enforcement of national protective legislation in the Dominican Republic has improved during the past few years, but effective control is adversely influenced by a number of factors.  Clearing of natural habitat for development is not being prevented nor regulated and illegal hunting for food and the local pet market continues.

The primary threat in the Turks and Caicos Islands is introduced mammals such as cats dogs and rats which managed to almost completely destroy one population of 5000 iguanas on Pine Cay in just three years (5). Worryingly feral cats have recently crossed a newly formed sand spit from Pine and Water Cay to Little Water Cay an important nature reserve that was previously cat-free. Feral livestock such as goats cows donkeys and horses also pose a significant threat through competing for food altering vegetation compositions of the islands and trampling soft substrates where these iguanas borrow and nest. Development for tourism is an increasing cause of habitat loss and an additional cause for concern. The population of the Bartsch‚??s iguana subspecies on Booby Cay has been protected to a degree by the fact that the cay is not readily accessible from the settlements on Mayaguana minimising disturbance. The main immediate threat to this population on Booby Cay is the presence of goats which are over-browsing vegetation and causing extensive habitat degradation. Environmental catastrophes here such as hurricanes or storm surges also pose a very real danger (1).,Many of the Turks and Caicos Islands are protected by being encompassed in national parks nature reserves and sanctuaries a number of which support Bahamas rock iguana populations. Unfortunately many of these reserves still suffer from the effects of introduced mammals and few government resources have been allocated to maintain or enforce protection of non-marine parks (1). However the establishment of the National Trust for the Turks and Caicos Islands in 1994 has significantly increased the conservation of terrestrial wildlife. The National Trust has been granted stewardship of Little Water Cay and similar transfers of Little Ambergris and East Bay Cays are currently pending. On Little Water Cay boardwalks and observation towers have been constructed at two popular landing sites to reduce the damaging impacts of tourism and a visitation fee has been implemented with the proceeds going towards supporting conservation activities. A trapping programme to remove feral cats from Pine Water and (if necessary) Little Water Cays has also been established by the National Trust (5). ,loss;poaching;environmental;environment;pet; ,protected; ,5,1.0,yes,0

    Hunting for the purposes of traditional ""medicine"" is the primary threat facing this species; most of the populations that survive are heavily reduced and fragmented. Only the subpopulation at Van Long, with about 50 individuals, is thought likely to survive given the current hunting pressure; however, quarrying for limestone (cement), which is currently taking place there, has affected the ranging behaviour of the animals (T. Nadler pers. comm.). The smallest groups are extremely unlikely to survive should the one reproductively active male be taken or killed (Nadler 2004). Forest loss is a more minor threat as it occurs in degraded areas. A potential threat is the rapid development of tourist facilities adjacent to protected areas, especially around Van Long and Hoa Lu Nature Reserves.

    
  ","[""\n    This species is currently listed only as CITES Appendix II. It is considered 'endangered' in Viet Nam, and is listed as a 'most endangered' species under Annex 1B of Decree 32 (2006). It occurs in six protected areas, but many still experience high hunting pressure. Van Long Nature Reserve was established for this species in 2001, and there has been some evidence of population growth in this reserve in the past five years. The connection of forest fragments in some already protected areas, such as Van Long, could greatly increase the size and survivability of some subpopulations. Also considered as beneficial population management for this species are the translocation of severely threatened (small) groups to safe and suitable habitat, and the augmentation of existing groups with offspring from a captive population. Delacour's langurs have been successfully kept and bred in captivity at the Endangered Primate Rescue Center in Cuc Phuong National Park, Viet Nam, which is currently the only collection keeping this species (Nadler 2004). It is necessary to ensure the sustainability of these programs.

The focus of conservation efforts must fall primarily on the Cat Ba Island <strong>subspecies</strong> with possibly as few as 59 individuals remaining today. This shockingly low number is the result of a massive 98% decline over the course of 40 years from between 2500 and 2800 individuals in the 1960s to just 53 in 2000. Such a dangerously small population of Cat Ba langurs gives the impression that the Chinese <strong>subspecies</strong> <i>Trachypithecus poliocephalus leucocephalus</i> is thriving with between 600 and 800 individuals alive today. This is of course far from the truth particularly as declines were recorded in the populations at Longgang National Nature Reserve and the Fusui Rare and Precious Animal Reserve in 1998 (5).,With just 53 Cat Ba langurs in the wild and two in captivity at the Endangered Primate Rescue Centre of Cuc Phuong National Park the Cat Ba Langur Conservation Project was started in 2000 by M≈±nster Zoo and the Zoological Society for the Conservation of Species and Populations (ZGAP). Given the cause of the langur‚??s decline the main aim of the project was to halt poaching with the additional intention of promoting conservation awareness amongst the inhabitants of Cat Ba Island. The project has been extremely successful in dramatically reducing deaths as a result of poaching bringing the number from 30 deaths in the eight months prior to its start to three deaths in the first four years of the project. In this time nine langurs were born and have survived. The langurs are closely monitored and protection measures are in place particularly in the newly created langur sanctuary within the National Park. This highly protected area is home to 20 individuals from a large reproducing group which are protected by a rotation of 20 rangers ‚?? an incredible ratio of one ranger to one langur. The sanctuary is visibly marked around its circumference and is inaccessible to tourists. The Cat Ba Langur Conservation Project has constructed two new ranger stations provided boats to ease patrols and has even seen the voluntary relocation of several local floating households to support the rangers (3). The Cat Ba langur also has the support of Flora and Fauna International‚??s Flagship Species Fund (5) and the Cat Hai District Women‚??s Union who implemented a project entitled ‚??Contributing to Biodiversity Conservation in Cat Ba National Park through Community Activity‚??

A decrease in water quality was probably the most significant agent as the loss of the species from the Cahaba River coincided with an increase in nitrogen and phosphorous caused by sewage discharge. This led to higher algal biomass and decreased levels of dissolved oxygen in the water (4) (5). The blue shiner is also threatened by increased siltation as it relies on sight to detect its prey while in Georgia urbanisation and resulting pollution and water extraction threatens the species‚?? habitat. In many areas the blue shiner now exists in small highly fragmented populations which are more vulnerable to habitat degradation and a loss of <strong>genetic diversity</strong> greatly increasing the species‚?? extinction risk (5) (7).,The future of the blue shiner very much depends on the protection of its habitat particularly the Conasauga River. Fortunately for this rare species efforts are underway to protect this fragile environment. The Nature Conservancy is working with private landowners and government agencies to protect the Conasauga River and conserve the populations of rare and endangered fish that inhabit its waters (5) (8).

In the Philippines large areas of forest had already been cleared by the end of the nineteenth century for agricultural expansion which continued throughout the twentieth century (7). However the most extensive and rapid deforestation in the latter half of the century has been caused by commercial logging with has particularly impacted the valuable primary lowland dipterocarp forests which shrunk from an estimated 10 million hectares in the 1950s to only one million by the late 1980s (7). Forest clearance and habitat degradation throughout Borneo and the Philippines may also be having a detrimental effect on the tree‚??s natural pollinators reducing the rate at which the species can reproduce and recover its populations (4).,This threatened species is located in a proposed reserve site (1) which if awarded official reserve status in the future would confer some degree of protection to the species. The Philippines‚?? Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR) has also established a <strong>genebank</strong> of economically useful <strong>endemic</strong> and endangered forest tree species including white seraya (8). This project has involved collecting and propagating the species to be maintained in an arboretum and gathering data on growth and survival of the species planted (8). A large scale project has also been initiated in Sabah Malaysia to rehabilitate 25000 hectares of logged forests using indigenous tree species such as dipterocarps in order to counteract atmospheric carbon dioxide (9). <i>Parashorea malaanonan</i> has been one of the main dipterocarp species planted to date (9). Indeed although such conservation efforts are not directed specifically at white seraya the tree is likely to benefit indirectly from a variety of such efforts to conserve lowland forests generally. Whether for environmental concerns or to protect the host of endangered species that inhabit lowland forests across Borneo and the Philippines conservation of such forests will undoubtedly help preserve this enormous tree which needs to be recognised for its crucial ecological importance as much as for its economic value. , , ,0,0.0,yes,0

In Indonesia habitat destruction is a major problem as a result of illegal and commercial logging and large agricultural projects such as rubber and oil palm plantations (7).  Sumatra has a very high rate of habitat loss with some areas losing up to 65 percent of their forest cover in the last 25 years (8).¬†Only 33.8 percent of Sumatra remains covered by <strong>primary forest</strong> and only 1.3 percent of this is upper montane vegetation in which <i>Nepenthes lavicola </i>is found.  The highly localised distribution of <i>Nepenthes lavicola</i> makes it particularly susceptible to the impacts of habitat disturbance or catastrophic environmental events such as drought or fire.  In addition highland plants such as <i>Nepenthes lavicola</i> take longer than lowland plants to recover from any disturbance as growth is slower (2).,<i>Nepenthes lavicola </i>is listed on Appendix II of the Convention of International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) which limits international trade in this species.  However this is very difficult to regulate.  Trade in <i>Nepenthes</i> species does not need to be identified down to species level and plants simply labelled as <i>Nepenthes </i>accounted for 94 percent of exported plants between 1988 and 1993.  This needs to be remedied and urgent attention is required to close other trade loopholes. Presently over-collection does not seem to pose an extensive threat for <i>Nepenthes lavicola</i> and artificial cultivation reduces this threat further (2).  Conservation efforts can be made more effective not only by the implementation and enforcement of protective laws but also by the encouragement of artificial propagation and establishment of habitat reserves (9). ,loss;environmental;environment; ,cites; ,3,1.0,yes,0

Since lungless salamanders need a damp environment to maintain the moist skin on which oxygen uptake depends (4) any alteration in moisture conditions poses a severe threat. Therefore although it still survives in shaded plantations and sugarcane fields any clearance of these to create more open drier habitats would have a negative impact on this species (1). Similarly climate change may also pose a threat and already appears to be causing dramatic declines in other Central American salamanders (12).

This has been caused by introduced predatory fish primarily the smallmouth bass (<i>Micropterus dolomieu</i>) in addition to habitat degradation and fragmentation (2).  As the Olifants River region experiences hot dry summers water is extracted from the main river and its tributaries to irrigate the surrounding agricultural land.  Impoundments are also constructed to store water after the winter rainy season.  Furthermore river beds are bulldozed into wide channels to prevent the adjacent land from being flooded in the rainy season (2).  Such activities greatly alter the habitat of the sawfin and restrict its ability to move freely between different areas.,CapeNature a public institution responsible for biodiversity in the Western Cape (5) classifies the sawfin as endangered which makes it an offence to remove captured fish from rivers and dams.

The primary threat in the Turks and Caicos Islands is introduced mammals such as cats dogs and rats which managed to almost completely destroy one population of 5000 iguanas on Pine Cay in just three years (5). Worryingly feral cats have recently crossed a newly formed sand spit from Pine and Water Cay to Little Water Cay an important nature reserve that was previously cat-free. Feral livestock such as goats cows donkeys and horses also pose a significant threat through competing for food altering vegetation compositions of the islands and trampling soft substrates where these iguanas borrow and nest. Development for tourism is an increasing cause of habitat loss and an additional cause for concern. The population of the Bartsch‚??s iguana subspecies on Booby Cay has been protected to a degree by the fact that the cay is not readily accessible from the settlements on Mayaguana minimising disturbance. The main immediate threat to this population on Booby Cay is the presence of goats which are over-browsing vegetation and causing extensive habitat degradation. Environmental catastrophes here such as hurricanes or storm surges also pose a very real danger (1).,Many of the Turks and Caicos Islands are protected by being encompassed in national parks nature reserves and sanctuaries a number of which support Bahamas rock iguana populations. Unfortunately many of these reserves still suffer from the effects of introduced mammals and few government resources have been allocated to maintain or enforce protection of non-marine parks (1). However the establishment of the National Trust for the Turks and Caicos Islands in 1994 has significantly increased the conservation of terrestrial wildlife. The National Trust has been granted stewardship of Little Water Cay and similar transfers of Little Ambergris and East Bay Cays are currently pending. On Little Water Cay boardwalks and observation towers have been constructed at two popular landing sites to reduce the damaging impacts of tourism and a visitation fee has been implemented with the proceeds going towards supporting conservation activities.

In the Philippines large areas of forest had already been cleared by the end of the nineteenth century for agricultural expansion which continued throughout the twentieth century (7). However the most extensive and rapid deforestation in the latter half of the century has been caused by commercial logging with has particularly impacted the valuable primary lowland dipterocarp forests which shrunk from an estimated 10 million hectares in the 1950s to only one million by the late 1980s (7). Forest clearance and habitat degradation throughout Borneo and the Philippines may also be having a detrimental effect on the tree‚??s natural pollinators reducing the rate at which the species can reproduce and recover its populations (4).,This threatened species is located in a proposed reserve site (1) which if awarded official reserve status in the future would confer some degree of protection to the species. The Philippines‚?? Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR) has also established a <strong>genebank</strong> of economically useful <strong>endemic</strong> and endangered forest tree species including white seraya (8). This project has involved collecting and propagating the species to be maintained in an arboretum and gathering data on growth and survival of the species planted (8). A large scale project has also been initiated in Sabah Malaysia to rehabilitate 25000 hectares of logged forests using indigenous tree species such as dipterocarps in order to counteract atmospheric carbon dioxide (9). <i>Parashorea malaanonan</i> has been one of the main dipterocarp species planted to date (9). Indeed although such conservation efforts are not directed specifically at white seraya the tree is likely to benefit indirectly from a variety of such efforts to conserve lowland forests generally. Whether for environmental concerns or to protect the host of endangered species that inhabit lowland forests across Borneo and the Philippines conservation of such forests will undoubtedly help preserve this enormous tree which needs to be recognised for its crucial ecological importance as much as for its economic value. , , ,0,0.0,yes,0

The biggest impact on <i>C. circinalis </i>populations however comes from the harvest of pith and male cone for the medicinal plant industry. While much of this harvest is illegal it is very difficult to patrol (7). It is not only the cycad itself that this harvesting may threaten; the harvesting of its seeds for human consumption appears to have little negative impact on <i>Cycas circinalis</i> populations but very heavy seed harvest could have an impact on the bats which reportedly feed on the seeds (7).,Significant populations of <i>Cycas circinalis</i> still exist in a number of national parks and forest reserves (2) which offers this species some protection.

Permanent occupation of suitable habitat as a result of increasing human and livestock populations is exerting tremendous pressure on nyala habitat throughout the range, with anecdotal evidence suggesting mountain nyalas actively avoid livestock (Sillero-Zubiri in press).

Trophy hunting blocks in Arsi have been hunted out and concessions moved to Bale, with continued pressure by the industry for additional hunting blocks and larger quotas.

    Habitat loss and degradation appears to be the major threat. Its habitat occurs on land under a variety of tenures, including national parks, state forests, local government reserves, grazing leasehold properties, crown land, freehold lands and road reserves. Ninety-seven percent of frog sites are located on unprotected land, most of which is in state forest or timber reserve. There are several activities likely to occur on these lands, which may impact on the amount and quality of the frog‚??s habitat, including grazing, logging, road works, clearing and development. Habitat in the south-east of Timber Reserve 245 and Tumoulin State Forest has been severely affected by cattle grazing. Grazing and trampling has the potential to degrade and destroy the seepage areas used by the frogs for breeding. Similarly, erosion and subsequent siltation may cover seepage areas if future logging or clearing occurs. Roads and cuttings can alter the water quality and hydrology and may affect seepage areas and first order streams. Regrowth forest uses more water than old growth and therefore has the potential to reduce seepages. The population at the Ravenshoe rubbish dump has declined.

During <strong>hibernation</strong> the Indiana bat is vulnerable to human disturbance which can cause direct mortality or cause them to rouse and deplete their important energy reserves.  Disturbance can be in the form of researchers vandalism and the commercialization of caves allowing tourists to visit caves.  Modifications to mines and caves such as the construction of gates to restrict human access alter airflow temperature and humidity to which the Indiana bat is very sensitive; or gates may not allow sufficient flight space for the bats and thus block them from a critical <strong>hibernation</strong> site (2) (3).  As Indiana bats <strong>hibernate</strong> in very large numbers in only a few caves this makes them particularly vulnerable to disturbance and natural disasters as a large proportion of the total population can be affected by a single event (3).,As well as being classified as Endangered on the IUCN Red List 2007 (1) the Indiana bat is also listed as Endangered under the Endangered Species Act of 1973.  As an outcome of this the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service has drawn up a recovery plan with the goal of improving the status of the Indiana bat so that it can be removed from the Endangered Species List (3).  To reach the goal a number of actions are required; conserving and managing the hibernacula and the summer habitat conducting further essential research and implementing a public information and outreach program.  Dependent on funding and the implementation of conservation actions it has been estimated that the species can fully recover by the year 2027 (3).  At present the primary conservation effort has been to control human access of caves by erecting properly designed gates that keep people from disturbing hibernating bats while maintaining temperature humidity and allowing access for bats (3). ,loss; ,endangered species act; ,1,1.0,yes,0

    The major threats to Ricord‚??s iguanas are from human activities resulting in habitat reduction and degradation (clearing of vegetation for agricultural use, charcoal production, harvesting of fuelwood and hardwoods, overbrowsing by free-ranging livestock, mining of limestone, illegal collection of live cacti for local and international trade), in combination with local subsistence hunting for food and predation from introduced carnivores (dogs, cats and mongooses).  Competition from mammalian herbivores probably also occurs.  Hunting of Ricord‚??s iguanas for food and trade has increased gradually since the mid 1970s, both for local consumption as well as at a few oriental restaurants in Santo Domingo where iguanas were offered as a speciality dish.  In the past, some hunters used to set up to 100 snare traps per day at the entrance of retreats, with 30-50% trapping success.  Although current populations no longer support the numbers harvested 15 years ago, iguanas continue to be captured opportunistically in all areas with remaining populations, except on Isla Cabritos where law enforcement is presently effective.

Similarly climate change may also pose a threat and already appears to be causing dramatic declines in other Central American salamanders (12).

Owing to the unprecedented level of scientific interest that surrounded the little plant in the aftermath of its re-discovery local people became convinced of the plant‚??s medicinal properties (2).

    Historical exploitation for its valuable timber during the 19th centry led to a reduction of up to 95%. One consequence of this was the expansion of fynbos, a highly flammable vegetation formation. More frequent and more intense fires prevent regeneration; surviving trees are restricted to rocky ridges, ledges, and outcrops mostly beyond reach of the flames. Natural regeneration is also hampered as a result of granivory and herbivory by native rodents.

The wood is considered enormously valuable being very fragrant and resistant to termites borers and fungal disease. It is used locally for making carvings boxes and furniture sold to tourists and is also sold abroad for light construction and flooring. The timber is thought to be particularly good for boat-building to the point that fishery officials have urged that remaining supplies be reserved for the Lake Malawi fishing industry. The Forestry Department of Malawi have recently agreed to supply Mulanje Cedar to build 450 boats for this purpose (11). The tree‚??s decline has been somewhat stemmed by a ban on felling allowing exploitation only of dead trees but illegal felling and killing of trees continues at an alarming rate. The Mulanje Mountain Forest Reserve is also generally threatened by encroachment and large-scale development such as the continual threat of bauxite mining. Additionally there is concern that mature individuals appear to be dying at a high rate thought possibly to be due to their high sensitivity to forest fires and susceptibility to attacks by a species of aphid (3). Regeneration on the other hand seems to depend on fire and is extremely poor. In addition <i>Pinus patula</i> (originally a commercial plantation species) has invaded a number of areas suitable for <i>Widdringtonia</i> colonisation (5) (9). All these threats have greatly impacted the Mulanje cedar; a 2007 study found that the remaining Mulanje cedar forests had been reduced by 40 percent over the previous 15 years (3). Out of the remaining 845.3 hectares of forest identified over 32 percent of standing Mulanje cedar was found to be dead (3). As so much dead wood is available for utilisation there should be no reason to cut live Mulanje cedar (3).,All Mulanje cedars are protected within the Mulanje Mountain Forest Reserve and licences are available now only for the exploitation of dead trees from the Forestry Department of Malawi (3) (9). The Mulanje Mountain Conservation Trust has also been set up to provide long-term support for the research and conservation of biological diversity in the Mulanje Mountain Forest Reserve and the sustainable utilisation of its natural resources. The Trust is working with the Forestry Department of Malawi in bringing in community participation to manage the resources of the forest reserve and maximise the benefits among resource users (12). Not only is the Mulanje cedar a national emblem to Malawi but it is also of critical financial importance to this relatively poor country and as such its protection and sustainable use is a national priority (6). ,fishing;disease; ,protected; ,2,1.0,yes,0

Previously capture of this species for the international pet and research trade contributed to population declines but the axolotl now breeds well in captivity alleviating this threat. It was also captured for consumption by local people although numbers are now too low for this. The most significant threat to the axolotl is the increasing pollution of the lakes and canal system as Mexico City continues to grow (1). Land drainage flood control and sewage disposal methods from the 17th century to the present have all contributed to the destruction of the water system of Mexico City (3).,Recent stabilisation of axolotl numbers may be attributable to the restoration of the Parco Ecologico Xochimilco over the last 20 years.

This has been caused by introduced predatory fish primarily the smallmouth bass (<i>Micropterus dolomieu</i>) in addition to habitat degradation and fragmentation (2).  As the Olifants River region experiences hot dry summers water is extracted from the main river and its tributaries to irrigate the surrounding agricultural land.  Impoundments are also constructed to store water after the winter rainy season.  Furthermore river beds are bulldozed into wide channels to prevent the adjacent land from being flooded in the rainy season (2).  Such activities greatly alter the habitat of the sawfin and restrict its ability to move freely between different areas.,CapeNature a public institution responsible for biodiversity in the Western Cape (5) classifies the sawfin as endangered which makes it an offence to remove captured fish from rivers and dams.  CapeNature also undertakes regular surveys of the Olifants River system and has successfully cultured the sawfin since 1994.  Juveniles are then introduced to suitable natural habitats or stocked into farm dams to establish refuge populations.  Small parts of the sawfin‚??s range fall within protected areas including the Cedarberg Matjies River and Oorlogskloof Nature Reserves (2).  However to ensure the sawfin‚??s future it is vital to protect the habitat in the specific tributaries and the small section of the Olifants River mainstream where the sawfin remains abundant.

Much of Sri Lanka‚??s original tropical moist montane forest has been cleared during the last two centuries for cinchona coffee tea rubber and cardamom plantations for grazing livestock by logging companies illegal logging and removal of timber by peripheral villagers (5) (8). The montane forests of the Knuckles Mountains where this species is found have been particularly affected by cardamom cultivation which requires that much of the forest understorey is cleared and although the canopy is retained for shade continuing weeding of the area to remove competing vegetation prevents natural regeneration of the forest. Some areas are also still cultivated for vegetables using traditional slash and burn techniques and on occasion this can lead to out-of-control forest fires (6). With a rapidly growing population and increasing demand for agricultural land the destruction of montane forests continues at an alarming rate. Further more there is intensive use of pesticides on vegetable cultivations and tea plantations in Sri Lanka which could be having a serious polluting affect. Although the impact these chemicals are having on non-target species is not yet known studies elsewhere indicate that they could potentially be devastating with possibilities for <strong>bioaccumulation</strong>. There is also evidence in the tropical moist montane forests of the Knuckles Mountains of large-scale forest die-back thought to be the result of acid rain and these forests are considered particularly at risk from climate change especially global warming (5).,Project Knuckles 2004 and a follow-up expedition in 2005 were initiated to conduct the first in-depth study of reptiles and the primary threats facing them in the Knuckles Mountain Range (6). It was discovered that the region held some of the highest reptile diversity in the country and is therefore an important site for conservation. Tennent‚??s leaf-nosed lizard was one of three target species studied (9). As of 2000 areas above 1067 m above sea level were given protected status as conservation forest. As such cardamom cultivation has had to be abandoned in the area. However rather than allowing the natural regeneration of native forest the cardamom appears to have been replaced by a series of invasive weeds such as mistflower (<i>Eupatorium riparium</i>) and Lantana (<i>Lantana camara</i>) (6). Fortunately Tennent‚??s leaf-nosed lizards appear to be fairly adaptable and tolerant of some degree of habitat disturbance having been recorded from forests under planted with cardamom and pine plantations providing hope for the long-term survival of this unique unusual looking reptile (3) (6). ,loss;fragmentation;pet; ,protected; ,3,1.0,yes,1

Ghana and Liberia both have a higher percentage of their natural forests remaining but even in these countries populations of baku have experienced significant declines and the extinction of this important species is a possibility (2).  Illegal and poorly controlled logging pose the greatest threat to the baku‚??s continued existence (2) but it has also been reported that the reduction of forest elephant numbers in certain areas may limit the natural regeneration of baku (2) (8).,Baku trees are protected by law in C√¥te d'Ivoire and due to the problem of overexploitation of timbers Ghana and Liberia have imposed bans on the exporting of baku in log form (8) (9).   Despite these measures improved regulation of the timber trade is still urgently required (2).  It has been recommended that re-planting in Liberia is necessary to prevent this species‚?? extinction (8) and in all areas in which it is harvested certified sustainable forest management to Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) standards are required (2).  The Global Trees Campaign was set up with the aim of saving the world‚??s most threatened tree species of which baku is one of and as a result Flora and Fauna International is currently working in Liberia with local and international partners to improve the basis for the conservation and sustainable management of forests (2).

This has been caused by introduced predatory fish primarily the smallmouth bass (<i>Micropterus dolomieu</i>) in addition to habitat degradation and fragmentation (2).  As the Olifants River region experiences hot dry summers water is extracted from the main river and its tributaries to irrigate the surrounding agricultural land.  Impoundments are also constructed to store water after the winter rainy season.  Furthermore river beds are bulldozed into wide channels to prevent the adjacent land from being flooded in the rainy season (2).  Such activities greatly alter the habitat of the sawfin and restrict its ability to move freely between different areas.,CapeNature a public institution responsible for biodiversity in the Western Cape (5) classifies the sawfin as endangered which makes it an offence to remove captured fish from rivers and dams.  CapeNature also undertakes regular surveys of the Olifants River system and has successfully cultured the sawfin since 1994.  Juveniles are then introduced to suitable natural habitats or stocked into farm dams to establish refuge populations.  Small parts of the sawfin‚??s range fall within protected areas including the Cedarberg Matjies River and Oorlogskloof Nature Reserves (2).  However to ensure the sawfin‚??s future it is vital to protect the habitat in the specific tributaries and the small section of the Olifants River mainstream where the sawfin remains abundant.

Deforestation as a result of agricultural industrial and residential development has led to habitat loss and fragmentation and the consequent isolation of subpopulations which impedes out-breeding and genetic diversity. From 1956 to 1993 Sri Lanka lost more than 50 percent of its forests to human activities followed by a similar rate of decline between 1994 and 2003. This species has also suffered from hunting and illegal trade of its meat and skin with the skin used to make drums in some areas. The purple-faced langur is hunted mainly for subsistence living and trade at local village level. According to continuing trends populations of this species are predicted to decline by more than 50 percent within the next 11 to 22 years (1).,The commercial exploitation of purple-faced langurs is regulated by their listing on Appendix II of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) (3). All four <strong>subspecies</strong> are also protected under the Flora and Fauna Protection Ordinance 1993 and exist in a number of protected areas (1). However the issue of habitat loss still places these <strong>subspecies</strong> classified as Endangered and Critically Endangered at serious risk of extinction (1). Indeed the Critically Endangered western purple-faced langur (<i>T. v. nestor</i>) was officially recognised in 2004 as one of the world‚??s 25 most endangered primates. This <strong>subspecies</strong> requires good canopy cover but possibly fewer than three forests currently exist within Sri Lanka that can support viable populations and none of these are within protected areas. Furthermore the human-modified areas that support much of the langur population such as gardens and rubber plantations are under private ownership and therefore unstable changing rapidly due to human population expansion and development. Censuses are therefore urgently needed to identify forest areas suitable for conservation. Further studies are also essential to better understand the decline of sub-populations in both space and time in the extremely disturbed habitats where these langurs survive today (6). ,loss;fragmentation;hunting; ,cites;protected; ,3,2.0,yes,0

The biggest impact on <i>C. circinalis </i>populations however comes from the harvest of pith and male cone for the medicinal plant industry. While much of this harvest is illegal it is very difficult to patrol (7). It is not only the cycad itself that this harvesting may threaten; the harvesting of its seeds for human consumption appears to have little negative impact on <i>Cycas circinalis</i> populations but very heavy seed harvest could have an impact on the bats which reportedly feed on the seeds (7).,Significant populations of <i>Cycas circinalis</i> still exist in a number of national parks and forest reserves (2) which offers this species some protection. To reduce harvesting pressure on populations it has been suggested that people need to be encouraged to use substitutes.

In many areas the blue shiner now exists in small highly fragmented populations which are more vulnerable to habitat degradation and a loss of <strong>genetic diversity</strong> greatly increasing the species‚?? extinction risk (5) (7).,The future of the blue shiner very much depends on the protection of its habitat particularly the Conasauga River. Fortunately for this rare species efforts are underway to protect this fragile environment. The Nature Conservancy is working with private landowners and government agencies to protect the Conasauga River and conserve the populations of rare and endangered fish that inhabit its waters (5) (8). The National Resources Conservation Service is also working to protect <strong>riparian</strong> habitat around the Conasauga River and to tackle threats (5) (9).

Road kills may pose a significant threat particularly during the breeding season when the toads migrate to the breeding sites (1) (2) and urban development can also increase the physical barriers to such movements (2). In addition artificial water bodies with vertical sides such as swimming pools and stormwater drains can present death traps to toads while further threats at some breeding sites include pollution and introduced species such as predatory fish invasive plants and captive ducks which can consume eggs and tadpoles. The replacement of lawns and flowerbeds with stone and paving may also be reducing available foraging habitat (2) and there is increasing concern that the introduced guttural toad <i>Amietophrynus gutturalis</i> may compete with the western leopard toad for food and resources (8). An isolated population in the east of the range appears to be most under threat despite occurring in the least urbanised habitat (9).,The western leopard toad is legally protected within South Africa (2) and also occurs in some protected areas such as the Agulhas National Park and in the northern parts of Cape of Good Hope Nature Reserve. However most of its habitat occurs outside of reserves and is unprotected (1) (2). Fortunately a number of organisations are working to involve the public and private landholders in the toad‚??s conservation. In 2007 the Western Leopard Toad Conservation Committee (WLT-CC) was formed and are helping to draft a Biodiversity Management Plan for the species (2) (9). Volunteers help rescue toads from roads during the breeding season and photographs sent in by the public are being used to monitor the toad population identifying individuals by their unique markings (2) (5). Genetic studies radio-tracking and monitoring of the invasive guttural toad are also underway (2) (5) (8) and local residents have been given advice on making swimming pools safer for toads (2). By raising awareness of urban conservation issues and promoting more ‚??ecofriendly‚?? gardening practices the conservation of this beautiful amphibian is also likely to benefit a range of other wildlife in the Cape Province (2). ,invasive;pet;pollution; ,protected; ,3,1.0,yes,0

The biggest impact on <i>C. circinalis </i>populations however comes from the harvest of pith and male cone for the medicinal plant industry. While much of this harvest is illegal it is very difficult to patrol (7). It is not only the cycad itself that this harvesting may threaten; the harvesting of its seeds for human consumption appears to have little negative impact on <i>Cycas circinalis</i> populations but very heavy seed harvest could have an impact on the bats which reportedly feed on the seeds (7).,Significant populations of <i>Cycas circinalis</i> still exist in a number of national parks and forest reserves (2) which offers this species some protection. To reduce harvesting pressure on populations it has been suggested that people need to be encouraged to use substitutes. For example the floriculture industry could use leaves from cultivated palms that are faster growing.

In the Philippines large areas of forest had already been cleared by the end of the nineteenth century for agricultural expansion which continued throughout the twentieth century (7). However the most extensive and rapid deforestation in the latter half of the century has been caused by commercial logging with has particularly impacted the valuable primary lowland dipterocarp forests which shrunk from an estimated 10 million hectares in the 1950s to only one million by the late 1980s (7). Forest clearance and habitat degradation throughout Borneo and the Philippines may also be having a detrimental effect on the tree‚??s natural pollinators reducing the rate at which the species can reproduce and recover its populations (4).,This threatened species is located in a proposed reserve site (1) which if awarded official reserve status in the future would confer some degree of protection to the species. The Philippines‚?? Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR) has also established a <strong>genebank</strong> of economically useful <strong>endemic</strong> and endangered forest tree species including white seraya (8). This project has involved collecting and propagating the species to be maintained in an arboretum and gathering data on growth and survival of the species planted (8). A large scale project has also been initiated in Sabah Malaysia to rehabilitate 25000 hectares of logged forests using indigenous tree species such as dipterocarps in order to counteract atmospheric carbon dioxide (9). <i>Parashorea malaanonan</i> has been one of the main dipterocarp species planted to date (9). Indeed although such conservation efforts are not directed specifically at white seraya the tree is likely to benefit indirectly from a variety of such efforts to conserve lowland forests generally.

Although at present there are no signs of reduction of population size due to this take off it must be carefully monitored in the future to assure the survivorship of the species (5). Furthermore large-scale deforestation predation by introduced species and encroachment by humans are all posing threats to†the golden frog†(4).,All mantella frogs are listed on Appendix II of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) which controls international trade in these species (2). The golden frog is bred in captivity in a number of zoos and other breeding facilities including the Detroit Zoological Institute‚??s National Amphibian Conservation Centre which breeds hundreds each year for use in breeding programmes in other institutions (6). The provision of captive-bred individuals to zoos reduces the stress on wild populations caused by collection. Captive breeding programmes may also provide a genetic reservoir of a species to safeguard it should the population undergo a drastic decline or even become extinct; they also provide sources of animals for reintroduction to the wild and allow research to be carried out (6). Although captive breeding is an important facet of any conservation programme protection of the remaining wild populations and the habitat on which they depend is of great importance (7). ,pet; ,cites;captive breeding; ,1,2.0,yes,0

Since lungless salamanders need a damp environment to maintain the moist skin on which oxygen uptake depends (4) any alteration in moisture conditions poses a severe threat. Therefore although it still survives in shaded plantations and sugarcane fields any clearance of these to create more open drier habitats would have a negative impact on this species (1). Similarly climate change may also pose a threat and already appears to be causing dramatic declines in other Central American salamanders (12). Although there is not yet any direct evidence that the fungal disease chytridiomycosis has contributed to these declines its role in the decline of many other amphibian species suggests that it may also be a potential threat (12).,No specific conservation measures are currently known to be in place for Salvin‚??s mushroomtongue salamander but the maintenance of shaded habitats has been identified as being important to its long-term survival (1). The species may potentially occur within the Parque Nacional El Imposible in El Salvador although this is not yet confirmed.

In Indonesia habitat destruction is a major problem as a result of illegal and commercial logging and large agricultural projects such as rubber and oil palm plantations (7).  Sumatra has a very high rate of habitat loss with some areas losing up to 65 percent of their forest cover in the last 25 years (8).¬†Only 33.8 percent of Sumatra remains covered by <strong>primary forest</strong> and only 1.3 percent of this is upper montane vegetation in which <i>Nepenthes lavicola </i>is found.  The highly localised distribution of <i>Nepenthes lavicola</i> makes it particularly susceptible to the impacts of habitat disturbance or catastrophic environmental events such as drought or fire.

This has been caused by introduced predatory fish primarily the smallmouth bass (<i>Micropterus dolomieu</i>) in addition to habitat degradation and fragmentation (2).  As the Olifants River region experiences hot dry summers water is extracted from the main river and its tributaries to irrigate the surrounding agricultural land.  Impoundments are also constructed to store water after the winter rainy season.  Furthermore river beds are bulldozed into wide channels to prevent the adjacent land from being flooded in the rainy season (2).  Such activities greatly alter the habitat of the sawfin and restrict its ability to move freely between different areas.,CapeNature a public institution responsible for biodiversity in the Western Cape (5) classifies the sawfin as endangered which makes it an offence to remove captured fish from rivers and dams.  CapeNature also undertakes regular surveys of the Olifants River system and has successfully cultured the sawfin since 1994.

Despite attempts to manage stellate sturgeon stocks illegal fishing and black market trade in caviar are threatening to drive this already endangered species to extinction (2) (7).,In 1998 the stellate sturgeon was listed by the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) meaning that all international trade in this species is controlled by maximum export quotas and trade permits (2) (3). The countries which are party to the CITES agreement must agree on sustainable catch and export quotas based on scientific surveys and must adopt regional conservation strategies and attempt to combat illegal fishing. The strict enforcement of these regulations meant that in 2006 caviar export was banned for all of the countries bordering the Caspian Sea since the countries failed to provide sufficient information about the sustainability of their catch. This promoted an agreement between the countries to reduce their stellate sturgeon caviar export quotas in 2007 by over 25 percent (8). The countries bordering the Black Sea have adopted an even stricter policy regarding their sturgeon stocks maintaining a zero quota policy which has continued into 2008 (9). Whether these reduced quotas will prove sufficient to allow the stellate sturgeon‚??s population to recover remains to be seen. ,fishing;overfishing;pollution; ,cites; ,3,1.0,yes,0

Suitable forest habitat is diminishing as a result of land clearance for agriculture and livestock timber harvesting for charcoal and construction and small-scale mining for gemstones (4) and even within a so-called protected area where this species occurs an annual deforestation rate of 1.2 percent has been recorded (6). Whilst taboos against hunting once existed in many parts of Madagascar the increase in immigrants without belief in such taboos has led to a worrying growth in hunting (2). Such threats have already reduced this species‚?? population to perilously low levels - in 2003-2004 it was estimated there were only 915 individuals remaining ‚?? and continue to push Perrier‚??s sifaka towards extinction (6). Such a small population is at great risk of problems arising from loss of <strong>genetic variation</strong> making the long term viability of this species highly questionable (2) (6).,Analamerana Special Reserve harbours the majority of the Perrier‚??s sifaka population (1) although rather than offering the protection this rare species requires forest within the reserve is still being gradually destroyed (1) (6) and this species clearly requires further protection if it is going to survive.

Habitat degradation and conversion to developments for tourism human settlements and road construction are particularly severe problems while predation from introduced mammals such as rats and mongoose also threatens many native species (6). As a result of these threats the range of the Virgin Islands coqui has become highly fragmented and there is an ongoing decline in the quality of its habitat.

During <strong>hibernation</strong> the Indiana bat is vulnerable to human disturbance which can cause direct mortality or cause them to rouse and deplete their important energy reserves.  Disturbance can be in the form of researchers vandalism and the commercialization of caves allowing tourists to visit caves.  Modifications to mines and caves such as the construction of gates to restrict human access alter airflow temperature and humidity to which the Indiana bat is very sensitive; or gates may not allow sufficient flight space for the bats and thus block them from a critical <strong>hibernation</strong> site (2) (3).  As Indiana bats <strong>hibernate</strong> in very large numbers in only a few caves this makes them particularly vulnerable to disturbance and natural disasters as a large proportion of the total population can be affected by a single event (3).,As well as being classified as Endangered on the IUCN Red List 2007 (1) the Indiana bat is also listed as Endangered under the Endangered Species Act of 1973.  As an outcome of this the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service has drawn up a recovery plan with the goal of improving the status of the Indiana bat so that it can be removed from the Endangered Species List (3).  To reach the goal a number of actions are required; conserving and managing the hibernacula and the summer habitat conducting further essential research and implementing a public information and outreach program.  Dependent on funding and the implementation of conservation actions it has been estimated that the species can fully recover by the year 2027 (3).  At present the primary conservation effort has been to control human access of caves by erecting properly designed gates that keep people from disturbing hibernating bats while maintaining temperature humidity and allowing access for bats (3). ,loss; ,endangered species act; ,1,1.0,yes,0

    The major threats to Ricord‚??s iguanas are from human activities resulting in habitat reduction and degradation (clearing of vegetation for agricultural use, charcoal production, harvesting of fuelwood and hardwoods, overbrowsing by free-ranging livestock, mining of limestone, illegal collection of live cacti for local and international trade), in combination with local subsistence hunting for food and predation from introduced carnivores (dogs, cats and mongooses).  Competition from mammalian herbivores probably also occurs.  Hunting of Ricord‚??s iguanas for food and trade has increased gradually since the mid 1970s, both for local consumption as well as at a few oriental restaurants in Santo Domingo where iguanas were offered as a speciality dish.  In the past, some hunters used to set up to 100 snare traps per day at the entrance of retreats, with 30-50% trapping success.  Although current populations no longer support the numbers harvested 15 years ago, iguanas continue to be captured opportunistically in all areas with remaining populations, except on Isla Cabritos where law enforcement is presently effective.

    
  ","['\n    Aside from occasional smuggling of animals across the Haitian border, compliance with international CITES trade regulations is effective.  Enforcement of national protective legislation in the Dominican Republic has improved during the past few years, but effective control is adversely influenced by a number of factors.  Clearing of natural habitat for development is not being prevented nor regulated and illegal hunting for food and the local pet market continues.  ', <br/>, ' ', <br/>, 'Ricord‚??s iguana is partially protected in two areas.  In the Neiba Valley, about 60% of the area supporting iguanas, including Isla Cabritos and a section of the south shore of Lake Enriquillo, is protected within the recently created Lago Enriquillo National Park.  The Isla Cabritos population has been protected within Isla Cabritos National Park since 1974.  ', <br/>, ' ', <br/>, 'In the Barahona Peninsula range, two protected areas, Parque Nacional Jaragua and the Acetillar Scenic Reserve, cover most of the remaining distribution of the species to the north and east of Cabo Rojo.  Ricord‚??s iguanas are only known from the park‚??s western boundary, where conflicts with limestone mining concessions on both sides of the park border continue to be unresolved.  Until now, no formal management has been established in the Acetillar reserve, and the habitat is impacted by a variety of activities.    ', <br/>, ' ', <br/>, 'As of November 1995 the total captive population of Ricord‚??s iguana was 5.9 individuals in two collections (Indianapolis Zoo and one private collection).  Successful captive breeding has been achieved in both, but survivorship of young has been low.  The only other significant captive breeding program was developed at the Parque Zoologico Nacional (ZooDom).  Although adversely affected by institutional problems, the program lasted for a number of years with comparable success.  Plans to re-establish the program at ZooDom have been halted since 1994 due to unfavorable institutional conditions\n\n    \n  ']",Decreasing,"

The drop in numbers is probably attributable to a range of threats including habitat loss and poaching by hunters who are trafficking exotic animals (2). Most devastating however has been the introduction of alien species (5). Feral dogs first reported in 1994 are known to kill adult iguanas and predation by an exploding population of feral cats on juveniles is responsible for the deaths of many hatchlings each year (2) (5). The primary threat however comes from competition for food from feral livestock with the island teeming with sheep goats donkeys and cattle that have been released to roam freely across Anegada (2) (4). Grazing pressure from these livestock has radically changed the composition of vegetation available to the iguana shifting the species‚?? diet to rely more on plants with secondary compounds with dubious nutritional value (2).,The Anegada Iguana Recovery Programme began in 1997 which included establishing a ‚??headstart‚?? facility. This facility collects hatchlings and nurtures them in captivity until they can be safely released into the wild with the aim of combating the high rates of juvenile mortality due to cat predation by raising them until they are large enough that predation will not pose as great a threat (6). The first 24 were released into the wild in October 2003 with an 84 percent survival rate and a second group of 24 were released in October 2004 and these are currently being tracked (5). In the 1980s small numbers of these iguanas were removed from Anegada and restored to parts of their former range on Guana Island where the species appears to be doing well in the absence of introduced predators (1) (2). The Guana Island Wildlife Sanctuary continues to try to rid the island of sheep the only feral grazing competitor on the island which may improve the habitat there for the iguanas (1). The species was also later introduced to Necker Island (2). A national park designed to protect this Critically Endangered iguana on Anegada has been approved in principle by the Anegada Lands Committee but rampant debates over land ownership and property boundaries impede developments and must be resolved before this project can progress (2) (4). Further conservation actions advocated include a cat eradication programme and the construction of fences around protected areas to keep livestock out. Indeed despite the successes of the headstart programme it is imperative that efforts are made to control livestock and to secure protected land for the survival of this species. Without prompt action it has been suggested that these iguanas may become extinct on Anegada within the next decade (2). ,loss;poaching;pet; ,protected; ,3,1.0,yes,0

    Hunting for the purposes of traditional ""medicine"" is the primary threat facing this species; most of the populations that survive are heavily reduced and fragmented. Only the subpopulation at Van Long, with about 50 individuals, is thought likely to survive given the current hunting pressure; however, quarrying for limestone (cement), which is currently taking place there, has affected the ranging behaviour of the animals (T. Nadler pers. comm.). The smallest groups are extremely unlikely to survive should the one reproductively active male be taken or killed (Nadler 2004). Forest loss is a more minor threat as it occurs in degraded areas. A potential threat is the rapid development of tourist facilities adjacent to protected areas, especially around Van Long and Hoa Lu Nature Reserves.

    
  ","[""\n    This species is currently listed only as CITES Appendix II. It is considered 'endangered' in Viet Nam, and is listed as a 'most endangered' species under Annex 1B of Decree 32 (2006). It occurs in six protected areas, but many still experience high hunting pressure. Van Long Nature Reserve was established for this species in 2001, and there has been some evidence of population growth in this reserve in the past five years. The connection of forest fragments in some already protected areas, such as Van Long, could greatly increase the size and survivability of some subpopulations. Also considered as beneficial population management for this species are the translocation of severely threatened (small) groups to safe and suitable habitat, and the augmentation of existing groups with offspring from a captive population. Delacour's langurs have been successfully kept and bred in captivity at the Endangered Primate Rescue Center in Cuc Phuong National Park, Viet Nam, which is currently the only collection keeping this species (Nadler 2004).
