The female is similar in appearance to the male, although it has a dark spot on its <strong>dorsal fin</strong> (4).</p></p><h2><img src="/rimg/factsheet/Range.png" class="heading" /></h2><p class="Range"><p>The Comanche Springs pupfish is restricted to a small series of springs and irrigation canals in the Pecos River drainage in Fort Stockton, Toyahvale, and Balmorhea in western Texas in the United States. The extremely small area occupied by this fish is just 10 kilometres squared (5).</p></p><h2><img src="/rimg/factsheet/Habitat.png" class="heading" /></h2><p class="Habitat"><p>The Comanche Springs pupfish inhabits freshwater artesian springs and associated marshes and canals (6). This species is well-adapted to its harsh habitat and can tolerate a large range of salinities (3) and temperatures of up to 40.5 degrees Celsius (7). This species spawns in various sites, ranging from fast-flowing spring outflows to standing water (8).</p></p><h2><img src="/rimg/factsheet/Biology.png" class="heading" /></h2><p class="Biology"><p>The Comanche Springs pupfish can live for up to two years, although most only live for around one year (4). As a result of its short lifespan, this pupfish has no distinct breeding season and is capable of spawning year-round (9).</p><p>The male Comanche Springs pupfish establishes a <strong>territory</strong> which is usually in swift water and will contain an <strong>algal</strong> mat onto which a female can spawn (10). When competing for a mate, the male moves into an upstream position within its <strong>territory</strong> and defends the area until a female arrives (10). Large females produce more eggs than smaller females (11) and the eggs generally hatch after around five days (12). The male fiercely defends the eggs until they hatch (10).</p><p>Although some male Comanche Springs pupfishes maintain a <strong>territory</strong> and will reproduce when a female enters the area, others may use one of two alternative techniques to mate, known as 'satellite positioning' and 'sneak spawning'. Satellite positioning involves an average-sized male occupying the periphery of the <strong>territory</strong> of a larger male and attempting to mate with females when they enter the <strong>territory</strong>. Sneak spawning is used by small males who have a similar appearance to the females. The larger males may not notice that the smaller individual is actually a male, allowing the smaller male to reproduce with the female without being detected and contested by larger conspecifics (13).</p><p>The diet of the Comanche Springs pupfish consists of <strong>algae</strong> and small <strong>invertebrates</strong> (4).</p></p><h2><img src="/rimg/factsheet/Threats.png" class="heading" /></h2><p class="Threats"><p>The small range of the Comanche Springs pupfish means that small changes in the environment can lead to drastic reductions in the overall population size. The main threat to this species is thought to be habitat loss, which is occurring due to excessive groundwater pumping for agriculture (1). The Comanche Spring pupfish has become locally extinct in the spring where it was discovered due to groundwater extraction (1) and excessive water removal is still a problem in the area, as much more water being removed than being replaced by rainfall (3). Other threats to this species include competition and <strong>hybridisation</strong> with non-native species such as the sheepshead minnow (<em>Cyprinodon variegatus</em>) (14). An especially large population of this <strong>invasive</strong> fish lives in Lake Balmorhea, and the upstream dispersal of this population is proving to be detrimental to the Comanche Springs pupfish (15).</p></p><h2><img src="/rimg/factsheet/Conservation.png" class="heading" /></h2><p class="Conservation"><p>Current conservation efforts for this species are focussed on moderating water level fluctuations and removing <strong>invasive</strong> species (1). A man-made refugium and cienega were constructed in Balmorhea State Park in 1996 in an attempt to provide the Comanche Springs pupfish with a habitat that is not at risk of being drained (15). This wetland area has been located within the boundaries of the natural cienega in an effort to make it resemble and function similarly to the original habitat of this species (16). This conservation measure has proved to be a success and the area is now home to the worldâ€™s largest Comanche Springs pupfish population. Additionally, it is hoped that the removal of the <strong>invasive</strong> sheepshead minnow will help the Comanche Springs pupfish population to recover by eliminating unnatural competition (17).</p><p>The Comanche Springs pupfish was federally listed as endangered in the United States in 1967 (4).</p></p><h2><img src="/rimg/factsheet/FurtherInformation.png" class="heading" /></h2><p class="Find out more"><p>Find out more about the Comanche Springs pupfish:</p><ul><li>U.S. Fish &amp; Wildlife Service - Comanche Springs Pupfish Species Information: <br/><a href="http://www.fws.gov/Southwest/fisheries/documents/species/Comanche_Springs_Pupfish.pdf" target="_blank">http://www.fws.gov/Southwest/fisheries/documents/species/Comanche_Springs_Pupfish.pdf</a></li></ul></p><h2><img src="/rimg/factsheet/Authentication.png" class="heading" /></h2><p class="AuthenticatioModel"><p>This information is awaiting authentication by a species expert, and will be updated as soon as possible.

<li><strong>Algae: </strong>simple plants that lack roots, stems and leaves but contain the green pigment chlorophyll. Most occur in marine and freshwater habitats.</li>
<li><strong>Dorsal fin: </strong>the unpaired fin found on the back of the body of fish, or the raised structure on the back of most cetaceans (whales, dolphins and porpoises).</li>
<li><strong>Hybridisation: </strong>cross-breeding between two different species or subspecies.</li>
<li><strong>Invasive: </strong>describes species introduced deliberately or unintentionally outside their natural habitats where they have the ability to establish themselves, invade, outcompete natives and take over the new environments.</li>
<li><strong>Invertebrates: </strong>animals with no backbone, such as insects, crustaceans, worms, molluscs, spiders, cnidarians (jellyfish, corals, sea anemones) and echinoderms.</li>
<li><strong>Territorial: </strong>describes an animal, a pair of animals or a group that occupies and defends an area.</li>
