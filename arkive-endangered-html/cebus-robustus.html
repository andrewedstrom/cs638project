        <h2><img src="/rimg/factsheet/Status.png" class="heading" /></h2><p class="Status"><p>The crested capuchin is listed as Endangered (EN) on the IUCN Red List (1), and listed on Appendix II of CITES (3).</p></p><h2><img src="/rimg/factsheet/Description.png" class="heading" /></h2><p class="Description"><p>The crested capuchin (<em>Cebus robustus</em>), also known as the robust tufted capuchin, is recognisable by a conical crest which forms a peak on the crown of the head (2). The crest itself is very dark in colour and the black fur extends around the capuchin’s face to form a dense ‘beard’ under the chin. The lower parts of the arms, legs and tail are also black, while the rest of the body is covered in rich reddish-brown fur (2).</p>
<p>The male crested capuchin has a relatively well developed <strong>sagittal crest</strong>, a bony ridge along the top of the skull, and has darker fur than the female. The male is also slightly larger than the female, but the sexes are similar in other aspects (2).</p></p><h2><img src="/rimg/factsheet/Range.png" class="heading" /></h2><p class="Range"><p>The crested capuchin is <strong>endemic</strong> to Brazil, where it inhabits an area stretching from southern Bahia to northern Espírito Santo and then further west to Minas Gerais (1).</p></p><h2><img src="/rimg/factsheet/Habitat.png" class="heading" /></h2><p class="Habitat"><p>Found in the <strong>Atlantic forest</strong> of eastern Brazil, the crested capuchin inhabits both tropical lowland and <strong>submontane forest</strong>. It has also been recorded in dry <strong>semi-deciduous</strong> forest in the west of its range. This species particularly favours the lower to middle parts of the forest canopy (1).</p></p><h2><img src="/rimg/factsheet/Biology.png" class="heading" /></h2><p class="Biology"><p>The crested capuchin is an <strong>arboreal</strong> monkey and spends most of its life foraging in the forest understorey. Like other capuchins, the crested capuchin is particularly partial to fruits, but will also eat other plant parts as well as insects, frogs and even small mammals (1).</p>
<p>Capuchin monkeys (<em>Cebus </em>spp.) are known for their ability to manipulate objects and food. They are intelligent, social animals and the crested capuchin is no exception. The crested capuchin is a manipulative forager, capable of using its cognitive abilities and highly dexterous hands to prepare food items (4). As in other capuchins, this could include using a rock to break open a tough nut or hard-shelled <strong>mollusc</strong>. The advanced foraging skills of capuchins allow them to exploit food sources that are inaccessible to other primates (5).</p>
<p>Very little is known about the behaviour of the crested capuchin. However, capuchin species usually live in groups, with each group known to have a structured hierarchical system with a dominant male at the head of the troop and a dominant female subordinate to that male. Lower ranking males usually stay peripheral to the main troop (1).</p>
<p>Capuchins generally have long lifespans of up to 55 years, and slow reproductive cycles. When born, the infant is highly dependent on its mother and will not reach sexual maturity until about five years of age (6).</p></p><h2><img src="/rimg/factsheet/Threats.png" class="heading" /></h2><p class="Threats"><p>The main threat that the crested capuchin faces is the fragmentation and destruction of its natural forest habitat. Economic demand for coffee, eucalyptus, pine plantations, cattle and agricultural crops is high, which results in forest clearing (1). As a result,only around nine percent of the original <strong>Atlantic rainforest</strong> remains undamaged in Brazil (7).</p>
<p>The crested capuchin is also hunted by locals. As a direct result of these threats the crested capuchin population is rapidly decreasing (1).</p></p><h2><img src="/rimg/factsheet/Conservation.png" class="heading" /></h2><p class="Conservation"><p>There are several protected areas within the range of the crested capuchin, such as the Linhares Forest Reserve in Espírito Santo and the State Biological Reserve Mata dos Ausentes in Minas Gerais (1). The crested capuchin is also listed on Appendix II of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES), which means trade in this species should be closely monitored (3).</p>
<p>The Committee for the Atlantic forest capuchin monkeys, <em>Cebus xanthosternos </em>and <em>Cebus robustus</em>, was created in 1992 with the aim of protecting and conserving these two species. Then, in 2004, the committee took in a working group for two more species, the Barbara Brown’s titi monkey (<em>Callicebus barbarabrownae</em>) and Coimbra-Filho’s titi monkey (<em>Callicebus coimbrai</em>). Since then it has been working hard to outline the appropriate emergency steps needed to save these species (8).</p></p><h2><img src="/rimg/factsheet/FurtherInformation.png" class="heading" /></h2><p class="Find out more"><p>More information on primate conservation:</p>
