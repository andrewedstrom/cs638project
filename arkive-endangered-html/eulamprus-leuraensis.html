        <h2><img src="/rimg/factsheet/Status.png" class="heading" /></h2><p class="Status"><p>Classified as Endangered (EN) on the IUCN Red List (1).</p></p><h2><img src="/rimg/factsheet/Description.png" class="heading" /></h2><p class="Description"><p>The little-known Blue Mountains water skink is one of Australia’s rarest lizards. Elongated and flattened, the mid-body of this attractive lizard is adorned with around 30 rows of tightly arranged, smooth scales that shine with an iridescence in the sunlight (3). Two distinctive yellow-bronze stripes stretch from the head, down the length of the body, to the base of the long, slender tail, and fade into a scattering of spots.&nbsp;Much darker than related species, the body is brown to black in colour, with a brown-bronze head, and a golden underside that contrasts with small flecks of brown. The short, powerful limbs are also dark coloured, with bronze streaks, and possess five, well-developed digits (4).</p></p><h2><img src="/rimg/factsheet/Range.png" class="heading" /></h2><p class="Range"><p>The Blue Mountains water skink is <strong>endemic</strong> to south-east Australia, where it is restricted to the Blue Mountains and Newnes Plateau, New South Wales. It is known to occur in 30 fragmented locations; however, substantial areas of suitable habitat have not yet been surveyed, and it is possible that new populations may be found at the Boyd Plateau, south of Jenolan Caves, the Lithgow Valley and south of Sydney. Aerial surveys have also discovered that the species’ range may extend a further 10 kilometers south, and one kilometer east, from its most south-eastern point, as large areas of suitable habitat remain (2).</p></p><h2><img src="/rimg/factsheet/Habitat.png" class="heading" /></h2><p class="Habitat"><p>The Blue Mountains water skink inhabits moderate and high elevation shrub and ‘hanging’ sedge swamps, a unique and rare habitat in Australia, on sandy-peaty soils, from 560 metres above sea level, upwards (4).&nbsp;It may also be found in open forest, scrub, tussock grassland and heath, on sandstone or Narrabeen soils, with a constant supply of water (2) (5).&nbsp;The Blue Mountains water skink prefers large, well connected swamps, with a deep litter layer and moist soils, but is most abundant in areas dominated by the two plant species <em>Tetrarrhena turfosa </em>and <em>Baeckea linifolia</em> (2).</p></p><h2><img src="/rimg/factsheet/Biology.png" class="heading" /></h2><p class="Biology"><p>A semi-aquatic, <strong>diurnal</strong> predator, the Blue Mountains water skink seeks out its prey amongst the vegetation of swamp margins.&nbsp;It is largely <strong>insectivorous</strong>, consuming a variety of <strong>arthropods</strong>, such as grasshoppers and moths, but will occasionally supplement its diet with plant material and fruits. The Blue Mountains water skink is most active on sunny days, between September and late April, and is thought to enter a state of torpor over the winter months, possibly residing in a burrow or nest of dense vegetation (4). The dark coloration of the Blue Mountains water skink can make it highly conspicuous, and if detected by a predator it may flee into a dense grass tussock or down a burrow.&nbsp;It will occasionally use the burrow of other species such as the giant burrowing frog (<em>Heleioporus australiacus</em>), which may also serve to protect it from natural fires (4).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The capture of male specimens with swollen <strong>testes</strong> in September and October suggests that the Blue Mountains water skink breeds during this period (2). Males attract a mate using a courtship display of head bobbing and lateral body movements, and will compete aggressively with other males, often in combat, for the females’ attention (6). The Blue Mountains water skin is <strong>ovoviviparous</strong>, meaning that the egg develops and hatches inside the female, with live young born in late December.&nbsp;Basking sites are likely to be important to <strong>gravid</strong> females, as direct sunlight is required to maintain the body temperature of the developing young (2).&nbsp;</p></p><h2><img src="/rimg/factsheet/Threats.png" class="heading" /></h2><p class="Threats"><p>Restricted to a very specific habitat, dependant on delicate associations between the fauna and flora and the water hydrology, the Blue Mountains water skink has probably never been abundant.&nbsp;However, as a result of an increasing human population encroaching upon its habitat, it has become threatened, and today, has a very small population (1) (2).&nbsp;Relict populations are extremely isolated and fragmented and, therefore, highly vulnerable to habitat degradation, especially as the majority of Blue Mountains water skink populations are surrounded by urban development (2). Pollution from rubbish disposal, commercial run-off and septic discharge is a particular problem at several locations, and can lead to nitrification, promoting weed infestations.&nbsp;Earthworks for the establishment of sewage pipelines and poor erosion control mechanisms, has also resulted in sedimentation, causing swamps to dry up.&nbsp;Furthermore, the Blue Mountains water skink’s range is intersected by corridors of powerlines, and their servicing has been identified as an additional threat, through the slashing, burning and spraying of pesticides that is required to gain maintenance access (4).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Predation by feral and domestic cats poses further problems, as these introduced predators, which arrived in Australia in the 18<sup>th</sup>century, are now widespread, and threaten many rare species (7).&nbsp;Similarly, pigs have also been introduced into vast areas of Australia, and threaten Blue Mountain water skink habitat by digging up the soils, and altering the composition of the vegetation (8). &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></p><h2><img src="/rimg/factsheet/Conservation.png" class="heading" /></h2><p class="Conservation"><p>With high levels of <strong>endemism</strong>, and large numbers of threatened species, the Blue Mountains, home to the Blue Mountains water skink, is a region of major conservation importance.&nbsp;Recognising this, the Australian government has afforded this region extra protection, beginning in 1959, with the creation of the Blue Mountains National Park, and most recently, the creation of the UNESCO Greater Blue Mountains World Heritage Area in 2000 (9) (10).&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Blue Mountains water skink is recognised as a threatened species of national environmental significance, and a series of priority actions, required to ensure its survival, are detailed in a thorough recovery plan (4) (11) (12). Ameliorating the impact of invasive weeds, through improved management of urban wastes, and the control of feral cats and pigs, through shooting, trapping and fencing is deemed a high priority (7) (8) (11). Further research is also required to assess the species’ response to various threats, and to investigate the species’ ecological requirements, so that further areas of suitable habitat can be identified (11). The development of a conservation breeding programme has also been planned, which will aim to maintain the species’ genetic diversity, and introduce captive-bred individuals into locations within its known range (5).&nbsp;This will be complemented by a community awareness project that will seek public support for the conservation programme, increase community involvement in recovery operations, and development land management guidelines for landowners and users (2) (5).</p></p><h2><img src="/rimg/factsheet/FurtherInformation.png" class="heading" /></h2><p class="Find out more"><p>For more information on the conservation of the Blue Mountains, see:</p>
