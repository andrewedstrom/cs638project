        <h2><img src="/rimg/factsheet/Status.png" class="heading" /></h2><p class="Status"><p>Edmund’s snaketail is classified as Endangered (EN) on the IUCN Red List (1).</p></p><h2><img src="/rimg/factsheet/Description.png" class="heading" /></h2><p class="Description"><p>Edmund’s snaketail (<em>Ophiogomphus edmundo</em>) is a beautifully patterned, slender dragonfly, distinctly striped with brown on the <strong>thorax</strong>. The body is greenish, and the <strong>abdomen</strong> is smooth and blackish, becoming paler and hairy on the underside. Edmund’s snaketail has a well-defined brown stripe running lengthways down the centre of the <strong>thorax</strong>, separated in the middle by a yellow ridge. A broad yellowish stripe covers the first two segments of the <strong>abdomen</strong> and narrows to a line on the third segment. A broad, broken stripe is visible on the rest of the <strong>abdomen</strong>, except for the ninth segment which has a round spot. The last segment of the <strong>abdomen</strong> is mostly yellow (2).</p>
<p>This species has a pale greenish to yellowish-green face, with a narrow line of pale cinnamon-brown on the upper lip of the mouthparts. The top of the head is black, and Edmund’s snaketail has a pair of black <strong>antennae</strong> which have a narrow ring of white around the stout base. The back of the head is yellowish and fringed with a crest of long, blackish hairs. Edmund’s snaketail has pale lower legs, which turn darker towards the knees and black on the upper parts of leg (2).</p>
<p>The female Edmund’s dragonfly is very similar to the male, but the wide central stripe on the <strong>thorax</strong> is less clearly divided by the yellow ridge. The female also has a very small pair of black horns on the sides of the head which appear blunt and crumpled (2).&nbsp;</p></p><h2><img src="/rimg/factsheet/Range.png" class="heading" /></h2><p class="Range"><p>Occurring in just three states in the United States, Edmund’s snaketail has a relatively restricted distribution. It is known only from the Conasauga River in Tennessee and Georgia, from two locations in the Catawba drainage in North Carolina, and from a tributary of the Chattahoochee River in north Georgia (1) (3) (4) (5). &nbsp;</p></p><h2><img src="/rimg/factsheet/Habitat.png" class="heading" /></h2><p class="Habitat"><p>Edmund’s snaketail typically inhabits clear, moderately flowing mountain streams (1) (3) (5), with a sand or gravel substrate (4) (6). The adults often fly over shallow <strong>riffles</strong> or perch on rocks (3) (4).&nbsp;</p>
<p>Away from water, Edmund’s snaketail perches on the ground or in vegetation, including bushes, branches, or tree canopies, in open woods (6).</p></p><h2><img src="/rimg/factsheet/Biology.png" class="heading" /></h2><p class="Biology"><p>Very little specific information is available about the biology of Edmund’s snaketail, although it is presumed to spend much of its time among trees and patches of vegetation. The <strong>larvae</strong> of this species have been recorded in highly oxygenated <strong>riffles</strong> (3).</p>
<p>Dragonfly <strong>larvae</strong> are highly mobile aquatic predators, feeding on a wide variety of aquatic prey, including minute <strong>crustaceans</strong> and other <strong>invertebrates</strong>. The <strong>larvae</strong> stalk their prey, locating it mainly by sight. Once it is close enough, they catch their prey by shooting out their lower jaw, using pressure that has built up in the muscles (7) (8). The lower jaw, called the labium, has hinged hooks which grasp the prey and drag it back to the mouth as the jaw retracts (7).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The length of the <strong>larval</strong> stage varies between species, although it may range from a few weeks to several years. During this time, the <strong>larvae</strong> undergo a series of <strong>moults</strong>, passing through several developmental stages known as instars or stadia (7) (8). Shortly before the final <strong>moult</strong>, the dragonfly <strong>larvae</strong> stop feeding and move to sites where they can emerge, usually in vegetation. The <strong>larvae</strong> emerge from their final <strong>moult</strong> having <strong>metamorphosed</strong> into adult dragonflies, with characteristic features such as wings and enlarged compound eyes (7). The wings of the newly emerged adult rapidly expand and harden, with the first flight occurring soon after the final <strong>moult</strong> (7) (8). The new dragonflies then leave the water, spending anything from a few days to several weeks feeding and maturing (7).</p>
<p>Adult dragonflies are agile, opportunistic predators with exceptional eyesight, preying on a wide variety of flying insects. Following the maturation period, adult male dragonflies return to the water, with many species setting up <strong>territories</strong> which are aggressively defended against other males. Female dragonflies typically only return to water to mate (7) (8).</p>
<p>Mating dragonflies adopt a characteristic ‘wheel’ position, with the male grasping the female by the head using claspers on the end of the <strong>abdomen</strong>, while the female bends the tip of her <strong>abdomen</strong> forward to reach the male genitalia on the second and third segments of the male’s <strong>abdomen</strong> (7) (8). The female typically lays eggs almost immediately after mating, and is often guarded by the male (7).</p></p><h2><img src="/rimg/factsheet/Threats.png" class="heading" /></h2><p class="Threats"><p>Edmund’s snaketail is threatened by the impounding and channelling of water to develop dams and reservoirs for hydroelectric schemes, irrigation and water supplies. Siltation, drainage and pollution also pose further threats to this species as they destroy freshwater habitats by lowering the water table, sometimes turning permanent waterbodies into temporary water sources (1) (3) (8).</p>
<p>Pollution from sewerage and industrial waste, fertiliser run-off and pesticide drift have wiped out or greatly reduced the populations of many species of dragonfly, and is likely to similarly affect the population of Edmund’s snaketail (8).</p></p><h2><img src="/rimg/factsheet/Conservation.png" class="heading" /></h2><p class="Conservation"><p>The Conasauga River runs through fairly rugged, inaccessible country in national forests in Tennessee and Georgia, which affords some level of protection to Edmund’s snaketail in these areas. It is also state-listed in Georgia (1).</p>
<p>The IUCN/SSC Odonata Specialist Group has identified key priorities for dragonfly conservation as establishing Protected Areas, such as National Parks and nature reserves, as well as ensuring that activities in existing protected areas are managed appropriately. Additionally, the IUCN/SSC Odonata Specialist Group recognises the need to conserve habitats outside Protected Areas by modifying agricultural, forestry and industrial practices (8).</p>
<p>To effectively conserve dragonfly populations, the IUCN/SSC Odonata Specialist Group has outlined a number of measures, including research into the <strong>taxonomy</strong>, distributions and biological requirements of dragonfly species, and controlling pollution at key dragonfly sites. It also recommends amending legislation to provide protected areas and control development and pollution, as well as carrying out educational campaigns to raise public awareness (8).</p></p><h2><img src="/rimg/factsheet/FurtherInformation.png" class="heading" /></h2><p class="Find out more"><p>Find out more about dragonfly conservation:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Abdomen: </strong>in arthropods (crustaceans, insects and arachnids) the abdomen is the hind region of the body, which is usually segmented to a degree (but not visibly in most spiders).</li>
<li><strong>Antennae: </strong>pair of sensory structures on the head of invertebrates. </li>
<li><strong>Crustaceans: </strong>diverse group of arthropods (a phylum of animals with jointed limbs and a hard chitinous exoskeleton) characterised by the possession of two pairs of antennae, one pair of mandibles (mouthparts used for handling and processing food) and two pairs of maxillae (appendages used in eating, which are located behind the mandibles). Includes crabs, lobsters, shrimps, woodlice and barnacles.</li>
<li><strong>Invertebrates: </strong>animals with no backbone, such as insects, crustaceans, worms, molluscs, spiders, cnidarians (jellyfish, corals, sea anemones), echinoderms, and others.</li>
<li><strong>Larvae: </strong>stage in an animal’s lifecycle after it hatches from the egg. Larvae are typically very different in appearance to adults; they are able to feed and move around but usually are unable to reproduce.</li>
<li><strong>Metamorphosis: </strong>an abrupt physical change from the larval to the adult form.</li>
<li><strong>Moults: </strong>in insects, referring to stages of growth, whereby the hard outer layer of the body (the exoskeleton) is shed and the body becomes larger.  </li>
<li><strong>Riffles: </strong>light rapids where water flows across a shallow section of river.</li>
<li><strong>Taxonomy: </strong>the science of classifying organisms, grouping together animals which share common features and are thought to have a common ancestor.</li>
<li><strong>Territory: </strong>an area occupied and defended by an animal, a pair of animals or a colony.</li>
<li><strong>Thorax: </strong>part of the body located near the head in animals. In insects, the three segments between the head and the abdomen, each of which has a pair of legs. In vertebrates the thorax contains the heart and the lungs.</li>
