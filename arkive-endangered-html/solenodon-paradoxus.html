<p>The Hispaniolan solenodon is also an opportunistic scavenger and may prey on amphibians, reptiles and small birds if or when the opportunity arises.&nbsp; Indeed, local people believe it to eat snakes and chickens (5), and such remains have been found in solenodon faeces, although this may be the result of scavenging dead animals (2).&nbsp; It lunges at its chosen prey, pinning it down with its strong forelimbs, and then scoops up the prey with its lower jaw.&nbsp; A bite from the solenodon injects the victim with toxic saliva from its lower incisors and renders the prey immobile (2).&nbsp; Potential animal predators of the Hispaniolan solenondon include boas and birds of prey (namely owls) (2) (7).</p>
<p>Solenodons have a long life span, possibly around 11 years, and a low reproductive rate.&nbsp; The female gives birth to one or two young in a burrow (2), which can be an extensive system of tunnels in which they forage and nest (3).&nbsp; During the first two months of life the young remain close to their mother and may accompany her on foraging excursions, hanging on to her elongated teats by their mouth (2). &nbsp;</p></p><h2><img src="/rimg/factsheet/Threats.png" class="heading" /></h2><p class="Threats"><p>Out of approximately 25 <strong>endemic</strong> land (non-flying) mammal species that once inhabited Hispaniola only two survive to this day: the solenodon and hutia (3) (7).&nbsp; Before Europeans arrived on the island, the Hispaniolan solenodon was one of the dominant <strong>carnivores</strong> on Hispaniola (1) (2), despite some evidence that suggests that the original occupants of Hispaniola (Amerindians) hunted this species for food (3) (7).&nbsp; Today, however, the solenodon is thought to be threatened by predation from introduced cats, dogs and mongooses brought to the island with the arrival of the Europeans (1) (2).&nbsp; Even back in 1907, when a Mr Verill attempted to find the solenodon in the Dominican Republic, he attributed its restricted range to the presence of the mongoose, and felt that it was only a question of time before the mongoose would cause the solenodon’s extinction (5).&nbsp; The destruction of forests on the island also poses a significant threat to the solenodon, an animal which is particularly vulnerable to any negative impact due to its low reproductive rate (1) (2).&nbsp;</p></p><h2><img src="/rimg/factsheet/Conservation.png" class="heading" /></h2><p class="Conservation"><p>There is thought to be little hope for this species in Haiti (2), but in the Dominican Republic, the Hispaniolan solenodon is known to occur in several areas (6).&nbsp; These areas still face threats from logging, agriculture and cattle ranching; however, both international conservation organisations (for example, The Nature Conservancy and Durrell Wildlife Conservation Trust) and national conservation organisations (for example, Sociedad Ornitologica de la Hispaniola and Grupo Jaragua) are working to address these threats and implement management plans for protected areas (6). &nbsp;The focus of efforts should be to conserve this species in protected forest reserves; however, the enormous pressure from increasing human populations on Hispaniola may mean that the survival of the Hispaniolan solenodon ultimately depends on zoos (2), although, as yet, captive breeding of this unique mammal has not been successful (7).</p></p><h2><img src="/rimg/factsheet/FurtherInformation.png" class="heading" /></h2><p class="Find out more"><p>For further information on the Hispaniolan solenodon and its conservation see:</p>
