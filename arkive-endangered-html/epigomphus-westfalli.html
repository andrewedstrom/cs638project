Like other members of this distinctive family, this species possesses green to yellow colouration with black stripes, and small, widely separated eyes (2).</p></p><h2><img src="/rimg/factsheet/Range.png" class="heading" /></h2><p class="Range"><p><strong>Endemic</strong> to Nicaragua (1).</p></p><h2><img src="/rimg/factsheet/Habitat.png" class="heading" /></h2><p class="Habitat"><p>Found in and around lowland to montane rain-forest streams, at between 700 and 1,250 m above sea level (1).</p></p><h2><img src="/rimg/factsheet/Biology.png" class="heading" /></h2><p class="Biology"><p>Virtually nothing has been recorded of Westfall’s knobtail’s social, reproductive or feeding behaviour, but certain details can be inferred from what is known about damselflies and dragonflies (Odonata) generally. Odonata species start their life as aquatic <strong>larvae</strong> or nymphs, passing through a series of developmental stages or ‘stadia', and undergoing several moults as they grow. This larval period can last anything between three months and ten years, depending upon the species. Before the final moult (emergence), <strong>metamorphosis</strong> occurs in which the larvae transform into the adult form. After emergence, adults undergo a pre-reproductive phase known as the maturation period, when individuals normally develop their full adult colour (3).</p><p>There is often fierce competition between male dragonflies and damselflies for access to reproductive females, and mature males normally establish territories at choice breeding sites along a stretch of river. Females typically begin to lay eggs in water immediately after copulation, often guarded by their mate. However, females of some species can store live sperm in their body for a number of days (3).</p><p>Odonata usually feed on flying insects and are generalised, opportunistic feeders, often congregating around abundant prey sources such as swarms of termites or near beehives (3).</p></p><h2><img src="/rimg/factsheet/Threats.png" class="heading" /></h2><p class="Threats"><p>Westfall’s knobtail is known from only two locations, and much of its known range has been deforested, with ongoing habitat loss posing a serious threat to the species (1).</p></p><h2><img src="/rimg/factsheet/Conservation.png" class="heading" /></h2><p class="Conservation"><p>There are currently no known conservation measures targeting this species, but there is an urgent need to search for other subpopulations and to determine the extent of suitable habitat remaining in the general area (1).</p></p><h2><img src="/rimg/factsheet/Authentication.png" class="heading" /></h2><p class="AuthenticatioModel">This information is awaiting authentication by a species expert, and will be updated as soon as possible.

<ul>
<li><strong>Endemic: </strong>a species or taxonomic group that is only found in one particular country or geographic area.</li>
<li><strong>Larvae: </strong>Stage in an animal's lifecycle after it hatches from the egg. Larvae are typically very different in appearance to adults; they are able to feed and move around but usually are unable to reproduce.</li>
<li><strong>Metamorphosis: </strong>An abrupt physical change from the larval to the adult form.</li>
