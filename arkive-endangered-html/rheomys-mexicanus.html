        <h2><img src="/rimg/factsheet/Status.png" class="heading" /></h2><p class="Status"><p>Classified as Endangered (EN) on the IUCN Red List (1).</p></p><h2><img src="/rimg/factsheet/Description.png" class="heading" /></h2><p class="Description"><p>With its streamlined body, small, almost inconspicuous ears, and large, paddle-shaped hind feet, the Mexican water mouse is well adapted to its semi-aquatic lifestyle. The hind feet are also partially webbed and are fringed with hair, giving extra propulsion in the water, and the long, furred tail, which is longer than the length of the head and body, may also aid in swimming (2) (4) (5) (6). The short, dense, glossy fur is dark brown on the upperparts, often with a few longer, silvery outer hairs, and silvery white on the underparts, while the tail is also dark above and white below. The muzzle is quite blunt, with thin, stiff whiskers, and the eyes are tiny. Juveniles are reported to be slate grey in colour (4).</p>
<p>The Mexican water mouse is very similar in appearance to crab-eating rats of the <strong>genus</strong> <i>Ichthyomys</i>, but can be distinguished by its smaller size and by having four rather than five pads on the palm of the forefoot (2) (4) (5) (6).</p></p><h2><img src="/rimg/factsheet/Range.png" class="heading" /></h2><p class="Range"><p>The Mexican water mouse is <strong>endemic</strong> to the state of Oaxaca, Mexico, where it is known from only four sites (1) (2) (3) (4).</p></p><h2><img src="/rimg/factsheet/Habitat.png" class="heading" /></h2><p class="Habitat"><p>This semi-aquatic rodent inhabits tropical montane forest at the headwaters of freshwater streams, where it is restricted to small tributaries that are shaded by vegetation, and avoids larger rivers (1) (2) (4) (6). It has been recorded, for example, in pine-oak forest at elevations of around 2,000 metres (3), and appears to require pristine, non-polluted habitat (1).</p></p><h2><img src="/rimg/factsheet/Biology.png" class="heading" /></h2><p class="Biology"><p>Very little is known about the biology of the Mexican water mouse. Like other members of the <strong>genus</strong>, it has a semi-aquatic lifestyle, foraging for a range of aquatic insects, insect <strong>larvae</strong>, snails and other aquatic <strong>invertebrates</strong>, and possibly even small fish (2) (4) (6) (7). Other species have been observed to swim with only the head and the tip of the tail protruding above the water, and with the hind feet used for propulsion (5). Nothing is known about the reproductive behaviour of these rodents.</p></p><h2><img src="/rimg/factsheet/Threats.png" class="heading" /></h2><p class="Threats"><p>In general, water mice are considered very difficult to capture, and so the exact status of many species is unknown (4) (5). However, the Mexican water mouse is believed to be rare and to occupy a limited and severely fragmented range, and has been recorded from only four locations, making it particularly vulnerable (1) (2). The main threats to the species are deforestation, which is reported to be occurring throughout its range, and water pollution. The Mexican water mouse is reliant on areas of pristine habitat, and any kind of water pollution, including household pollution from the washing of clothes, is a potential threat to its survival (1).</p></p><h2><img src="/rimg/factsheet/Conservation.png" class="heading" /></h2><p class="Conservation"><p>The Mexican water mouse is classed as ‘Rare’ by the Mexican government (8), but there are not known to be any specific conservation measures in place for the species. More research is needed to better understand this little-known rodent, and to determine the status of its populations and its specialised habitat, before appropriate conservation measures can be put in place (1).</p></p><h2><img src="/rimg/factsheet/FurtherInformation.png" class="heading" /></h2><p class="Find out more"><p>To find out more about the Mexican water mouse see:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Endemic: </strong>a species or taxonomic group that is only found in one particular country or geographic area.</li>
<li><strong>Genus: </strong>a category used in taxonomy, which is below ‘family’ and above ‘species’. A genus tends to contain species that have characteristics in common. The genus forms the first part of a ‘binomial’ Latin species name; the second part is the specific name.</li>
<li><strong>Invertebrates: </strong>animals with no backbone, such as insects, crustaceans, worms, molluscs, spiders, cnidarians (jellyfish, corals, sea anemones), echinoderms, and others.</li>
<li><strong>Larvae: </strong>stage in an animal’s lifecycle after it hatches from the egg. Larvae are typically very different in appearance to adults; they are able to feed and move around but usually are unable to reproduce.</li>
