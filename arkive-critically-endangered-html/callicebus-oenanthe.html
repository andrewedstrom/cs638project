Its non-<strong>prehensile</strong> tail is roughly the same length as the body (2) and is covered in thick, soft hair (5).</p>
<p>The body of the San Martin titi monkey is covered in thick, light brown agouti fur, with orange fur on the belly, chest and inner surfaces of the limbs. Agouti colouration is characterised by hairs having multiple bands of colour, giving a somewhat ‘peppered’ or grizzled appearance. The San Martin titi monkey is also characterised by a white to buffy blaze on its face, extending up to the top of the head, and there are dark patches around the eyes (2) (6) (7).</p></p><h2><img src="/rimg/factsheet/Range.png" class="heading" /></h2><p class="Range"><p>The San Martin titi monkey is <strong>endemic</strong> to the upper Rio Mayo valley and adjacent areas in north-central Peru (1) (5) (8). This species was previously believed to occur only in the upper Rio Mayo valley, but recent studies have found that its range also extends further south into the Bajo Mayo and Huallaga Central (8).</p></p><h2><img src="/rimg/factsheet/Habitat.png" class="heading" /></h2><p class="Habitat"><p>The San Martin titi monkey has been recorded in a range of forest habitats, including <strong>secondary forest</strong>, bamboo stands, fruit crops, vine thickets and palm-dominated forest (7) (9). It appears to be most frequently found near streams and rivers, often occurring in flooded and seasonally flooded forests (1) (10). However, it has also been recorded in drier areas (8).</p></p><h2><img src="/rimg/factsheet/Biology.png" class="heading" /></h2><p class="Biology"><p>An <strong>arboreal</strong> species (5), the San Martin titi monkey usually occupies the dense understory of the forest (11). This species is active during the day, tending to feed in the early morning and resting around midday. Moving in social family groups, it forages for food and selects sleeping sites during the early to late evening (5). Like other titi monkeys (<em>Callicebus</em> species), the San Martin titi monkey moves around on all fours and rests in a characteristic huddled position, with all four limbs brought together on the branch and the tail hanging down (5).</p>
<p>The diet of the San Martin titi monkey consists mainly of fruit and insects, although it also feeds on seeds, flowers, leaves and other plant parts (7) (9) (11). In comparison with other titi monkeys, insects make up a considerable portion of the San Martin titi monkey’s diet, particularly when other foods are scarce (7) (11).</p>
<p>The San Martin titi monkey is <strong>monogamous</strong>, living in a family group of around two to six, consisting of a strongly bonded adult pair and their young. The adult male leads the group in their foraging movements and often carries an infant when it is not nursing from the female (5). The adult male and female are <strong>territorial</strong> and defend their <strong>territory</strong> with loud vocalisations and aggression towards other individuals (3) (8).</p>
<p>Like other titi monkeys, the San Martin titi monkey is likely to give birth to one infant a year, after a <strong>gestation</strong> period of about five to six months (3) (5). Group members are very social and affectionate with one another and are frequently seen intertwining tails when they are sitting near to each other (5).</p></p><h2><img src="/rimg/factsheet/Threats.png" class="heading" /></h2><p class="Threats"><p>The main threat to the San Martin titi monkey is massive deforestation and habitat fragmentation within its restricted range. As a result, its population is estimated to have declined by over 80 percent in the past 25 years (1). The forests that this monkey inhabits are being torn down for timber, firewood and to cultivate rice, coffee and other crops, and titi groups are becoming increasingly isolated in the remaining forest fragments (1) (7) (10).</p>
<p>Deforestation in the region has been exacerbated by high levels of immigration and the construction of a major paved highway. The influx of immigrants has also resulted in a change from traditional subsistence and small-scale farming (1) (7) (10).</p>
<p>A further threat to the San Martin titi monkey comes from hunting for its meat (1) (7) (8) (10). Although not usually targeted by hunters, this species is likely to be taken when other game species become scarce and as habitat fragmentation increases access to the forest (1) (10). It is also commonly captured for the local pet trade (1) (7) (8) (10).</p></p><h2><img src="/rimg/factsheet/Conservation.png" class="heading" /></h2><p class="Conservation"><p>International trade in the San Martin titi monkey should be carefully regulated under this species’ listing on Appendix II of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) (4).</p>
<p>Unfortunately, little attention has so far been given to forest conservation within the San Martin titi monkey’s range (1) (10). The Department of San Martín has 13 municipal protected areas, but most are poorly demarcated and routinely invaded by immigrants (10). However, the San Martin titi monkey may occur on some reserves, including Pabloyacu (10) and the Bosque de Protección de Alto Mayo (1).</p>
<p>Outside of protected areas, the indigenous Aguaruna community will play an important role in the protection of the San Martin titi monkey as it occupies large tracts of remaining forest. However, much of this land is rented to farmers for the production of rice, papaya and coffee (10).</p>
<p>Recommended conservation strategies for the protection of isolated titi monkey populations include surveying all possible habitats (1) (7) (10) and working with landowners to protect the San Martin titi monkey on their land (10). It will also be important to regulate new and existing farming settlements and to provide forest corridors to reconnect isolated titi monkey groups (7).</p>
<p>In 2007, the Proyecto Mono Tocón was set up with the aim of conserving the San Martin titi monkey and its habitat. This project works directly with local people, governments and other organisations to perform conservation, research and environmental education activities and to establish community conservation areas (1) (12). It is also investigating the possibility of creating a protected area in forest near Moyobamba, specifically to help conserve this highly threatened primate (12).</p></p><h2><img src="/rimg/factsheet/FurtherInformation.png" class="heading" /></h2><p class="Find out more"><p>Find out more about the San Martin titi monkey and its conservation:</p>
