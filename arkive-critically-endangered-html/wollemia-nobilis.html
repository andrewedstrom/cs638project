        <h2><img src="/rimg/factsheet/Status.png" class="heading" /></h2><p class="Status"><p>Classified as Critically Endangered (CR - D) on the IUCN Red List 2002 (1).</p></p><h2><img src="/rimg/factsheet/Description.png" class="heading" /></h2><p class="Description"><p>The Wollemi pine has been dubbed a 'living fossil' as it represents the only remaining member of an ancient <strong>genus</strong> dating back to the time of the dinosaurs, over 150 million years ago (2). This fascinating tree was only discovered as recently as 1994, and has caused great excitement in the botanical world. These conifers are tall trees with slender crowns; mature individuals often have many trunks that emerge from the base with some consisting of up to 100 stems of differing sizes (3). The bark has a bumpy surface caused by numerous spongy nodules covering the trunk of older trees. As the leaves mature, they develop from bright lime-green to a more yellowish-green (2). Both male and female cones are borne on each tree, with female ones on higher branches; the narrow male cones are reddish-brown in colour, whilst female cones are more rounded and mature from green to brown (3). The small, brown seeds that are produced are thin and papery with a wing around the edge to aid wind-dispersal (3).</p></p><h2><img src="/rimg/factsheet/Range.png" class="heading" /></h2><p class="Range"><p>Wollemi pines have an extremely limited distribution, being known from just two, barely separated sites within Wollemi National Park in New South Wales, Australia (3). As of 1998, the population numbered just 40 adult trees and around 200 seedlings (3).</p></p><h2><img src="/rimg/factsheet/Habitat.png" class="heading" /></h2><p class="Habitat"><p>Inhabits deep sandstone gorges were there is warm, temperate rainforest vegetation (3).</p></p><h2><img src="/rimg/factsheet/Biology.png" class="heading" /></h2><p class="Biology"><p>Wollemi pines reproduce both sexually, through wind-pollination, and <strong>vegetatively</strong>, resulting in numerous trunks arising on a single tree (3). It may be that only the oldest trunks are able to produce seeds; female cones are observed year-round but male cones mature in late September and early October, releasing their pollen over the next few months (3).</p>
<p>Seedlings appear to be slow-growing (3) and mature trees are extremely long-lived; some of the older individuals today are estimated to be between 500 and 1000 years old (2).</p></p><h2><img src="/rimg/factsheet/Threats.png" class="heading" /></h2><p class="Threats"><p>The remaining population of Wollemi pines may represent a relict of the previous extent of this species; it is thought that these trees may have been undergoing a slow, natural decline for thousands of years (3). The species is today threatened by the small size and limited range of its population, which is intrinsically at risk from any chance event that may occur, such as fire or the spread of disease (3).</p></p><h2><img src="/rimg/factsheet/Conservation.png" class="heading" /></h2><p class="Conservation"><p>The Wollemi pine is protected in Australia and the population is located within the Wollemi Pine National Park. A Recovery Plan has been drawn up, outlining strategies for the management of this fragile population; the overall objective is to ensure that this species remains viable in the long-term (3). Such a fascinating tree may have much to reveal about ancient species that were previously known only from fossils. Its discovery underlines the vital role that habitat conservation has to play in the preservation of biodiversity (3).</p></p><h2><img src="/rimg/factsheet/FurtherInformation.png" class="heading" /></h2><p class="Find out more"><p>For more on the Wollemi pine see the Species Recovery Plan: <br/><a href="http://www.environment.gov.au/biodiversity/threatened/publications/wollemia-nobilis.html" target="_blank">http://www.environment.gov.au/biodiversity/threatened/publications/wollemia-nobilis.html</a></p></p><h2><img src="/rimg/factsheet/Authentication.png" class="heading" /></h2><p class="AuthenticatioModel"><p>This information is awaiting authentication by a species expert, and will be updated as soon as possible.

<ul>
<li><strong>Genus: </strong>a category used in taxonomy, which is below ‘family’ and above ‘species’. A genus tends to contain species that have characteristics in common. The genus forms the first part of a ‘binomial’ Latin species name; the second part is the specific name.</li>
<li><strong>Vegetatively: </strong>type of asexual reproduction (reproduction without recombination of genetic material) that results in the propagation of plants using only the vegetative tissues such as leaves or stems. The resulting plant is genetically identical to the original plant. A well-known example of this is the reproduction of strawberry plants from 'runners'.</li>
