        <h2><img src="/rimg/factsheet/Status.png" class="heading" /></h2><p class="Status"><p>The Catalina mahogany is classified as Critically Endangered (CR) on the IUCN Red List (1).</p></p><h2><img src="/rimg/factsheet/Description.png" class="heading" /></h2><p class="Description"><p>With only seven adult plants remaining in 2002, the Catalina mahogany (<em>Cercocarpus traskiae</em>) is one of the rarest plants in the world (3) (4).</p>
<p>The Catalina mahogany is a small (5), long-lived <strong>evergreen</strong> tree or shrub with thick, stiff, leathery leaves. The oval leaves are densely covered with hairs on the lower surface (6), and are between 2.5 and 6 centimetres long (2).</p>
<p>The flowers of the Catalina mahogany are produced in clusters of four to ten (6), and do not have petals (7). Each flower produces a dry (6), cylindrical fruit (7) containing a single (6), feathery seed (7). &nbsp;</p></p><h2><img src="/rimg/factsheet/Range.png" class="heading" /></h2><p class="Range"><p>The Catalina mahogany is only found on Santa Catalina Island, California (3). Shockingly, only seven pure, mature Catalina mahogany individuals remain, with a further five hybrid plants in existence (4). The mature individuals of this species occur alongside around 100 seedlings and saplings (6) in Wild Boar Gully (4).</p></p><h2><img src="/rimg/factsheet/Habitat.png" class="heading" /></h2><p class="Habitat"><p>The Catalina mahogany is found on just one steep slope on Santa Catalina Island. The coastal slope consists of <strong>sage scrub</strong> on reddish <strong>gabbro soils</strong>, which are formed from the breakdown of a type of dark, igneous rock (3).</p></p><h2><img src="/rimg/factsheet/Biology.png" class="heading" /></h2><p class="Biology"><p>Due to the Catalina mahogany’s extreme rarity, much is still unknown about this species’ biology.</p>
<p>Like other <em>Cercocarpus</em> species, it is likely that the Catalina mahogany is wind-<strong>pollinated</strong>. Once <strong>fertilisation</strong> has taken place, the long, cylindrical fruit develops, which has a long ‘tail’ of white hairs that enables the seeds to be carried by the wind. Ripened fruits of <em>Cercocarpus</em> trees typically disperse from July to October (7).</p>
<p>As a long-lived tree, the Catalina mahogany may take many years to reach maturity (6).</p></p><h2><img src="/rimg/factsheet/Threats.png" class="heading" /></h2><p class="Threats"><p>Historically, a major threat to the Catalina mahogany was the introduction of <strong>herbivores</strong>, such as goats, deer and pigs, to Santa Catalina Island. Goats and deer ate the seedling shoots and the leaves of the tree, while pigs rooting through the ground destroyed seedlings and the roots (6).</p>
<p><strong>Hybridisation</strong> with the closely related California mountain mahogany (<em>Cercocarpus betuloides</em>) is currently a significant threat to the Catalina mahogany (6). Already, there are five <strong>hybrid</strong> plants alongside the seven pure individuals in Wild Boar Gully (4). <strong>Hybridisation</strong> between different species will result in a loss of <strong>genetic diversity</strong> which could impact upon the future survival of the Catalina mahogany (6).</p>
<p>Another possible threat comes from non-native invasive plant species. Unfortunately, erecting fences around the remaining Catalina mahogany individuals to exclude <strong>herbivores</strong> has resulted in a build-up of both native and non-native plant species within the enclosure (6).</p>
<p>The increase in vegetation in the fenced area has also resulted in a potential increase in the risk of fires. Fires on Santa Catalina Island are fairly infrequent, although fires from lightning strikes have occurred, and such events are known to be a threat to seedlings and saplings (6).</p></p><h2><img src="/rimg/factsheet/Conservation.png" class="heading" /></h2><p class="Conservation"><p>Conservation efforts began in the 1970s with a detailed inventory of the remaining Catalina mahogany plants (8). In 1999, the entire Wild Boar Gully area was fenced off, enclosing 45 hectares (4). This action was successful and resulted in the numbers of seedlings and saplings increasing year after year, reaching a peak of 113 individuals in 2002. However, it is not known what portion of these seedlings and saplings are the Catalina mahogany and which are <strong>hybrids</strong> (6).</p>
<p>An effort has also been made to remove invasive <strong>herbivores</strong> from Santa Catalina Island. All goats have been removed from the island, and just a small number of pigs now remain (6).</p>
<p>Recommended future actions include establishing a seed bank for the Catalina mahogany to preserve its <strong>genetic diversity</strong>, and attempting to establish further Catalina mahogany populations, to protect against unpredictable natural events (6). It also needs to be determined whether the seedlings and saplings present in Wild Boar Gully are pure Catalina mahogany individuals, or <strong>hybrids</strong> (6).</p></p><h2><img src="/rimg/factsheet/FurtherInformation.png" class="heading" /></h2><p class="Find out more"><p>Learn more about the Catalina mahogany:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Evergreen: </strong>a plant which retains leaves all year round. This is in contrast to deciduous plants, which completely lose their leaves for part of the year.</li>
<li><strong>Fertilisation: </strong>the fusion of gametes (male and female reproductive cells) to produce an embryo, which grows into a new individual.</li>
<li><strong>Gabbro soils: </strong>soil resulting from the breakdown of a dark igneous rock. Recognisable by their red colouration, gabbro soils support a large number of plants found nowhere else in the world.</li>
<li><strong>Genetic diversity (genetic variation): </strong>the variety of genes within a particular species, population or breed causing differences in morphology, physiology and behaviour.</li>
<li><strong>Herbivores: </strong>animals that consume only vegetable matter.</li>
<li><strong>Hybridisation: </strong>cross-breeding between two different species or subspecies.</li>
<li><strong>Hybrids: </strong>the offspring produced by parents of two different species or subspecies. </li>
<li><strong>Pollinated: </strong>to transfer pollen grains from the stamen (male part of a flower) to the stigma (female part of a flower) of a flowering plant.  This usually leads to fertilisation, the development of seeds and, eventually, a new plant.</li>
<li><strong>Sage scrub: </strong>a low scrubland community characterised by low-growing aromatic shrubs and shrubs that lose their leaves during the hotter, drier months. Coastal sage scrub is commonly found in California's coastal zone.</li>
