        <h2><img src="/rimg/factsheet/Status.png" class="heading" /></h2><p class="Status"><p>The Mount Glorious spiny crayfish is classified as Critically Endangered (CR) on the IUCN Red List (1).</p></p><h2><img src="/rimg/factsheet/Description.png" class="heading" /></h2><p class="Description"><p>The Mount Glorious spiny crayfish (<em>Euastacus setosus</em>) is a highly threatened crayfish, of the <em>Euastacus</em> genus, which is the largest of the ten Australian crayfish <strong>genera</strong> and includes some of the largest and rarest species of crayfish in the world (2).</p>
<p>Often broadly referred to as the ‘spiny crayfish’, many species in the <strong>genus</strong> <em>Euastacus</em> are armed with prominent and well-developed spines. However, the Mount Glorious spiny crayfish has greatly reduced spines and, along with other less spiny species in the <strong>genus</strong>, it has been grouped into a distinctive complex from south-east Queensland, known as the <em>setosus</em> complex (3).</p>
<p>Like other crayfish, this large, freshwater species has a <strong>carapace</strong> that protects the head and internal organs. The six segments of the <strong>abdomen</strong> are individually encased, with a flexible membrane between them to allow movement. Crayfish also have a pair of large fore-claws, followed by four pairs of walking legs and then four pairs of small swimming legs, called ‘swimmerets’. These swimmerets are covered with fine hairs, to which the female attaches her eggs. A central tail flap is surrounded by four other flaps that are used to move the crayfish rapidly through the water, as well as curling up to form a brood chamber. The eyes are each borne on an eyestalk, while a pair of large feelers (or <strong>antennae</strong>) and a pair of small, fine, centrally-located feelers (or antennules) make the crayfish’s sense of touch and taste particularly sensitive.</p></p><h2><img src="/rimg/factsheet/Range.png" class="heading" /></h2><p class="Range"><p>The Mount Glorious spiny crayfish is <strong>endemic</strong> to Australia. It is known only from the headwater tributaries of the Pine River, near Mount Glorious, Brisbane, where it occurs in a small number of sites at elevations above 500 metres (1) (2).</p>
<p>It is possible that the Mount Glorious spiny crayfish occurs elsewhere in the surrounding D'Aguilar Range, although extensive clearing of rainforest in the area means that suitable remaining habitat for this species is limited (1) (2).</p></p><h2><img src="/rimg/factsheet/Habitat.png" class="heading" /></h2><p class="Habitat"><p>A freshwater crayfish, the Mount Glorious spiny crayfish inhabits the cool waters close to the source of creeks and streams in areas of rainforest. Like other species of <em>Euastacus</em>, this species prefers heavily shaded, well-oxygenated waters, where it can burrow under logs and rocks (1) (2).</p></p><h2><img src="/rimg/factsheet/Biology.png" class="heading" /></h2><p class="Biology"><p>Very little specific information is available about the biology of the Mount Glorious spiny crayfish.</p>
<p>In general, freshwater crayfish have strong jaws and two pairs of secondary jaws, called maxillae, which allow them to consume a wide variety of both plant and animal matter (4) (5). Most crayfish are <strong>nocturnal</strong>, remaining in burrows during the day, or under stones and logs (5).</p>
<p>Breeding typically occurs in the autumn in most <em>Euastacus</em> species, when the male transfers sperm to the female to <strong>fertilise</strong> the eggs. In some species the first pair of appendages on the <strong>abdomen</strong> has grooves, along which the sperm flows, although the sperm may also be transferred to the female as a <strong>spermatophore</strong> (4). The female typically lays a large clutch of eggs which are attached to the bristles on the swimmerets, where they remain for the whole <strong>incubation</strong> period. Unusually among <strong>crustaceans</strong>, crayfish do not have a <strong>larval</strong> stage (4) (5).</p>
<p>Chemical signals are thought to play an important role in the crayfish life cycle, and may have a role in courtship, brood care and aggressive interactions between individuals. Aggression is a common crayfish social behaviour which establishes a dominance hierarchy, with more dominant individuals gaining better access to shelter, food and mating partners (6).</p></p><h2><img src="/rimg/factsheet/Threats.png" class="heading" /></h2><p class="Threats"><p>The Mount Glorious spiny crayfish is a particularly vulnerable species due to its extremely restricted range. Localised threats, such as bush fires, poor forest management practices, habitat destruction and over-exploitation by collectors are all known to negatively impact this species’ population. Additionally, introduced species such as the cane toad (<em>Bufo marinus</em>), as well as cats, foxes, pigs and goats, have all been found to affect crayfish populations (1) (2).</p>
<p>Climate change is also likely to pose a major threat to the Mount Glorious spiny crayfish (1) (2) (7), with increasing temperatures, decreased rainfall, which will alter hydrological regimes, severe weather events and loss of suitable highland habitat all likely to impact heavily on this threatened freshwater crayfish. This species has a limited thermal tolerance and, consequently, it is restricted to cool headwater streams in forested catchment areas. Therefore, increasing temperatures are likely to result in further range contraction of this species (1) (2).</p>
<p>The Mount Glorious spiny crayfish may also be confused with several other crayfish in the <strong>genus</strong> <em>Cherax</em>, and may therefore be accidentally taken by recreational fishers (1) (2).</p></p><h2><img src="/rimg/factsheet/Conservation.png" class="heading" /></h2><p class="Conservation"><p>The range of the Mount Glorious spiny crayfish coincides with Maiala National Park, which may afford this species some level of protection. However, there are currently no specific conservation measures targeted at the Mount Glorious spiny crayfish (1). All species in the <em>Euastacus</em> <strong>genus</strong> are designated as ‘no take’ species in Queensland under the Fisheries Act 1994, and must be released if captured (1) (2).</p>
<p>There is an urgent requirement to carry out further research on the Mount Glorious spiny crayfish, which will greatly aid any future conservation or management initiatives for the species. Information on its biology, life history, population size, habitat requirements, thermal tolerances and resilience to exotic species are particularly required (2).</p></p><h2><img src="/rimg/factsheet/FurtherInformation.png" class="heading" /></h2><p class="Find out more"><p>Find out more about Australian crayfish:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Abdomen: </strong>in arthropods (crustaceans, insects and arachnids) the abdomen is the hind region of the body, which is usually segmented to a degree (but not visibly in most spiders). In crustacea (such as crabs) some of the limbs attach to the abdomen.</li>
<li><strong>Antennae: </strong>pair of sensory structures on the head of invertebrates. </li>
<li><strong>Carapace: </strong>the top shell of a turtle or tortoise. In arthropods (insects, crabs etc), the fused head and thorax (the part of the body located near the head), also known as the ‘cephalothorax’.</li>
<li><strong>Crustaceans: </strong>diverse group of arthropods (a phylum of animals with jointed limbs and a hard chitinous exoskeleton) characterised by the possession of two pairs of antennae, one pair of mandibles (mouthparts used for handling and processing food) and two pairs of maxillae (appendages used in eating, which are located behind the mandibles). Includes crabs, lobsters, shrimps, woodlice and barnacles.</li>
<li><strong>Endemic: </strong>a species or taxonomic group that is only found in one particular country or geographic area.</li>
<li><strong>Fertilisation: </strong>the fusion of gametes (male and female reproductive cells) to produce an embryo, which grows into a new individual.</li>
<li><strong>Genus: </strong>a category used in taxonomy, which is below ‘family’ and above ‘species’. A genus tends to contain species that have characteristics in common. The genus forms the first part of a ‘binomial’ Latin species name; the second part is the specific name.</li>
<li><strong>Incubation: </strong>the act of incubating eggs, that is, keeping them warm so that development is possible.</li>
<li><strong>Larval: </strong>of the stage in an animal’s lifecycle after it hatches from the egg. Larvae are typically very different in appearance to adults; they are able to feed and move around but usually are unable to reproduce.</li>
<li><strong>Nocturnal: </strong>active at night.</li>
<li><strong>Spermatophore: </strong>gelatinous jelly cone with a sperm cap deposited by a male during courtship and picked up by the cloacal lips of the female.</li>
<li><strong>Thorax: </strong>part of the body located near the head in animals. In insects, the three segments between the head and the abdomen, each of which has a pair of legs. In vertebrates the thorax contains the heart and the lungs.</li>
