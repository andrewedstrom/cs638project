        <h2><img src="/rimg/factsheet/Status.png" class="heading" /></h2><p class="Status"><p>The mountain pygmy-possum is classified as Critically Endangered (EN) on the IUCN Red List&nbsp;(1).</p></p><h2><img src="/rimg/factsheet/Description.png" class="heading" /></h2><p class="Description"><p>The largest of the pygmy-possums, the mountain pygmy-possum was only known from fossil records until it was discovered in the Australian Alps in 1966. This small <strong>marsupial</strong> has fine dense fur, which is grey on the back and a creamy colour underneath. Males develop a more fawn-orange coat during the breeding season. The tail is <strong>prehensile</strong> and, at up to 16 centimetres, is longer than the body&nbsp;(2) (3).</p></p><h2><img src="/rimg/factsheet/Range.png" class="heading" /></h2><p class="Range"><p>Found in three geographically isolated populations in south east Australia: two in Victoria in the Mt. Bogong - Mt. Higginbotham range and at Mt. Buller, and the other in Kosciuszko National Park, New South Wales&nbsp;(3) (4).</p></p><h2><img src="/rimg/factsheet/Habitat.png" class="heading" /></h2><p class="Habitat"><p>&nbsp;The mountain pygmy-possum inhabits mountain summits at elevations of between 1,500 and 2,228 metres, where there are rock screes and boulderfields. This species is usually associated with mountain plum-pine (<em>Podocarpus lawrencei</em>) heathland and adjacent alpine communities, and is the only Australian mammal confined to alpine environments&nbsp;(1)&nbsp;(2).</p></p><h2><img src="/rimg/factsheet/Biology.png" class="heading" /></h2><p class="Biology"><p>Unlike most possums, the mountain pygmy-possum is mainly terrestrial, although it is also an adept climber. Living at high altitude, the mountain pygmy-possum <strong>hibernates</strong> during the winter months from March / April to September / October. To survive <strong>hibernation</strong> these possums put on large amounts of fat and then roll into a ball to conserve heat, while snow cover also provides important insulation. During the winter, like all <strong>hibernators</strong>, individuals regularly arouse for short periods from <strong>torpor</strong>, and will occasionally move to more suitable <strong>hibernacula</strong> sites. The mountain pygmy-possum stores seeds in caches in captivity, but does not appear to feed during the winter <strong>hibernation</strong> period in the wild&nbsp;(5). Possums are <strong>nocturnal</strong> and during the 'active season', which runs from October to April, will feed primarily on the high energy Bogong moth (<em>Agrotis infusa</em>), which arrives in the Australian Alps in large numbers in the summer months to <strong>aestivate</strong> in the cool rock crevices of the boulderfields. As numbers of these moths decrease in the late summer and autumn, the pygmy-possum switches its diet to seeds and berries, cracking open the hard cases with its large, specialised premolar tooth&nbsp;(1)&nbsp;(2)&nbsp;(3)&nbsp;(4).</p></p><h2><img src="/rimg/factsheet/Threats.png" class="heading" /></h2><p class="Threats"><p>Due to the restrictions of its habitat requirements, the mountain pygmy-possum has suffered from the development of the ski industry in the Australian Alps. A further threat comes from habitat loss caused by increased temperatures and decreasing snow cover as a result of global warming, while predation by the red fox (<em>Vulpes vulpes</em>) and feral cats is also a problem&nbsp;(1)&nbsp;(2)&nbsp;(3)&nbsp;(4). Bushfires in 2003 damaged large areas of habitat&nbsp;(2), and the mountain pygmy-possum’s main prey, the Bogong moth, also faces a number of threats, including pesticide use in its breeding grounds&nbsp;(2)&nbsp;(3). The mountain pygmy-possum occupies just a tiny area, estimated at less than seven square kilometres, and its populations are highly fragmented, putting it at particular risk&nbsp;(1)&nbsp;(4).</p></p><h2><img src="/rimg/factsheet/Conservation.png" class="heading" /></h2><p class="Conservation"><p>The entire range of the mountain pygmy-possum occurs within protected areas, although important parts of these are in ski-resort lease areas. Management plans for the species have been put in place in Victoria and New South Wales, and a national recovery plan is currently being prepared&nbsp;(1). A range of conservation measures have been recommended for this small possum, including protection and restoration of the remaining habitat, population and habitat monitoring, predator control, measures to protect the possums in ski resorts, further research, and captive breeding programmes&nbsp;(1)&nbsp;(3)&nbsp;(4).</p></p><h2><img src="/rimg/factsheet/FurtherInformation.png" class="heading" /></h2><p class="Find out more"><p>To find out more about the mountain pygmy-possum see:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Aestivate: </strong>to become dormant during the summer or dry season, analogous to hibernation in winter.</li>
<li><strong>Gestation: </strong>the state of being pregnant; the period from conception to birth.</li>
<li><strong>Hibernacula: </strong>sites where hibernation (a winter survival strategy in which an animal’s metabolic rate slows down and a state of deep sleep is attained) takes place.</li>
<li><strong>Hibernation: </strong>a winter survival strategy characteristic of some mammals in which an animal's metabolic rate slows down and a state of deep sleep is attained. Whilst hibernating, animals survive on stored reserves of fat that they have accumulated in summer. In insects, the correct term for hibernation is 'diapause', a temporary pause in development and growth. Any stage of the lifecycle (eggs, larvae, pupae or adults) may enter diapause, which is typically associated with winter.</li>
<li><strong>Marsupial: </strong>a diverse group of mammals characterised by their reproduction. The embryo is born 11-35 days after conception. The tiny newborn crawls into the marsupium (pouch) and attaches to a teat where it stays for a variable amount of time. They also differ from placental mammals in their dentition.</li>
<li><strong>Natal: </strong>site of birth.</li>
<li><strong>Nocturnal: </strong>active at night.</li>
<li><strong>Prehensile: </strong>capable of grasping.</li>
<li><strong>Torpor: </strong>a sleep-like state in which the body processes slow to a fraction of their normal rate.</li>
