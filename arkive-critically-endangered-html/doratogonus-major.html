        <h2><img src="/rimg/factsheet/Status.png" class="heading" /></h2><p class="Status"><p>The major black millipede is classified as Critically Endangered (CR) on the IUCN&nbsp;Red List (1).</p></p><h2><img src="/rimg/factsheet/Description.png" class="heading" /></h2><p class="Description"><p>Like other members of the <strong>genus</strong> <i>Doratogonus</i>, the major black millipede is a rather large-bodied and conspicuous African millipede (1). <i>Doratogonus</i> species are generally black or blackish-brown in colour, often with brown or yellowish legs and <strong>antennae</strong>&nbsp;(2), and are most reliably distinguished from each other by the male’s gonopods (specially modified legs for the transfer of sperm) (2) (3). The major black millipede has the typical millipede form, with a body composed of numerous hard, ring-like segments, each of which bears two pairs of legs, except the first and last, which are legless, and the second, third and fourth, which possess only a single pair. There is a single pair of simple, chewing mouthparts (maxillae), a single pair of <strong>antennae</strong>, and ‘eyes’ that consist of large numbers of simple, light-detecting lenses known as ocelli (4) (5).</p></p><h2><img src="/rimg/factsheet/Range.png" class="heading" /></h2><p class="Range"><p>The major black millipede is known only from Gwaliweni Forest in northern KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa (1).</p></p><h2><img src="/rimg/factsheet/Habitat.png" class="heading" /></h2><p class="Habitat"><p>The major black millipede is known from a forest area of only 11 square kilometres (1), and is unlikely to survive in grassland where woody vegetation is lacking (6). Like other, related species, it is likely to be found in leaf litter or beneath stones or logs (5), although detailed information on its ecology is lacking.</p></p><h2><img src="/rimg/factsheet/Biology.png" class="heading" /></h2><p class="Biology"><p>Little information is available on the biology of the major black millipede. However, like most other millipedes, it is likely to be slow-moving, burrowing through soil and leaf litter and feeding on plant material, generally preferring leaves that have already been partly decomposed by bacteria and fungi. Food is chewed using the stout mouthparts, while receptors on the <strong>antennae</strong> allow the millipede to feel objects and detect chemical signals in the environment (4) (5). Being slow-moving, millipedes rely on the hard <strong>exoskeleton</strong> and on chemical secretions for defence (5).</p>
<p>In most millipedes, reproduction involves the transfer of sperm from the male to the female using one or more specially modified pairs of legs, known as gonopods. The female may then lay the eggs in a prepared nest, but usually leaves them to hatch alone. The young hatch into a legless ‘pupoid’ stage, possessing only around seven body segments, and then pass through various stages, known as stadia, adding more body segments, legs and ocelli at each stage (4) (5). The major black millipede is thought to take at least two years to reach maturity (1).</p></p><h2><img src="/rimg/factsheet/Threats.png" class="heading" /></h2><p class="Threats"><p>The single, tiny forest area in which the major black millipede occurs is under threat from the extraction of wood by the local community for fuel and building, and its population is also likely to be small, putting it at increased risk of extinction (1).</p></p><h2><img src="/rimg/factsheet/Conservation.png" class="heading" /></h2><p class="Conservation"><p>The Gwaliweni Forest is managed by KZN Wildlife, although wood extraction there continues (1). No specific conservation measures are known to be in place for the major black millipede, and, despite having an important role in ecosystems as nutrient recyclers (5), <strong>invertebrates</strong> such as millipedes tend to be overlooked in conservation policies (2) (7),&nbsp;with less than half of South Africa’s <strong>invertebrates</strong> even officially named (2). Some efforts are underway to collate information on these species, such as the Green Trust Database of Threatened South African Invertebrates (2), and such initiatives will be important in improving the conservation of species such as this little-known millipede (1).</p></p><h2><img src="/rimg/factsheet/FurtherInformation.png" class="heading" /></h2><p class="Find out more"><p>To find out more about the conservation of invertebrates and other wildlife in South Africa see:</p>

<li><strong>Antennae: </strong>pair of sensory structures on the head of invertebrates.</li>
<li><strong>Exoskeleton: </strong>an external skeleton that supports and protects an animal’s body.</li>
<li><strong>Genus: </strong>a category used in taxonomy, which is below ‘family’ and above ‘species’. A genus tends to contain species that have characteristics in common. The genus forms the first part of a ‘binomial’ Latin species name; the second part is the specific name.</li>
<li><strong>Invertebrates: </strong>animals with no backbone, such as insects, crustaceans, worms, molluscs, spiders, cnidarians (jellyfish, corals, sea anemones), echinoderms, and others.</li>
