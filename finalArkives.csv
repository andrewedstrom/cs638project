0,0,Papasula abbotti,abbotts booby ,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Pelecaniformes,Sulidae,Papasula ,Length: 79 cm (2),Phosphate mining on Christmas Island in the 1960s and 70s caused the destruction of a third of Abbott's booby nesting habitat and has led to the subsequent deterioration of the remaining forest (4). Birds are strongly attached to nest sites and clearings are more exposed to wind turbulence which has a detrimental effect on breeding success and causes higher adult mortality (6). Recent development proposals for the island have again raised concern over the viability of remaining breeding habitat (5).,The majority of Abbott's booby nest sites occur within the Christmas Island National Park which was established in 1980 and covers 63 percent of the island (6). Nest site locations are monitored and the regeneration of previously cleared forest has occurred on much of the island (5). Although mining was resumed in 1990 it only involved the reworking of previously mined areas (6). The continued preservation and ban on clearing of the unique Christmas Island rainforest will be the key to the future viability of the Abbott's booby population (5). , , ,0,0.0

3,3,Tiliqua adelaidensis,adelaide pygmy bluetongue skink ,Animalia,Chordata,Reptilia,Squamata,Scincidae,Tiliqua ,Male snout-vent length: 3.8 - 10.6 cm (2)Female snout-vent length: 8.8 - 10.7 cm (2)Tail length: 2.2 - 7.9 cm (2),The Adelaide pygmy bluetongue skink was once feared to be the first of Australiaâ??s approximately 700 reptiles to become extinct since European colonization. Thankfully it was rediscovered in 1992 after 33 years of being presumed extinct (3). Currently only ten small populations of the Adelaide pygmy bluetongue skinkare known to exist (6). Arguably Australiaâ??s most enigmatic reptile its scarcity can be attributed to its unique ecology as well as population declines due to extensive habitat destruction (2)(3).,The South Australia Department of Environment and Conservation has produced a National Recovery Plan for the Adelaide pygmy bluetongue skink with the overall objective to achieve down-listing of the species from Endangered to Vulnerable within 10 years. The plan details actions such as ensuring remaining habitat is protected from any further degradation and undertaking field studies to establish the skinkâ??s habitat requirements (6). At present all populations of the Adelaide pygmy bluetongue skink occur on private land making the establishment of agreements with landowners an essential part of any plan and incentives may be offered to landowners to become involved in establishing sanctuaries for the Adelaide pygmy bluetongue skink on their land (6). , ,protected; ,0,1.0
4,4,Spheniscus demersus,african penguin ,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Sphenisciformes,Spheniscidae,Spheniscus ,Length: 60 - 70 cm (2),The population of the African penguin has declined and it is estimated that its current size is a mere 10 percent of what it was at the turn of the 20th Century. Originally the fall in numbers was the result of the over-collection of eggs for food and disturbance caused by the collection of <strong>guano</strong> for fertiliser. Today however depleted fish stocks due to over-fishing and the risk of oil pollution are the most pertinent threats to the survival of the African penguin (5); a recent oil spill affected around 40 percent of the population.  Predation by Cape fur seals (<em>Arctocephalus pusillus</em>) and competition with them for food and breeding sites as well as shark predation has also had severe effects on African penguin numbers (2). The ongoing and rapid decline of the African penguin led to the species being uplisted from Vulnerable to Endangered on the IUCN Red List in 2010 (2).,The African penguin is protected by its listing on Appendix II of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) (3) and on Appendix II of the Convention on Migratory Species (CMS) (4). All of the breeding areas of the African penguin in South Africa are protected as National Parks or Nature Reserves and the collection of <strong>guano</strong> or eggs is no longer permitted. The recovery of rescued oiled African penguins has also been shown to be successful. Populations need further monitoring and the possibility of conserving fish stocks is under investigation amongst other measures if the future of Africaâ??s only penguin is to be secured (2). ,fishing;pet;pollution; ,cites;protected; ,3,2.0
5,5,Lycaon pictus,african wild dog ,Animalia,Chordata,Mammalia,Carnivora,Canidae,Lycaon ,18 - 34 kg (2),African wild dogs require large home ranges to support viable populations and recent habitat fragmentation has caused a population decline (4). African wild dogs traditionally have a reputation for attacking livestock and despite this rarely occurring in practice they are therefore often persecuted wherever they come into contact with humans (2) (4). In addition road accidents and incidental snaring have recently become an important cause of mortality (2). These wild dogs are susceptible to disease; particularly those carried by domestic dogs such as canine distemper and rabies. A final threat that keeps African wild dog populations low is competition and predation with the other large carnivores of the African savanna such as lions and spotted hyaenas (6).,The current population of African wild dogs is estimated to be less than 5500 individuals (2). The majority of dogs are found in medium sized populations which are extremely vulnerable to sudden environmental change. Due to their expansive home ranges large areas of contiguous habitat are the key to the survival of this species and it is estimated that protected areas need to be greater than 10000 square kilometres in order to prevent detrimental contact with local human settlements (2) (4). Consequently even most of the larger reserves cannot fully contain African wild dog packs leading to clashes with humans (2). Preventing persecution through education is also a priority of the conservation action plan (2) (4) in an effort to preserve this most intriguing and unique <strong>canid</strong>. ,fragmentation;disease;pet; ,protected; ,3,1.0
6,6,Loxops coccineus,akepa ,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Fringillidae,Loxops ,Length: 10Â cm (2),With its dependence on large mature trees the extensive forest clearance that has occurred on Hawaii has had a catastrophic effect on the akepa. Not only have significant numbers of mature trees been lost to logging but the remaining exposed trees have become more vulnerable to windfall. Despite reforestation efforts the planted trees take decades to develop natural cavities and cannot possibly provide the akepa with nesting habitat fast enough to offset its rapid population decline (2) (3).,Listed as Endangered by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service in 1970 the akepa was one of the species targeted in the 1982 Hawaii Forest Bird Recovery Plan leading to the improved protection and management of its habitat (3). A number of protected areas currently support akepa populations in particular Hakalau Forest National Wildlife Refuge which contains large numbers. Within these areas reforestation efforts are helping to restore this speciesâ?? habitat in the long-term while artificial nesting boxes are providing a promising short-term benefit to the akepaâ??s survival (2) (3). ,disease; ,captive breeding;protected; ,1,2.0

The introduction of mosquitoes to Hawaii has resulted in the spread of avian diseases which confine many bird species including the â??Akiapolaâ??au to higher elevations. This species has a low reproductive rate and is slow to recover from population reductions (2).,Relatively large â??Akiapolaâ??au populations are found within the boundaries of Kaâ??u Forest Reserve and Hakalau Forest National Wildlife Refuge. Outside these areas some habitat is being restored (2) and young koa forests on the volcano of Mauna Loa now support high densities of Akiapolaau (6). It is hoped that the â??Akiapolaâ??au might be <strong>re-introduced</strong> into other newly restored habitat.

The resilience of the wood is evident from roofing tiles that are still in good condition despite being between 130 - 150 years old (2). Lumbering in Chile began towards the end of the 16th Century and continued right up to 1976 when the species was declared a National Monument and the cutting of trees was therefore prohibited (7). The massive over-exploitation of the alerce caused population numbers to be decimated and by the early 1900s a third of the <em>Fitzroya</em> forests had been lost (1). The naturally slow regeneration of this species means that any timber harvest is unsustainable and despite logging bans the species has not shown any sign of recovery (2). Today the coastal populations appear to be declining although the direct cause is unclear; large tracts of dead white stems have been found although the time of death in many of these stands is unknown (7).,Logging of <em>Fitzroya cupressoides</em> is prohibited throughout the range of this magnificent tree and international trade is banned by its listing on Appendix I of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) (1). In collaboration with the Royal Botanic Gardens Edinburgh the University of Santiago is carrying out research into the conditions required for regeneration in order to assist propagation of these trees (8). The Global Trees Campaign is also involved in initiatives to restore and conserve remnant forests (6).

16,16,Leopardus jacobita,andean cat ,Animalia,Chordata,Mammalia,Carnivora,Felidae,Oreailurus ,4 kg (2),It is not clear whether the rarity of the Andean cat is a natural phenomenon or attributable to human actions. Alternatively it may simply be a misperception resulting from lack of observations (2). Pelts of this species have been seen in local markets occasionally killed by herders who carry guns (2). The high Andean Indians appear to have little knowledge of this species and the only pelts observed to be used in local ceremonies have been those of the pampas cat (5). There are no records of international trade of this species either. It is therefore thought that hunting of the Andean cat is primarily carried out to protect local cattle (1). The common threat of habitat destruction common worldwide does not apply here as there have been no significant changes in land-use of the high Andes over the last 2000 years. If anything the human population has decreased in these regions (2).,International trade of this species is prohibited by its listing on Appendix I of CITES (3) and according to national legislation the Andean cat is fully protected throughout its range (2). There is a huge gap in our knowledge of this species and how to best protect it. However since the publication of the Cat Action Treasury Plan there have been substantial increases in research efforts (1) (7). The Cat Action Treasury has sponsored surveys to determine the status of this species and improve our understanding of this cat in order to inform conservation measures (8). These surveys confirmed the rarity of this species. The Andean cat has been upgraded from Vulnerable to Endangered on the IUCN Red List (1) (7). It has been suggested by the Andean Cat Alliance (AGA) previously the Committee for the Conservation of the Andean Cat (COCGA) that because this cat needs large areas to live successfully and its range extends over the Andes through international borders a multinational cooperative approach is necessary for its long-term conservation (5). AGA has launched a multinational project to collate and analyse data on the on the Andean cat in order to initiate immediate conservation efforts and in 2004 a conservation action plan was drawn up for the species.

Numbers of Apolinarâ??s wren have indeed declined significantly in the last 50 to 70 years primarily due to a 95 percent loss in habitat (3). A significant cause of this habitat destruction is the burning of wetlands for agriculture mainly onion cultivation and cattle-farming. With agriculture also frequently comes the use of insecticides and other chemicals resulting in a reduction in this birdâ??s insect prey and posing a toxic threat to the bird. In areas around the capital BogotÃ¡ remaining wetland habitats are at risk from human settlement and highway development and reed-harvesting and tourism also pose minor threats (1).,Apolinarâ??s wren occurs in El Cocuy National Park BoyacÃ¡ and in SumapÃ¡z National Park Cundinamarca which may offer protection against the threat of habitat loss (2). ,loss; ,captive breeding; ,1,1.0

27,27,Arabitragus jayakari,arabian tahr ,Animalia,Chordata,Mammalia,Cetartiodactyla,Bovidae,Arabitragus ,c. 23 kg (2),The Arabian tahr is currently extremely endangered as a result of intense grazing competition from livestock illegal hunting and habitat degradation through human development (5). Unfortunately the speciesâ?? dependence upon visiting waterholes leaves it vulnerable to ambush by poachers (3). Human migrations to urban areas have increased in Oman in recent years resulting in domestic goats being left to become feral which now forage in areas that were once the realm of the tahr. Additionally several roads and buildings have been constructed near and within the tahrâ??s range which are new potential sources of disturbance pollution and habitat fragmentation. In particular plans for mineral extraction in southern parts of the range could result in significant habitat loss (6). Tahr populations in UAE appear to be especially localised and possibly isolated. The concern is that isolation of sub-populations will lead to the diminished genetic variation associated with inbreeding which in turn results in increased susceptibility to disease and decreased fertility spelling disaster for the Arabian tahr in UAE (3).,In 1973 efforts were initiated to protect the Arabian tahr and in 1975 active protection was granted over a wide range of the eastern Hajar Mountains of Oman with local men recruited as rangers under the Office of the Advisor for Conservation of the Environment (6). Unfortunately this area still awaits to be awarded official status by a Royal Decree with an approved funded and implemented management plan (6) (7). However in 2009 Wadi Wurayah Fujairah home to the Arbaian tahr and other rare and endangered species was officially declared as the United Arab Emiratesâ?? first protected mountain area (8). ,loss;fragmentation;hunting;disease;pet;pollution; ,captive breeding;protected; ,6,2.0

29,29,Iberolacerta aranica,aran rock lizard ,Animalia,Chordata,Reptilia,Squamata,Lacertidae,Iberolacerta ,Snout-vent length: up to 6 cm (2),The rocky alpine habitat of the Aran rock lizard is currently threatened by overgrazing by cattle and may face further pressure in the future from the development of ski resorts and the associated building of roads and tracks (1). The IUCN who assessed the conservation status of this lizard also state the possible development of hydroelectric projects and mining as a future threat to this species (1). The low reproductive potential of the Aran rock lizard and its restricted distribution only act to enhance the devastating effects that such threats may have on the population (3).,The Aran rock lizard is listed on Appendix III of the Bern Convention a convention which aims to conserve wild flora and fauna and their natural habitats and to promote European co-operation in that field (4). Wild animal species on Appendix III are protected but can be exploited if regulated in accordance with the convention (4). It is yet to be seen whether this level of protection is sufficient to ensure the survival of this Endangered reptile. , ,protected; ,0,1.0

Agriculture has progressively encroached upon this habitat while heavy grazing by livestock which has been particularly intense since the introduction of sheep has limited its natural regeneration. This has been exacerbated in areas where <em>Polylepis</em> woodland is exploited for firewood charcoal production and logging and where competitive exotic trees such as <em>Eucalyptus</em> have been introduced (2). Consequently around 50 percent of natural woodlands have been lost from Abra Malaga in Peru and an alarming 26 percent of original diversity may have already been lost (4) (6). Facing such intense pressure the ash-breasted tit-tyrant has undergone a drastic decline and now the population is near critically low levels (2).  ,Although found in a number of protected areas including the actively managed HuascarÃ¡n National Park the ash-breasted tit-tyrant urgently requires conservation action (2).

35,35,Oceanodroma homochroa,ashy stormpetrel ,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Procellariiformes,Hydrobatidae,Oceanodroma ,37 g (3),Between the 1880s and 1970s the breeding population of ashy storm-petrels at the South Farallon Islands was stable. However in the early 1990s a twenty-year study reported an alarming decline of 42 percent in the population (2) (3). More recently these findings have been corroborated by other studies showing continued declines on South Farallon and also at several other important breeding sites (2). No one single cause is considered responsible for the decline but rather a combination of several negative pressures. This includes predation of petrels by gulls and owls and on the larger islands introduced mammals such as rats mice and cats. In particular rapid growth in the population of predatory gulls is of considerable concern at many of the nesting sites. Other reported threats include oil and chemical pollution in foraging areas light pollution from fishing vessels increasing the vulnerability of petrels to predation ingestion of plastics and human disturbance. Furthermore there is long-term concern that climate change may disturb the ocean currents and processes of coastal upwelling which form an integral part of a food web supporting ashy storm-petrels and many other organisms (2) (3).,In light of its restricted range and a current population size that is almost certainly less than the 5000 to 10000 breeding birds estimated in the early to mid-1990s the ashy-storm petrel is listed as Endangered on the IUCN Red List (1) (2). Fortunately despite the threats described most of the breeding colonies are on islands either protected from development or subject to sensitive management (2) (3). Current conservation proposals include eradication of all introduced predators from nesting islands an investigation of the impacts of light chemical and plastics pollution and continued monitoring of population trends (2). Presently the ashy storm-petrel is designated by the California Department of Fish and Game as a Bird Species of Conservation Concern but as of May 2008 it is also under review for protection under the Endangered Species Act (ESA) (6).

38,38,Bubalus bubalis,asian buffalo ,Animalia,Chordata,Mammalia,Cetartiodactyla,Bovidae,Bubalus ,up to 1.2 tonnes (male) (2),Although domestic buffalo are widespread and thriving there is a very real possibility that true wild Asian buffalo will become extinct in the near future if they have not already done so (3). Indeed the total world population is thought to almost certainly be less than 4000 individuals perhaps considerably less but there is also a very real possibility that no pure-bred wild Asian buffalo exist anymore. Unfortunately accurate assessment of numbers is problematic due to the difficulty of distinguishing pure animals from free-ranging domestic or feral buffalo (1). Nevertheless the species is generally accepted to be undergoing very serious declines as a result of hunting habitat loss and degradation as agricultural land use expands and <strong>hybridisation</strong> with domestic and/or feral buffalo (1) (3). Other threats include diseases and parasites transmitted by domestic livestock and competition for food and water between wild and domestic buffalo (1).,Wild Asian buffalo are listed under Appendix III of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) in Nepal which limits the quantity of animal products that can be exported and imported across international borders but this does not regulate domestic trade (4). Nevertheless the species is legally protected across its range in Bhutan Nepal India and Thailand and it is thought that pure-bred populations may occur in several protected areas (1). Existing conservation programmes are focusing on preserving the buffaloâ??s diminishing habitat but this is becoming increasingly difficult as human populations expand and encroachment continues (3). Sadly the future does not look bright for pure-bred Asian buffalo which are currently in very grave danger of disappearing forever if they have not already done so. ,loss;hunting;disease;pet; ,cites;protected; ,4,2.0

In Malaysia the Asian tapir has been given total protection since 1955 under the Wild Animals and Birds Ordinance and law enforcement has generally been effective. The use of steel wire snares has been banned here with stiff penalties if caught. However ongoing monitoring of the illegal tapir trade across the range of this species is crucial (2). Asian tapirs can be found in a number of protected areas including the Huai Kha Khaeng Wildlife Sanctuary and the Khao Sok National Park in Thailand 12 protected areas in the Western Forest Complex along the Thai-Myanmar border (1) and the Way Kambas National Park in Sumatra which contains around 200 individuals (11). However much of the suitable habitat that remains in Sumatra does not lie within protected areas and a large proportion of the tapir population occurs outside of reserves.

Most records indicate that Asian tortoise populations are sparse and extremely fragmented (6). Sadly being such a large species the Asian tortoise is a relatively easy target for hunters and collectors (4) and its fairly high market value makes it a much sought after species (2).,International trade is controlled by the Asian tortoiseâ??s listing on CITES Appendix II (6). However despite the species being uplisted from â??Vulnerableâ?? to â??Endangeredâ?? on the IUCN Red List in 2000 the legal export quota from Peninsula Malaysia was raised from 50 wild caught specimens in 1999 to 200 in 2000 and to 500 in 2002 (3) (6). In 2006 this quota was reduced to 400 (3) but this still seems too high for a species facing possible extinction. Although imports are now totally banned in the European Community this has only served to shift the trade towards Japan and the U.S. (6). The Asian brown tortoise (<i>M. e. emys</i>) is legally protected in Sabah Malaysia under the Wildlife Conservation Enactment 1997 and a license is required from the director of the Wildlife Department to hunt or collect wild specimens (6). ,pet; ,cites;protected; ,1,2.0

The Asian yellow pond turtle is listed on CITES Appendix II which requires export permits for international trade (3).

The extreme isolation of many of the subpopulations is in itself a threat as genetic problems can result from inbreeding (7). Overgrazing by livestock reduces food availability and herders also reduce the availability of water at springs. The cutting down of nutritious shrubs and bushes exacerbates the problem. Furthermore a series of drought years could have devastating effects on this beleaguered species (6). Habitat fragmentation is a particular concern in Mongolia as result of the increasingly dense network of roads railway lines and fences required to support mining activities (1) (5).,The Asiatic wild ass does occur in a number of protected sites where targeted conservation action has been taken. Domestic animals have been removed from some protected areas and artificial watering holes have been made. Hay is provided for the species and there are hefty fines for poaching. Moreover the species is legally protected in many of the countries in which it occurs (6). The priority for future conservation measures is: to ensure the protection of this species in particularly vulnerable parts of its range; to encourage the involvement of local people in the conservation of the Asiatic wild ass; and to conduct further research into the behaviour ecology and taxonomy of the species (1).

Their slow growth rate and late onset of sexual maturity make these fish extremely vulnerable to the effects of over-fishing (5). Not only does this mean that individuals are often harvested many years before reaching maturity and therefore unable to increase abundance through reproduction but also that populations will be slow to recover from collapses in numbers (7). Since population numbers are now too low to sustain target fisheries Atlantic halibut are predominantly taken as <strong>bycatch</strong> by bottom trawlers and longliners (8). Surveys indicate that these fish have continued to decline in the North Atlantic over the past two decades despite being taken only incidentally as <strong>bycatch</strong> with little targeted halibut fishing (7).,There is currently no management plan in place for this fish and it is therefore thought probable that numbers of Atlantic halibut will continue to decline. It has been argued that Atlantic halibut are unlikely to recover simply by banning halibut landings or designating protected areas.

Such a limited range places the bird at risk from chance events such as natural disasters or the introduction of mammalian predators (2) (6). On Gough predation by the introduced house mouse (<i>Mus musculus</i>) is having a severe effect on the Atlantic petrelâ??s breeding success with just two percent of the chicks reaching fledging in 2007 (2).

57,57,Thalassarche chlororhynchos,atlantic yellownosed albatross ,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Procellariiformes,Diomedeidae,Thalassarche ,2.2 kg (3),As a scavenger of fishing vessel bait the Atlantic yellow-nosed albatross is suffering population declines as a result of longline fishing. Longlining is mainly used to catch tuna and swordfish by releasing a line of baited hooks that sink to the appropriate depth for these fish. Many seabirds dive for the bait before it has sunk becoming caught on the hooks and drowning as the line reaches its final depth. The Atlantic yellow-nosed albatross attends trawlers off the coast of south-eastern Brazil and the west coast of southern Africa (2). It also suffers losses as a result of collisions with cables on trawl vessels (6).,The Atlantic yellow-nosed albatross is monitored on Gough Island which is both a nature reserve and a World Heritage Site. A population census was carried out in 2000/2001 and was repeated in 2004. Remote tracking has also been used in order to determine the distribution of these birds at sea. The information obtained will be used to assess the overlap between the birds and longline fishing operations. Longline fishing is controversial and techniques to reduce the seabird catch have been suggested such as weighting lines to sink them more rapidly and setting them at night (2). A Threat Abatement Plan has been put into action by the Australian government which proposes to promote public awareness of the conservation needs of albatrosses and to reduce the <strong>by-catch</strong> of this species and other albatross species (6). ,loss;fishing; , ,2,0.0

The IUCN who assessed the conservation status of this lizard also state the possible development of hydroelectric projects and mining as a future threat to this species (1).  The low reproductive potential of Aurelioâ??s rock lizard and its restricted distribution only act to enhance the devastating effects that such threats may have on the population (3).,Aurelioâ??s rock lizard is listed on Appendix III of the Bern Convention a convention which aims to conserve wild flora and fauna and their natural habitats and to promote European co-operation in that field (4).  Wild animal species on Appendix III are protected but can be exploited if regulated in accordance with the convention (4).

Its very specific habitat requirements means the Australasian bittern is very sensitive to loss of wetlands as areas have been drained for irrigation or to convert land to agriculture (2) (7).,In Australia there are already several sites dedicated to the management of the Australasian bittern population such as Bool Lagoon and Lake Muir (7). In 2007 a Bittern Project was set up which aims to study the Australasian bittern and its habitats raise awareness and educate the local community in an attempt to limit habitat destruction (7) (8).

Since European settlement an estimated 50 percent of Australian wetlands have been modified for human land use. Drainage and diversion of the water in these wetlands have rendered them unsuitable for the Australian painted snipe and constitute the primary threat to this species (3) (6).,As little is known about the Australian painted snipe conservation efforts have focused on improving knowledge of the species through assessing its habitat preferences developing a database of records and conducting annual surveys.

The low reproductive rate of this species means that populations are particularly vulnerable to disturbance such as habitat loss and hunting (5). Vast tracts of rainforest are being cleared to make way for cattle ranching and developments; almost all of the forest in El Salvador has been lost and there is no recent information to suggest that Baird's tapir persists in this country (5).,Baird's tapir the national symbol of Belize is protected in the majority of Central American countries although hunting laws are often poorly enforced (5). Populations are unable to withstand mass logging practices but have been known to survive and even prosper in areas where selective logging occurs which could be an important factor in their conservation (5). The IUCN/SSC Tapir Specialist Group has published a Species Action Plan identifying key actions required to protect this species; including species status surveys and the protection of habitat (5).

70,70,Neomorphus radiolosus,banded groundcuckoo ,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Cuculiformes,Cuculidae,Neomorphus ,Length: 50 cm (2),Rapid deforestation of the ChocÃ³ Biogeographical Region presents the greatest threat to the banded ground-cuckoo. Deforestation has intensified in this region since the mid-1970s along with increased road networks (4). Deforested land has been used for agriculture mainly bananas and cocoa cattle grazing at lower altitudes gold mining and conversion to palm oil plantations (4) (5).,The banded ground-cuckoo occurs in several protected areas which include Munchique National Park and El Pangan Nature reserve in Colombia.

Although these factors have caused a dramatic decline in numbers of the banded hare-wallaby causing their extinction on the mainland those that remain on the uninhabited islands of Dorre and Bernier thankfully remain relatively secure (6).,Unfortunately attempts made to reintroduce this species to Dirk Hartog Island in the 1970s and to Peron Peninsula at Shark Bay in 2001 failed. Cat predation played an important part in these failures as well as intensive browsing by sheep and goats and a period of drought over the summer of 1979/80 on Dirk Hartog resulting in the loss of 30 to 40 percent of the <i>Acacia </i>shrub cover. Captive populations are currently held at the Peron Captive Breeding Facility and the Dryandra Captive Breeding Facility though the latter has experienced problems with aerial predation by the wedge-tailed eagle (8). At last in 2003 and 2004 banded hare-wallabies from Peron Captive Breeding Facility and the Shark Bay Islands were successfully reintroduced to Faure Island after the removal of goats from the island (8) (9). This population is now thriving and represents a remarkable victory for conservation. Banded hare-wallabies have been so successful in adapting to their new environment that they bred in the first year after release providing fresh hope for the long-term survival of this relic species of â??short faced kangarooâ?? (9). ,pet; ,captive breeding; ,1,1.0
72,72,Pterapogon kauderni,banggai cardinalfish ,Animalia,Chordata,Actinopterygii,Perciformes,Apogonidae,Pterapogon ,Length: Up to 80 mm (1),The major threat to the Banggai cardinalfish is overexploitation for the aquarium trade (10) (11). There are currently three main collection centres in the Banggai Archipelago where as many as 100000 individuals may be caught monthly from around the islands before being shipped to Bali and North Sulawesi to be sold to international exporters. During shipping which may take between 24 hours and 5 days up to 30 percent of the fish may die with similar quantities frequently being rejected due to poor condition. A study of the Banggai cardinalfish fishery revealed that during 2007 at least 1000000 individuals were caught which given that the fishâ??s total population in this year was estimated to be 2200000 individuals is a serious cause for concern. Indeed the increasing levels of exploitation have led to the extermination of two local populations while the global population of the Banggai cardinalfish is believed to have been reduced to about 10 percent of its historical abundance and range (11).,A successful captive-breeding program has been developed by the New Jersey Academy for Aquatic Sciences. However the aquarium trade has not yet made any significant efforts to replace wild-caught fish with captive-bred fish (1). ,fishing;disease; ,cites;protected; ,2,2.0

Extinction is thought imminent in Vietnam and in Cambodia and Lao PDR habitat fragmentation caused by agriculture and new settlements is seriously threatening the remaining mainland Asian populations (3). These wild cattle have been domesticated in numerous locations most notably on the island of Bali with over 1.5 million domestic banteng thought to exist (2). Interbreeding with domestic and feral cattle threatens to contaminate the gene pool by hybridization of the remaining wild banteng and disease transmission from domestic livestock is also considered a serious danger (1) (6). The number of banteng trophies reported for sale within Cambodia and the Lao PDR along the Thai/Cambodia Thai/Lao and Thai/Myanmar borders strongly suggests that the banteng population on the mainland has been and remains under considerable pressure from hunters (2) (3). Despite legal prohibitions against trade in banteng law enforcement is inadequate and poaching and illegal trade in their meat and horns remains widespread (6) (7).,The banteng is legally protected across its range and occurs in a number of protected areas (1). However the natural resources of reserves often continue to be exploited with about 12 banteng poached annually for example in Baluran National Park Java (7). Several on-going field survey programmes exist (e.g. in Indochina) and a monitoring programme is conducted in East Java. A large captive population is maintained world-wide (1) with European zoos first importing captive banteng from collections in Indonesia as early as 1867 (4). Such populations provide a buffer against total extinction offer potential for future reintroductions into the wild and can be managed to maintain the genetic diversity of the species. In addition they now have a new and exciting role that utilises the very cutting edge of technology and scientific knowledge â?? cloning!

However the extent to which this threatens the species is not clear; the remote rugged habitat of breeding colonies may have limited access for these alien species (3).

Agricultural development in the form of stream channelisation and water extraction for crops is destroying the shallow and fast-flowing habitat required by this species for feeding and breeding (3). Unsustainable water extraction has caused the river to completely dry up in some areas (1).,More research needs to be undertaken on the biology of this species in particular relationships with alien predators and competitors in order to better understand how best to conserve it (3). In addition due to the specific habitat requirements of Banardâ??s rock catfish special care must be taken in conservation strategies to maintain its preferred habitat of clean fast-flowing water (3). The conservation of this species is linked with the overall management of the Olifants River system and conservation of all three <strong>endemic</strong> <em>Austroglanis</em>species is of great importance in order to maintain the functioning of the small <strong>endemic</strong> river community (3). ,invasive; ,captive breeding; ,1,1.0

94,94,Fundulus julisia,barrens topminnow ,Animalia,Chordata,Actinopterygii,Cyprinodontiformes,Cyprinodontidae,Fundulus ,Length: up to 7 cm (2),With an extremely limited distribution and an accordingly small population the Barrenâ??s topminnow is particularly vulnerable to extinction from both natural and artificial causes (3). In 1998 a drought at the pool where this species was discovered required the removal of the entire local population. The fish were housed in an artificial facility and re-released after heavy rains replenished the water (5). Along with natural incidents habitat degradation and development are also significantly affecting this species (3) (5). Perhaps the most severe threat to this species however is the introduced non-native western mosquitofish <i>Gambusia affinis</i> (6) (7). Artificially introduced to control mosquitoes by preying on the aquatic larvae this species has becomes widespread and has invaded the range of the Barrenâ??s topminnow (7). The invasive species preys on the larval and juvenile stages of Barrenâ??s topminnow resulting in catastrophic local population declines (6) (8).,Though considered endangered by the state of Tennessee the Barrenâ??s topminnow does not currently receive Federal protection (3) (5). Fortunately however concerted efforts are being made to conserve this imperilled species. In 2001 the Barrenâ??s topminnow Working Group was established which has been responsible for implementing programmes to restock the Barrenâ??s topminnow at over 24 sites throughout much of its historic range. While many restocking efforts appear to have proven successful with successful wild breeding occurring the presence of mosquitofish remains problematic (4). The group is therefore researching and implementing ways to minimise the impacts of the invasive species including the creation of barriers around one pool occupied by this species to prevent the mosquitofish from entering (4) (5). The group is also undertaking studies to determine the effects of habitat loss and degradation (4). In order to address this threat it is clear that land management practices encouraging the formation of open water habitats favoured by this species are necessary (3). ,invasive; , ,1,0.0

The species has only been found once on Inaccessible Island and on Nightingale Island the dense cover of <i>Spartina arundinaccea</i> makes it difficult to accurately estimate the population size. It is thought that <i>Agrostis trachychlaena</i> occupies a total area of less than ten square kilometres and together with its small population this makes it particularly vulnerable to extinction (1). Although thought to be naturally scarce possibly because of natural erosion of the volcanic islands and the subsequent loss of habitat potential man-made threats include the introduction of non-native plant species and fire (1). In particular introduced New Zealand flax (<i>Phormium tenax</i>) has the potential to exclude native plant species and increasing tourism on the islands means an increasing potential for future introductions of alien species (3). Non-native <strong>invertebrates</strong> including earthworms slugs and woodlice have also been introduced to Inaccessible Island with unknown effects on its ecology (3).,Both Inaccessible and Nightingale Islands are subject to management plans and Inaccessible Island was declared a Nature Reserve in 1997 (1) (3). Fieldworkers from the Tristan da Cunha Darwin Initiative Project have already undertaken measures to remove invasive New Zealand flax from the islands although frequent follow-up visits are likely to be needed to ensure the islands remain free of this and other alien plants. It will also be important to inform visitors about the risk of accidentally introducing exotic species and to take necessary precautions to prevent introductions (3) (4). Further research may be needed into <i>Agrostis trachychlaena</i> before more specific conservation measures can be put into place for this species. ,loss; , ,1,0.0

Areas of prime habitat occur in and around the Morro do Diabo State Park; however five percent of this area was flooded in the early 1980's following the construction of a hydroelectric plant (7). The remaining black lion tamarin populations have been isolated for some time and studies have shown that genetic diversity is extremely low as a result of inbreeding (7). <strong>Inbreeding depression</strong> which can reduce the fitness of the population in terms of survival reproductive capacity and growth is therefore a cause for concern in this species.,A long-term programme of conservation and environmental education targeting the black lion tamarin is underway (7). An important measure to combat the effects of inbreeding will be to allow movement of individuals between the isolated sub-populations. This can occur through <strong>translocations</strong> of individuals or by creating corridors between habitat patches to facilitate movement between populations (4). Corridors have already been planted and some translocations have occurred (7).

Importation to the U.S. for the pet trade began in the 1980s and most specimens found in pet stores today are still freshly imported from Asia (6) although there is now substantial breeding of the species in China and some of the young exported into the global pet trade may come from farms (2). Nevertheless before reaching their destination many of these turtles have had to endure poor conditions in food markets and are malnourished or develop pneumonia mouth sores or other illnesses and almost all will have parasites from which many die (6).

An estimated 60 percent of the total breeding population of around 530 000 individuals breed on the Falkland Islands and another 20 percent on South Georgia (5). The Falklands population has declined by almost a third during the last two decades most of this within a period of five years to 2001 (5). Much of this decline is blamed on an increase in long-line fishing in the surrounding seas but the black-browed albatross is at risk from this practice throughout its range. It is one of the most frequent victims of both long-line and trawler fishing in the southern hemisphere (5).,As a result of fears over its declining population the IUCN has upgraded the status of the black-browed albatross to â??Endangeredâ??

An estimated 60 percent of the total breeding population of around 530 000 individuals breed on the Falkland Islands and another 20 percent on South Georgia (5). The Falklands population has declined by almost a third during the last two decades most of this within a period of five years to 2001 (5). Much of this decline is blamed on an increase in long-line fishing in the surrounding seas but the black-browed albatross is at risk from this practice throughout its range. It is one of the most frequent victims of both long-line and trawler fishing in the southern hemisphere (5).,As a result of fears over its declining population the IUCN has upgraded the status of the black-browed albatross to â??Endangeredâ?? (1). On the basis of the losses at the birdsâ?? chief breeding sites it is calculated that it will have declined by around 65 percent during the next 65 years and by more than 50 percent throughout the rest of its range over the same period (5). ,fishing; , ,1,0.0
116,116,Pterodroma hasitata,blackcapped petrel ,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Procellariiformes,Procellariidae,Pterodroma ,Length: 40 cm (2)Wingspan: 96 cm (3),Up until the latter half of the 19th century the black-capped petrel was relatively common within its breeding range (3) (10). Around this time a burgeoning human population in the Caribbean islands and consequential habitat loss harvesting for food and predation by introduced mammals saw petrel numbers crash almost to the point of extinction. Indeed for several decades prior to the early 1960s the species appeared to have vanished completely. Fortunately in 1963 an estimated 2000 breeding pairs were discovered at the existing colonies in Haiti (7). It soon became evident however that these populations were under the same pressures that extirpated the breeding populations on other islands. By the turn of this century the estimated number of breeding pairs had declined to 1000 with a total population size of approximately 5000 birds (3). Despite increased awareness the population in Haiti is likely to continue to decline as a result of continued conversion of broadleaf forest to cropland and pasture at Parc La Visite. Sadly this downward population trend on the breeding grounds may be further exacerbated by proposals to develop oil and gas fields within petrel foraging grounds off the coast of the USA (2) (15).,Most of the known black-capped petrel breeding populations occur within La Visite National Park and Pic Macaya National Park in Haiti while Sierra de Baoruco National Park in the Dominican Republic also contains small populations (7) (8) (9) (10). However despite official park status the implementation of a sustainable conservation plan in Haitiâ??s two national parks has no measurable conservation effect due to political instability corruption absence of political will and the abject poverty of the local population who depend critically on the forest for their day-to-day survival. Given that almost the worldâ??s entire black-capped petrel breeding population occurs within these two parks ensuring their protection presents the most critical challenge to conservation efforts (16). Current proposals for Haitiâ??s National Parks include establishing core ecological reserves that are strictly off-limits to humans maintenance of defined park boundaries and long-term monitoring and research of avian populations (17) (18).

The small number of wintering sites means that the species is very vulnerable to any chance event that may occur particularly to the potentially catastrophic effects of pollution (6).,The black-faced spoonbill is protected in China Taiwan North Korea South Korea and Japan and a number of both breeding and wintering sites are protected as sanctuaries (2). An Action Plan for the species was produced in 1995 following an international workshop; the Wild Bird Society of Japan acts as the secretariat of the Black-faced Spoonbill Conservation Network (6).

Prairies have been modified for intensive agriculture and there is now less than two percent of the original ferret habitat left (3). The ferret's main prey prairie dogs were systematically poisoned in vast tracts of their habitat by a government eradication programme in the mid 1900s (5). Prairie dog burrows were thought to damage cropland and ferret numbers fell in direct proportion with the dramatic decline of their prey (3). The final threat to black-footed ferret numbers and perhaps the most pertinent today is disease particularly canine distemper and plague (3). Plague introduced to North America causes even greater devastation in populations of prairie dogs and ferrets than it caused in human populations of Europe and Asia (8).,The black-footed ferret was thought to be extinct in the 1970s until a last population was discovered in Meeteetse Wyoming in 1981 (5). Under initial protection measures this population increased in numbers but then became infected by canine distemper and plague which threatened to completely wipe out the species (5). As a last resort the final 18 wild animals were caught and brought into captivity between 1985 and 1987 and a successful captive-breeding programme has been running ever since (3) (8). The US Fish and Wildlife Service's revised 'Black-Footed Ferret Recovery Plan' of 1988 prescribed the long-term target of establishing ten or more separate self-sustaining wild populations aiming to have 1500 ferrets in the wild by 2010 (9).

The introduction of non-native fish to the lakes as a food source and for malaria control as well as the local use of poisons in fishing may also be affecting this species although the current impacts on the population are unknown (2). By far the biggest threat to Boesemanâ??s rainbowfish however is from the overharvesting of individuals for the international aquarium fish trade. The beautiful colours of this species particularly the males have made it perhaps the most popular rainbowfish in the trade with an estimated one million individuals captured from the wild each year (1) (2) (3) (5).,The Indonesian government are reported to have restricted the trade in Boesemanâ??s rainbowfish (5) but it is likely that careful controls in trade and further research into the species will be needed before its conservation status can be better known and its populations more effectively protected. ,fishing; ,protected; ,1,1.0

Although traditionally not targeted by hunters as a result of local taboos (9) this species is today at risk from the bushmeat trade; the demand for which has recently increased threatening much of Africa's wildlife (2).,Bonobos are protected by law and international trade is prohibited by their listing on Appendix I of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) (3). <strong>Ex-situ</strong> conservation measures cannot be relied upon as a safeguard for this species as presently no self-sustaining captive population exists (2). The precise impact of the bushmeat trade is currently being investigated by the Bushmeat Working Group part of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) (7). The United Nations Environmental Program (UNEP) has recently recognised the urgent need to protect our closest relatives and has established a Great Ape Survival Project (GRASP) aimed at identifying the conservation initiatives required to secure the future of the apes and obtaining political support and funding to allow these to be achieved (8). The Bonobo Conservation Initiative is working in the Democratic Republic of Congo to raise awareness of the plight of this species (9). The main problem in terms of bonobo conservation is that they are only found in a single protected area (Salonga National Park) and even there they are intensively hunted both for their meat as well as for the making of charms (3).

Five full time staff and a large team of volunteers monitor the ducks and control predators (3) (5). They also oversee a captive breeding programme and the resulting reintroductions. This programme has been extremely successful in producing captive-reared birds â?? for every bird taken from the wild 21.5 have been bred and released bringing the total number of reintroduced brown teal to 2000 since 1964 (3). Improvements in release techniques using supplementary feeders post-release and predator control at the release site has increased initial post-release survival rates to more than 60% (5). The captive breeding network in New Zealand consists of 20 holders made up of wildlife parks zoos and private individuals on a completely voluntary basis with no financial support. These collectively produce approximately 100 brown teal for release into the wild each year. This programme is now in the third year of releasing the birds into a major release site in Port Charles Coromandel which has proved very successful with 60 â?? 70 percent survival rate of released birds which are now breeding and producing young in the wild themselves (5). , ,captive breeding; ,0,1.0

A burgeoning population and rapid development along the southeastern coastal region of Brazil has taken its toll on the natural forest habitat (2) (6).  The clearance of land for coffee plantations sugar cane cocoa eucalyptus cattle pasture and most significantly timber extraction and charcoal production has left just a tiny fraction of original forest (6).  In addition this threatened primate may also be hunted for the pet trade (1).,Despite the grim picture painted for the future of the buffy-headed marmosetâ??s habitat it has been reported that this species may be able to adapt to <strong>secondary forest</strong> and that its future could be secured if provided with proper protection (2).  Currently this species is known to occur within the Nova Lombardia Biological Reserve and the forest within the lands of the Fazenda Montes Claros (a privately owned farm) (6).  This provides the buffy-headed marmoset with some protection against the threats of habitat loss but it has been advised that the land of Fazenda Montes Claros should be made into an official protected area so that its future preservation can be assured (6).  Indeed the future of the buffy-headed marmoset may rest on the effective protection of strongholds such as these (6). ,pet; ,protected; ,1,1.0

This birdâ??s extirpation from it presumed former stronghold Campbell Island has largely been attributed to predation by introduced Norway rats (<i>Rattus norvegicus</i>) that got ashore from sealing and whaling ships in the early 19th Century (4). Present-day potential threats include the accidental introduction of predators or avian disease to Dent Island the birdâ??s last natural refuge or even severe weather conditions which could have a catastrophic effect (6). Indeed with such a small current population and limited natural range this bird is now extremely vulnerable; just a single event is capable of driving it to complete extinction (5).,The outlook for the Campbell Island teal looked bleak when first rediscovered in 1975 but thankfully since then there has been fantastic progress with captive breeding programmes and the population has increased to a healthier though still unstable level (5). Captive breeding was started by New Zealandâ??s Department of Conservation in 1984 from three males and one female taken from the small population on Dent Island and another four males and three females captured in 1990. The first duckling finally hatched in 1994 at the Pukaha Mt Bruce National Wildlife Centre receiving international attention and by 2000 the captive population had reached 60 (4). The Department of Conservation initially released a total of 24 captive-bred birds on to the predator-free Codfish Island in 1999 and 2000 as an insurance population and to be eventually used to restock Campbell Island (4) (5). These had an 88 percent survival rate. With this success the Department of Conservation decided to translocate captive-bred birds directly to Campbell Island made viable by a successful rat and cat eradication programme in 2001 (4). Thus 50 teal including 28 from Pukaha Mount Bruce and 22 from Codfish Island were released onto Campbell Island in September 2004 and a further 55 in September 2005 and 54 in 2006 (4) (5). A check in February 2005 found no evidence that the first batch of released birds had bred but this may be due to their being moved close to the breeding season (4).

By 1880 the species was restricted to around ten hectares of woody vegetation on a mammal-free rock-stack known as Little Mangere Island (5). Habitat loss on this island further threatened the species however and prompted an intensive conservation programme that began in the 1970s (5). Today a population of around 250 to 300 birds exists on two small islands: Mangere and Rangatira (or South East) Islands (6). Although all are descended from just one pair and are genetically identical there are no apparent deleterious effects resulting from their small gene pool (6). The possibility of accidental predator introduction remains a threat (2).,In the 1970s habitat loss on Little Mangere Island was so severe that the population of seven birds was moved to Mangere Island.

203,203,Pterodroma axillaris,chatham petrel ,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Procellariiformes,Procellariidae,Pterodroma ,200 g (2),The main threat to the Chatham petrel is competition for burrows with the broad-billed prion (<em>Pachyptila vittata</em>) which breeds earlier in the year leaving the Chatham petrel at a competitive disadvantage (7). The broad-billed prion is also known to attack eggs chicks and occasionally adults causing burrow evictions and high rates of mortality in young Chatham petrels (10). Broad-billed prion interference has also been proposed as a contributing factor in pair bond disruption (4).,Intensive research into the reasons for the decline of the Chatham petrel in the last two decades has led to several conservation actions. Breeding burrows have been artificially blockaded to prevent occupation by the competing broad-billed prion and any prions found invading petrel burrows during absences are culled. Installation of neoprene flaps to burrow entrances has helped reduce broad-billed prion interference during the incubation period and continual burrow monitoring and artificial nest site protection has significantly improved Chatham petrel breeding success (11). ,loss;invasive;pet; ,protected; ,3,1.0

Human development and the invasion of exotic plant species have taken their toll on at least 80 percent of suitable habitat in the Coachella Valley and the remaining portion has been fragmented by roads and railways (3) (4).  Buildings and invasive plant species both stabilise the once free-moving sands preventing the continual replenishment of loose sand on which the lizard relies (3).,The Coachella Valley fringe-toed lizard is listed as threatened in the United States under the Endangered Species Act and as an endangered species by the State of California (3).  In addition to this legislation some of this lizardâ??s habitat receives much-needed protection.  In 1985 the Coachella Valley National Wildlife Refuge was established to protect the fringe-toed lizard (3) followed by the creation of the Coachella Valley Preserve which encompasses an additional area of lizard habitat adjacent to the Wildlife Refuge (6).  Few lizards now exist outside of these protected areas (1) and thus the continued existence of this refuge and preserve are essential for the survival of this rare and unique reptile. ,loss;invasive; ,protected;endangered species act; ,2,2.0

Because of their low birth rates slow reproductive turnover and sometimes restricted range stingarees are particularly susceptible to the damaging effects of over-fishing (4).,The coastal stingaree occurs in the Great Australian Bight Marine Park (GAB) within which exists a <strong>Benthic</strong> Protection Zone (BPZ) that affords some degree of protection to this bottom-dwelling species. However the Parkâ??s mission is not only to maintain current levels of biodiversity but also to provide ecologically sustainable use of marine resources. As such a number of fisheries and recreational fishing are still permitted to operate in certain areas and exploratory drilling for petroleum commenced in 2003 and further exploration activity is anticipated in the future (5). These activities may threaten the coastal stingaree and there are currently no conservation measures directly targeting the species. ,fishing; , ,1,0.0

244,244,Torreornis inexpectata,cuban sparrow ,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Emberizidae,Torreornis ,Length: 17 cm (2),The largest threat the Cuban sparrow faces is habitat degradation. Potential threats to the habitat in the Zapata region include drainage the expansion of agriculture and the associated pollution. Logging and grazing in swamps also alters the habitat to which the Cuban sparrow is adapted to (5). Subspecies <i>T.i.varonai</i> is threatened by habitat loss resulting from the expansion of the tourism industry and the cactus scrub habitat in Guantanamo is threatened by grazing felling of trees and the habitat conversion associated with increased urbanization (5).,Each of the subspecies has been recorded occurring within a protected area. For example in Zapata there is a UNESCO Biosphere Reserve a Ramsar site and also the Zapata Peninsula National Park. However the level of actual protection they offer the Cuban sparrow is variable. Increased protection to the areas they inhabit as well as investigation into proposed developments in these regions with steps taken to reduce the impact on Cuban sparrows is recommended to protect the future of this endangered bird (4). ,loss;pollution; ,protected; ,2,1.0

Numbers have been massively depleted due to overexploitation industrial and agricultural pollution deforestation (causing increased water temperatures) water redirection and badly designed or non-existent fish ladders in dams and reservoirs (2) (6). Barriers and dams are major obstacles for spawning fish and prevent genetic exchange between sub-populations (8). In addition the fishâ??s popularity with anglers as a sports fish has probably also contributed to the speciesâ?? decline (2).

Since its discovery the species has been protected with initial measures focussing on protecting individual trees rather than whole populations. Although this prevented the species from direct threats through agricultural encroachment and firewood collecting the natural habitats surrounding dawn redwood trees have been severely degraded. In place of natural forests with a diversity of tree species forests dominated by dawn redwood trees have arisen. This has had the adverse affect of providing ideal conditions for insect pest species to thrive while the largest oldest trees are more vulnerable to lightening strikes (8). ,With a small population and a highly fragmented distribution the survival of the dawn redwood is dependant upon the successful implementation of conservation measures (1). Recognising this the Chinese government gave the dawn redwood protected status in 1980 while <strong>ex-situ</strong> nurseries have also been established with the aim of increasing the speciesâ?? <strong>genetic diversity</strong> (9) (10). A number of reserves have been created to protect the remaining trees and it has been recommended that the largest and oldest trees should receive additional protection. It has also been recommended that the natural plant communities that were original associated with this species should be restored and that lightening conductors should be attached to the largest trees (8) (11).    ,pollution; ,protected; ,1,1.0

In the absence of catch limits the single most significant threat to this species is unsustainable collection for the pet trade. It has declined at an alarming rate of around 70 percent since 2004 and is now reduced to highly fragmented relict populations (1) (3) (4) (8).,A conservation priority for the recovery of the Denison barb is to reduce the number of fish caught in fisheries as at present this is likely unsustainable. The Government of Kerala has introduced regulations for catch limits and restrictions on the use of fishing gear while plans have been developed for designated no-take zones and specific Denison barb sanctuaries. The listing of the species on Indiaâ??s National Wildlife Protection Act should also ensure that trade is carefully regulated (7). ,fishing;pet; , ,2,0.0

Worryingly it appears that this species may be sensitive to even slight disturbances as it has vanished from areas which have suffered only a little degradation (2). This species is also hunted for food an activity which is having a serious detrimental impact even on populations that lie within supposedly protected areas (1).,The diademed sifaka occurs in a number of national parks and reserves for example Mantadia and Zahamena National Parks but unfortunately this does not always offer the species protection from the threat of hunting (1). A conservation action plan for lemurs compiled in 1992 stated that better protection of such areas is a necessary conservation action for this species (8). The plan also suggested that a captive breeding programme should be developed (8); for many years there has only been one male diademed sifaka held in captivity in Duke Lemur Centre in North Carolina USA (9). , ,captive breeding; ,0,1.0

It is not known why this marsupial is so rare although surveys suggest various factors. Land clearing and habitat fragmentation are thought to be significant causes of its decline. In addition the frequent burning of heathland and litter may reduce the availability of invertebrates in the area. Predation by introduced mammals such as foxes and cats are also considered a threat to this species (4).,In 1992 a recovery plan for this species was developed by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources (IUCN) addressing the threats facing this species (4). Predation by foxes and cats has now been brought under control by The Department of Conservation and Land Management (CALM) and in the last decade dibbler numbers have started to increase (5). Perth Zoo has been working with CALM to establish a captive breeding stock of over 100 individuals of this species (6). They have also translocated a group of dibblers to Escape Island; a predator free island which has suitable habitat for this marsupial. Here radio tracking devices and trapping practices will be used to monitor the populations (5).

Over-fishing and spearfishing have caused a dramatic decline in numbers over the last few decades leaving dusky grouper populations seriously depleted mainly in the north-western Mediterranean (5). The slow growth rate late onset of maturity and complex reproductive biology of this species compound these threats by making it harder for it to withstand or recover from high fishing pressure (1). The fact that it also forms <strong>spawning</strong> aggregations combined with its large size makes this fish particularly easy to catch and therefore vulnerable to over-harvesting (1). Indeed despite insufficient data from many range countries alarming declines have been recorded in Europe and the Mediterranean (mainly north-western) and there are also reports that <strong>spawning</strong> aggregations are being specifically targeted in Brazil (1).,Spearfishing of this species has been banned since 1993 in France (Mediterranean coast only) with evidence of small recoveries in this area (1).

289,289,Encephalartos horridus,eastern cape blue cycad ,Plantae,Tracheophyta,Cycadopsida,Cycadales,Zamiaceae,Encephalartos ,Stem length: up to 1 m (2),Over the past few decades many South African cycads have become increasingly scarce in the wild with many species now facing the very real threat of extinction. Various factors account for their decline but the main threats include illegal harvesting for horticulture food and medicine habitat loss and the spread of alien vegetation (10). Although once abundant the Eastern Cape blue cycad has suffered significant declines due to heavy harvesting of wild specimens while urban development has destroyed several populations (2) (5) (10).,There are not known to be any specific conservation measures in place for this Endangered species but like all South African cycads the Eastern Cape blue cycad is partially protected by its listing on Appendix I of CITES which permits trade only under exceptional circumstances (3). In addition on account of its increasing prevalence in nurseries and private collections there is no longer such a strong incentive to poach this species from the wild (5) (6). ,loss; ,cites;protected; ,1,2.0

In Africa declines have been caused by the loss of wild <strong>ungulate</strong> populations and in some areas overgrazing by livestock (5).  In Europe the Egyptian vulture has been suffering severe long-term declines; the result of disturbance lead poisoning from gun shot direct poisoning and electrocution by powerlines as well as regulations introduced within the European Union to control the disposal of animal carcasses which have greatly reduced food availability for this scavenger.  In addition Avian pox has been cited as the cause of Egyptian vulture deaths in Bulgaria (5).  In India diclofenac an anti-inflammatory drug often used for livestock is likely to be the source of recent and extremely rapid declines in Egyptian vulture populations (5) (7).  This drug which is also responsible for devastating declines in other vulture species poisons vultures when they feed on the flesh of treated livestock (8).,Throughout its range the Egyptian vulture occurs in a number of protected areas as well as being the subject of monitoring supplementary feeding programmes and campaigns against the illegal use of poisons (5).  In 2006 manufacture of the veterinary form of the drug diclofenac was banned by the Indian Nepali and Pakistani governments (9) (10).  While this was a remarkable step forward in vulture conservation the drug remains widely available and the human form of the drug is sometimes being used to treat livestock instead (9).    Many more measures may be necessary if the long-term survival of the Egyptian vulture is to be assured.

292,292,Pyrrhura orcesi,el oro parakeet ,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Psittaciformes,Psittacidae,Pyrrhura ,Length: 22 cm (2),Deforestation associated with logging and clearance of trees for agriculture is a huge threat to the survival of the El Oro Parakeet. Although high altitude <strong>cloud forest</strong> is being deforested at a much slower rate this species is largely restricted to the more accessible lower altitude forest (2) (7). As habitat becomes more and more fragmented so the sub-populations are becoming more and more isolated and vulnerable. In 2006 the total population of El Oro parakeets was estimated to be less than 1000 birds (2).,In the past decade around 1500 hectares of forest has been acquired by the Jocotoco Foundation at Buenaventura the locality in which the El Oro parakeet was first discovered (2) (7) (8). Now known as the Buenaventura Reserve it is one of the richest ornithological regions of Ecuador and the only well protected site in which the El Oro parakeet occurs (7) (8). Approximately 80 El Oro parakeets are year-round occupants of the reserve but at certain times of the year the total number rises to around 120 (7) (9). The long-term aim is to expand the reserve to 5000 hectares and implement an environmental awareness campaign that will encourage and engage local people in conservation (2) (7) (8). , ,protected; ,0,1.0

In particular Eldâ??s deer are thought to have been hunted to feed the armies during many Asian wars (10). They are a prized game animal because of their impressive antlers and hides which are sold in the local markets (6). Habitat destruction due to expanding agriculture has also had a major impact on this rare species. In Manipur the Manipur brow-antlered deer (<i>R. e. eldii</i>) population has declined primarily due to wetland reclamation for grazing cultivation and fish farming (6). Very little suitable habitat is protected; only one percent of the protected forests in Southeast Asia are suitable for Eldâ??s deer (11). Even within protected areas these threats continue. The Chatthin Wildlife Sanctuary Myanmar is one of the last strongholds of the species yet the <strong>dipterocarp</strong> forest within it continues to be degraded under great pressure from local communities for cropland and timber (7). Sadly there is often a lack of funding and political will for protection (12). Due to their highly fragmented distribution this species is also at risk from <strong>inbreeding</strong> and loss of genetic variation (12).,Eldâ??s deer occur in a number of protected areas throughout its range.

When these were gone the forests were replaced with plantations of bananas coconuts rubber and tea (7). After centuries of agriculture Sangihe has now been almost entirely stripped of forest and only tiny patches remain (6) (8). Naturally this has had a great impact on the islandâ??s wildlife including the elegant sunbird.,Action Sampiri a UK-based conservation group has been working to promote wildlife conservation on Sangihe since 1995 by conducting fieldwork running education and awareness programmes and developing ideas for future land-use that may be mutually beneficial to the local people and wildlife (2). The <strong>primary forest</strong> fragment at Mount Sahendaruman is nominally protected although action is limited (2) and forest in the Kentuhang valley also receives some protection as part of a <strong>watershed</strong> for a hydroelectric scheme (2). Improved effective protection of the forest at Mount Sahendaruman has been recommended (2) a measure that would not only help the elegant sunbird but also the other highly threatened species clinging to existence in this tiny patch of forest.  , ,protected; ,0,1.0

Intensive hunting in some areas especially Sumatra in the mid 20th Century also contributed greatly to the decline in population numbers (3). Further threats come from fishing practices with false gharials either becoming caught in nets poisoned by toxins used to kill fish or else loosing their food source to local fishermen (2).,International trade in the false gharial is prevented by its listing on Appendix I of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) (1) and many of the known populations occur within protected areas (3). Recent population estimates of the false gharial are under 2500 mature adults but data on distribution is still insufficient (2). Before a successful conservation management plan can be implemented more information needs to be collected on the current status of this species in Malaysia and Indonesia.

313,313,Tomistoma schlegelii,false gharial ,Animalia,Chordata,Reptilia,Crocodylia,Crocodylidae,Tomistoma ,Male length: at least 5 m (2),Habitat destruction caused by the construction of dams channelling and deforestation amongst others has been the main cause of the decline of this species and continues to be its main threat to this day (3). Intensive hunting in some areas especially Sumatra in the mid 20th Century also contributed greatly to the decline in population numbers (3). Further threats come from fishing practices with false gharials either becoming caught in nets poisoned by toxins used to kill fish or else loosing their food source to local fishermen (2).,International trade in the false gharial is prevented by its listing on Appendix I of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) (1) and many of the known populations occur within protected areas (3). Recent population estimates of the false gharial are under 2500 mature adults but data on distribution is still insufficient (2). Before a successful conservation management plan can be implemented more information needs to be collected on the current status of this species in Malaysia and Indonesia. Further research into behaviour and ecology must be carried out in order to identify priority habitats and population needs (3).

There have also been very successful captive breeding programmes of this species with the Fear-No-More Zoo in Fiji having successfully bred the species for the last fifteen years (9) and the San Diego Zoo in the U.S. having produced over 100 offspring since 1965 (10). , ,captive breeding; ,0,1.0

Between 1935 and 1965 over 30000 individuals were killed every year (7). At present there is evidence of man-made injuries to fin whales many of which have resulted from collisions with boats (9). Like other large whales they are also threatened by environmental change including noise and chemical pollution (10).,In 1985 the International Whaling Commission (IWC) banned the hunting of all whales by signatory states. The IWC regulates the International Convention for the Regulation of Whaling (1946) and also provides scientific advice to signatory states (11). Conservationists are worried however that these protection measures are a case of 'too little too late' the southern hemisphere is thought to support only 5000 fin whales and the northern seas hold just 2 to 3000 individuals (4). It seems likely that the species may never recover from past over-exploitation. ,hunting;environmental;environment;pollution; , ,4,0.0

In 1992 only 15 percent of Florida scrubland remained (6). Many populations of the Florida perforate reindeer lichen are found on high-value real estate making their long-term survival unlikely without any protection (1). Land conversion to citrus plantations and residential development continues to diminish scrub habitat almost daily (2). ,In 1993 the Florida perforate reindeer lichen earned the distinction of being the first lichen to be placed on the U.S. Endangered Species List (7). This means that all landowners of state land with populations of this species are responsible for its protection and conservation. Additionally the state of Florida has an active conservation program which monitors listed species such as the Florida perforate reindeer lichen and works to conserve them through land acquisition and management. Under this programme at least two sites at Lake Wales Ridge have been purchased for conservation purposes (1).  ,loss; ,protected; ,1,1.0

Since European colonisation over 50 percent of white gum forest in the south east region of Tasmania has been cleared and on private land clearing still continues. The impact of woodland fragmentation on the forty-spotted pardalote is particularly damaging as the bird is not capable of long-distance dispersal and thus colonies quickly become isolated from each other (3). Wildfires which kill canopy trees and restrict regeneration of young trees pose an additional threat and it is feared that fires that swept through Flinders Island in 2002 may have severely damaged the remaining colonies found there (2) (3). Aside from habitat loss there is concern that aggressive birds such as the noisy miner (<i>Manorina melanocephala</i>) are invading forty-spotted pardalote habitat where it has been opened up by disturbance and clearance and subsequently are outcompeting this species for resources (3).,The preservation of white gum woodlands and forests is critical to the survival of the forty-spotted pardalote (3). Fortunately around 60 percent of the habitat currently occupied is protected within reserves including the most significant breeding colony on Bruny Island (2). A recovery plan which ran from 1991 to 1997 was instrumental in increasing the amount of protected habitat as well as in locating new colonies planting white gum seedlings to create new habitat and raising public awareness. The current stability of the forty-pardalote population at around 3800 birds in 2008 is evidence of the success of the original recovery plan but because it still has a very small and fragmented range the species remains classified as Endangered on the IUCN Red List (1) (2) (3). A new four-year recovery plan implemented in 2006 has the central aim of improving the conservation status of the forty-spotted pardalote sufficiently to warrant it being down-listed to Vulnerable. In order to achieve this the plan intends to enhance and expand existing habitat to assist in the colonisation of potential habitat and to conduct research that will help to identify and respond to threats restricting the current population (3). ,loss;fragmentation;pet; ,protected; ,3,1.0

In particular an increase in agricultural land and logging for both timber and fuel wood has reduced the area available to this species. It has also been extensively hunted for food and for use in traditional â??medicinalâ?? preparations. Part of the range of Francoisâ?? langur was heavily bombed during the Vietnam War killing individuals as well as damaging and defoliating their habitat (2) (8).,The development and maintenance of reserves is crucial to the survival of this species and combating hunting through the implementation of a ranger system in areas of sanctuary would also be of value. Educating consumers of traditional â??medicinesâ?? derived from threatened species would not only impact positively on Francoisâ?? langur but on many other endangered species (8).

The causes of this decline are not fully understood but alteration and degradation of its freshwater habitat undoubtedly plays a central role (4).  The negative impacts humans have on rivers and streams come from a wide range of activities such as river regulation drainage sewage disposal dredging and water pollution including the introduction of excess nutrients (4).  Anything that affects the abundance of the fish hosts will also affect the freshwater pearl mussel; for example the introduction of exotic fish species such as the rainbow trout reduces the number of native fish hosts (4).  Introduced species are also directly affecting the freshwater pearl mussel; the invasion of the zebra mussel (<i>Dreissena polymorpha</i>) which has been spread to new locations by being transported on the bottom of boats or in ballast waters has impacted freshwater pearl mussel populations in all countries it has invaded (4).,The freshwater pearl mussel which is completely protected in most European countries (8) has been the focus of a significant amount of conservation efforts (9).  Measures have included the transfer of adult mussels to areas where it had gone extinct (9) (10) the culture of juvenile mussels and the release of juvenile trout which have been infected with glochidia into small rivers (10) but mainly the freshwater pearl mussel has benefited from habitat restoration projects in some areas (10).  Due to the essential role salmonid fish play in the life of the freshwater pearl mussel the conservation of salmon and trout is also central in the survival of this endangered freshwater mussel (4). ,pollution; ,protected; ,1,1.0

Spores of this disease can be spread in the water on wet equipment and on fish (2). Competition with introduced crayfish species has also affected our native crayfish (3); signal crayfish were first introduced to the UK in the 1970s and are now naturalised and breeding (2). Two other introduced species have become established (3); the narrow-clawed (or Turkish) crayfish (<i>Astacus leptodactylus</i>) and the noble crayfish (<i>Astacus astacus</i>) (2). Pollution and river works are also likely to have affected the species (2).,The freshwater white-clawed crayfish has been targeted as a priority for conservation under the UK Biodiversity Action Plan (UK BAP). The Species Action Plan aims to maintain the current distribution of the species through a combination of restricting the spread of non-native crayfish and crayfish plague as well as providing suitable habitat features (3). The Environment Agency has carried out research into potential methods of controlling the signal crayfish and is currently investigating the use of pheromones to lure this introduced species into traps (5). It is an offence under Schedule 9 of the Wildlife and Countryside Act to release the three introduced species of crayfish into the wild (3). ,disease;pet;pollution; , ,3,0.0

With the cessation of hostilities in 2002 pressure on the forest will again increase as demand for agricultural land grows (4).  A growth in subsistence agriculture now poses the greatest threat to the Gabela akalat and other forest-dwelling birds of the region (2) (4).  In some areas 20 to 70 percent of canopy trees and all the undergrowth in valley bottoms are being cleared to plant bananas and sweet potatoes.  In other areas up to 95 percent of the forest canopy is being removed to plant cassava and maize (2).  In addition the re-establishment of coffee plantations would also have serious impacts on the Gabela akalat particularly if varieties that require shade (which thrive beneath the canopy of forests) were replaced by sun-tolerant varieties (which results in the destruction of the forest canopy) (4).,For the duration of the protracted civil war very little scientific research was undertaken in Angola.  Since the war was formally ended in 2002 surveys to determine the Gabela akalatâ??s population size and distribution could now be carried out (2).  Ascertaining the call of this shy bird would be extremely useful in any future surveys that are undertaken; in 2004 a group of scientists first recorded a call emanating from the location of a Gabela akalat but more work is needed to confirm its repertoire (4).

In other areas up to 95 percent of the forest canopy is being removed to plant cassava and maize (2).  In addition the re-establishment of coffee plantations would also have serious impacts on the Gabela akalat particularly if varieties that require shade (which thrive beneath the canopy of forests) were replaced by sun-tolerant varieties (which results in the destruction of the forest canopy) (4).,For the duration of the protracted civil war very little scientific research was undertaken in Angola.  Since the war was formally ended in 2002 surveys to determine the Gabela akalatâ??s population size and distribution could now be carried out (2).  Ascertaining the call of this shy bird would be extremely useful in any future surveys that are undertaken; in 2004 a group of scientists first recorded a call emanating from the location of a Gabela akalat but more work is needed to confirm its repertoire (4).  The bird conservation organisation BirdLife International also recommends that the forest at Gabela should be designated as a protected area (2). , ,protected; ,0,1.0
340,340,Laniarius amboimensis,gabela bush shrike ,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Malaconotidae,Laniarius ,Length: 20 cm (2),Most of the forest the Gabela bush-shrike inhabits was selectively logged before the 27-year-long Angolan civil war started in 1975 and although there is no evidence of ongoing logging the forest continues to be a source of firewood for local people and is cleared to make way for subsistence agriculture (2) (4) (7). In some parts of its habitat 20 to 70 percent of canopy trees and all the undergrowth in valley bottoms is being cleared to plant bananas and sweet potatoes. In other areas up to 95 percent of the forest canopy is being removed to plant cassava and maize (8). While the Gabela bush-shrike is said to be fairly tolerant of degraded habitats (4) (7) numbers of this species are still believed to have declined over recent years (2).,The protection of a 50 square kilometre area inhabited by the Gabela bush-shrike was recommended in the early 1970s (8) as it is home to several endangered birds (4) but this has not yet been established (8). The creation of a protected area to ensure the survival of the Gabela bush-shrike remains a priority and a number of other conservation measures have also been recommended. These include conducting surveys to determine the Gabela bush-shrikeâ??s distribution and population size and studies to determine the speciesâ?? habitat requirements. To address the issue of land-use change for farming ecotourism has been suggested as a viable addition to agriculture (2). , ,protected; ,0,1.0

Charcoal production is claiming large tracts of dry forest near the escarpment while other areas are being cleared to plant subsistence agricultural crops such as bananas sweet potato maize and cassava. In addition now that conflict has ended on the escarpment large-scale coffee planting and farming is now likely to resume claiming more of this imperilled birdâ??s habitat (2).,The Gabela helmet-shrike is found in the Kissama National Park which affords a degree of protection against habitat destruction (2). Unfortunately however a proposal to create another protected area the Gabela Nature Reserve which would have helped to protect this species against the resumption of commercial activities on the escarpment has not materialised (2) (5). In order to ensure this speciesâ?? survival surveys of its population and habitat should be conducted along with research into its ecology.

By the early 20th century the Galapagos fur seal was believed to be extinct until a small colony was discovered in 1932-33 (8). Since then and following the end of extensive seal hunting (3) numbers have increased substantially (8) and the Galapagos fur seal is no longer exploited (2).,The Galapagos fur seal is fully protected by the Galapagos National Park Service under Ecuadorean law (2). It will also benefit from the management of the Galapagos Islands and the surrounding waters as a national park and marine reserve (5) (10). As one of the first sites to be designated a Natural World Heritage Site (10) the recognition of the Galapagosâ?? incredible and unique ecosystem will hopefully ensure the preservation of the islandsâ?? fauna and flora for generations to come. ,hunting; ,protected; ,1,1.0

346,346,Progne modesta,galapagos martin ,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Hirundinidae,Progne ,Size: 15 cm (2),With a dangerously small population thought to total fewer than 1000 individuals and possibly fewer than 600 the Galapagos martin faces an uncertain future. Furthermore no more than 50 birds have been recorded at any one site. The population is likely to have declined over the last 200 years probably as a result of introduced diseases parasites and nest predators (e.g. rats <i>Rattus</i>) but current population trends and threats are unknown (3).,There are currently no known conservation measures underway to protect this bird. Due to a lack of data there is an urgent need for surveys throughout its range to determine accurate population estimates and trends. Research into the reasons for the birdâ??s small population and possible decline is also needed. The information gained from such studies could help guide appropriate conservation measures in the future and hopefully help secure for this rare native bird a more certain and prosperous future (3). ,disease; , ,1,0.0
347,347,Spheniscus mendiculus,galapagos penguin ,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Sphenisciformes,Spheniscidae,Spheniscus ,Length: 53 cm (2),The main threat facing this unique penguin is the increasing frequency of ENSO events which reduce the strength of the cool currents this species needs to survive and causes fluctuations in its prey (6). The 1982-1983 ENSO resulted in the catastrophic loss of 77 percent of the Galapagos penguin population through starvation. A slow period of recovery followed but the 1997-1998 ENSO resulted in another precipitous population crash of 66 percent. Such events may have a disproportionate affect on females which can skew the sex ratio and make recovery from population crashes even slower (2). Furthermore during periods of food shortages the Galapagos penguin forages individually and makes no attempt to breed until sea temperatures decrease once again (4). ,All populations of the Galapagos penguin occur within the Galapagos National Park and Marine Reserve. At present all populations are closely monitored and feral animals are controlled (2).  ,loss; , ,1,0.0

In the 19th century sea-lions worldwide were hunted for their meat skin and oil. The hunting of some sea-lions including the Galapagos species has now been banned and populations have recovered (2). Galapagos sea lions are still vulnerable to human activity as their inquisitive and social nature means they are more likely to approach areas inhabited by humans. This brings them into contact with fishing nets hooks and human waste all of which can be fatal (6). There are also problems resulting from the increase in numbers of deep-water tuna and billfish fisheries as these sea-lions become victims of <strong>bycatch</strong> (7). Research indicates that the majority of these incidents (67 percent) involve juveniles probably due to their more curious and playful nature (7).,The Galapagos sea lion occurs in one of the most biologically diverse areas of the world. The Galapagos Islands have long been studied and protected and were influential in the formulation of Darwinâ??s theory of evolution by natural selection. Most recently in March 1998 a 133000 square kilometres area was designated as the Galapagos Marine Reserve making it one of the worldâ??s largest protected areas. Detailed conservation and research programmes have been developed which focus on studying the islandsâ?? ecology the effects of environmental fluctuations on species and the effects of humans on wildlife. These measures have to some extent protected this sea lion especially from hunting. The Charles Darwin Research Centre has implemented an ecological monitoring project of the Galapagos sea-lion to determine the state and abundance of the sea lions. This project also studies the ongoing threats to this mammal and has developed simple rescue methods for injured or caught sea lions. Elsewhere in the world sea lions are suffering dramatic population declines for unknown reasons and so conservation measures like these which both monitor and protect the sea lion are invaluable in the future of the Galapagos sea lion (7). ,hunting;fishing;disease; ,protected; ,3,1.0

It has been reported that three hunters in the Western Amazon killed over 200 woolly monkeys in a little less than two years resulting in their local extinction (11) illustrating the devastating effect that hunting may have on this species. Deforestation is also a serious problem for Geoffroyâ??s woolly monkey (1); forest is cleared to make way for agricultural land and in the south of its range as a result of mining for cassiterite (a mineral that is the chief source of tin) (11). ,Luckily many of the areas in which Geoffroyâ??s woolly monkey occurs are now protected within National Parks.

This habitat loss has been the result of indiscriminate urban and agricultural development and unfortunately the geometric tortoise has proved to be intolerant of habitat modification (4) (12).  The <strong>fynbos biome</strong> and <strong>renosterveld</strong> vegetation is adapted to fire but too frequent unplanned and uncontrolled fires can result in local extinction of the geometric tortoise (4) (8).  In addition the spread of invasive alien vegetation in the region competes with and excludes important food items (8).  The geometric tortoise is occasionally eaten by farm workers and in the past it has been much sought after for the pet trade.  However the impact of these activities is negligible compared to the major threat of habitat degradation and destruction (4).,The geometric tortoise is protected by Western Cape Provincial legislation which is rigidly and effectively enforced (4) and it is listed on Appendix I of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) meaning that trade in this species is only permitted in exceptional circumstances (3).  In addition around 75 percent of the total population exists in formal protected areas (4) such as the Elandsberg Private Nature Reserve and a number of smaller provincial reserves (8).  However the majority of remaining geometric tortoise habitat is in the hands of private landowners and efforts are being made to secure the future of some of these sites through a conservation stewardship programme (13).  Captive breeding of the geometric tortoise has had limited success and is currently not considered a priority thus the primary focus of conservation efforts is to ensure its continued survival in the wild (4).  The continued enforcement of conservation legislation and vigilance towards the unscrupulous collection of animals for the pet trade is called for (2) while the maintenance of protected areas is essential.  In addition it is imperative that private landowners take custodianship of the last remaining <strong>renosterveld</strong> remnants that contain geometric tortoise populations in partnership with conservation agencies since it is practically not possible to buy enough land to protect formally (2).

Occasionally specimens will still turn up in a local market (5) but the pet trade now has relatively little impact on numbers (2). Further more captive breeding in zoos and subsequent <strong>re-introductions</strong> have literally helped save this species from extinction so its former collection for zoos has also had a very positive impact (2).,Fortunately the golden lion tamarin has been the subject of a large-scale determined conservation effort.

At the same time with high demand for this species in the caged-bird trade illegal trapping continues apace (10). Sadly it is also hunted for food feathers and sport and to reduce damage to crops (2).,The golden parakeet is protected by Brazilian law and since 1973 has been listed under Appendix I of the Convention on International in Endangered Species (CITES) which permits trade in this species only under exceptional circumstances (2) (3). Unfortunately the human and financial resources available to prevent wildlife exploitation are limited and consequently illegal trapping remains prolific and many birds continue to be smuggled out of Brazil (6) (10). There is a population of golden parakeet in the fairly well protected TapajÃ³s National Park but reserves can be limited in their effectiveness because of this speciesâ?? nomadic behaviour (2). There is cause for optimism however as in 2001 the Golden Conure Survival Fund was established (4) (8).

This species is extremely vulnerable to any habitat loss due to its range already being very restricted.,Golden-backed mountain-tanagers occur within the Rio Abiseo National Park which is also a UNESCO World Heritage Site which offers a number of tanagers a degree of protection (4). However at present there are no known conservation measures in place aimed directly at this spectacular rare bird. ,loss; , ,1,0.0

As a result of deforestation and hunting populations all over the Philippines have declined considerably and this species has vanished entirely from a number of islands (5).  The natural habitat of the Philippines is amongst the most threatened in the world with only six to seven percent of the original <strong>primary forest</strong> remaining largely due to extensive commercial logging (8).  This undoubtedly has had a significant impact on the golden-capped fruit bat which favours <strong>primary forest</strong> (5).,While the golden-capped fruit bat is thought to occur in some protected areas (5) further action is urgently needed to prevent the extinction of this species.  In 1992 an action plan developed for the conservation of Old World fruit bats outlined a number of conservation measures recommended for this species.  Due to the problems with enforcing any hunting controls the plan recommended that the most effective method of protection would be to manage colonies on small islands where suitable habitat remains and where protection efforts would have a better chance of success (5).  In 2003 the Philippine Endemic Species Conservation Project implemented a programme for the protection of the golden-capped fruit bat on the tiny island of Boracay off the northwest corner of Panay.

The speciesâ?? rather restricted habitat requirements and small breeding range make it particularly vulnerable to habitat loss (4) (10) and ongoing fragmentation of the remaining habitat also creates further problems by isolating populations and so reducing <strong>gene flow</strong> between them potentially leading to a loss of genetic diversity. It also decreases nesting success at forest edges and potentially increases predation as well as <strong>brood parasitism</strong> by the brown-headed cowbird (<i>Molothrus ater</i>) (2) (3) (4) (6). In addition habitat disturbance may decrease juniper-oak regeneration through disease and increased browsing pressure and the woodlands may take decades to recover from disturbance if at all (2) (7). Where juniper has instead spread often due to fire suppression and overgrazing it generally lacks the hardwood trees that the golden-cheeked warbler also requires (6).,In 1990 the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service listed the golden-cheeked warbler as Endangered (5) and the species is also listed as Endangered by the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department (12). A recovery plan put in place in the United States in 1992 called for the protection of sufficient breeding and non-breeding habitat the allowance of <strong>gene flow</strong> between warbler populations and the protection and management of all existing populations on public land (8).

Their habitat is one of the first to be cleared because they live in lowland forests. Currently only 2-5% of its original habitat remains (3) the rest being removed for timber or charcoal and to make way for plantations cattle pasture and industry (7). Eastern and South-eastern Brazil was also one of the first areas to be colonised almost 500 years ago and is now one of the most densely inhabited areas in Brazil exerting huge pressures on the landâ??s resources (5) (8). Critically low numbers in the wild are due almost exclusively to habitat loss (2). This primate also suffers losses because of natural predators such as ocelots snakes hawks and eagles. In addition this species has suffered from trade as its amazing appearance makes it a prize pet and very popular in zoos (7) (9). However captive breeding in zoos and subsequent reintroductions have also helped save this species from extinction so its former collection for zoos has also had a very positive impact (2). Since it has been listed as Endangered by the IUCN and hunting and trade of the species has been banned (1) (4) it is hoped that hunting no longer poses a threat though sadly there are still occasional reports of illegal trade in this species (7). Deforestation and habitat loss however are more difficult problems to solve (6).,In the 1970s the numbers of these monkeys in zoos were declining as fast as those in the wild (5) (7). At this time researchers from the National Zoological Park in Washington DC developed techniques for successfully breeding this species in captivity and created a conservation plan to implement genetic and demographic management of the captive population involving long term studies of the species educating local communities about conservation efforts and increasing the extent of protected habitats (5). ,loss;hunting;pet; ,captive breeding;protected; ,3,2.0

405,405,Psephotus chrysopterygius,goldenshouldered parrot ,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Psittaciformes,Psittacidae,Psephotus ,54 â?? 56 g (3),The golden-shouldered parrot has a small restricted and decreasing range (2) suffering principally from predation possibly in combination with a shortage of food in the early wet season. (8). Both threats have come about as a result of a change in fire regime in combination with cattle grazing (8). Fire is a feature of their natural environment and the parrots are a fire-dependent species with fire maintaining their habitat and the availability of essential foods (9). A lack of burning or burning at the wrong time of year in association with cattle grazing which has reduced fuel loads has resulted in the invasion of woodland throughout the speciesâ?? former range. The increase in woody vegetation is thought to have favoured predators such as the pied butcherbird (<i>Cracticus nigrogularis</i>). Predation of adults is a major cause of nest failure with almost one third of nests losing one or more adults (2). The shortage of food that occurs annually during the wet season may be made worse by the lack of early wet season burning and selective grazing by introduced cattle of early-seeding perennial grasses (7) (5). In addition feral pigs preferentially eat the same important grass species and reduce recruitment of the termite mounds used for nesting (7). Intensive conservation efforts have stemmed the long-term decline of the golden-shouldered parrot in closely monitored sites but in less well-monitored sites the population is probably still declining (1) (7).,Golden-shouldered parrots have been studied in detail for over 16 years and during this time land and fire management have been adjusted across much of its range to suit the parrotâ??s ecological requirements (9). Over these years completed or current management actions include analysis of threats changing fire regimes vegetation change annual monitoring and supplementary feeding of the Artemis Station population and surveys of populations and nests in the remainder of the birdâ??s range. Other actions include fencing and implementation of favourable fire regimes on leasehold land and National Parks signing of a conservation agreement with land-holders and inclusion of conservation requirements for the species in property planning in central Cape York Peninsula (2). As a result of these measures the birdâ??s range which contracted greatly between 1992 and 1998 may now have stabilized (9). A small proportion of the parrotâ??s range occurs inside the Staaten River National Park and reintroductions into Mungkan Kandju National Park are also planned (9). It has been advocated that future conservation efforts focus on providing supplementary food during the wet-season developing and refining a pastoral management strategy and securing land under conservation agreements (2). It has been estimated that around 1500 golden-shouldered parrots are held in captivity in Australia (3) with considerable numbers bred in captivity each season (6). A sustainable future for this bird in captivity is therefore safeguarded ensuring that this beautiful parrot is with us for a long time to come (6).

Dwindling habitat is also a major cause for concern with forest having been destroyed due to logging mining oil exploration and agriculture. Lowland rainforest has undergone extensive clearance and those populations still surviving in highland forest have been fragmented and isolated markedly limiting their opportunity for out-breeding (3).,Its occurrence in a reasonable number of National Parks and reserves has helped ensure the survival of Goodfellowâ??s tree kangaroo as has the almost complete lack of any large tree-climbing predators or competitors (3).

Any remaining natural forest is highly fragmented. However the forests on the slope of Mount Karthala are not very suitable for agriculture and therefore may be spared this fate (5). Introduced species may also pose a threat; rats are known to be abundant within forests on Grand Comoro Island and may predate the nests of the drongo (2). As the Grand Comoro drongo is found only surrounding an active volcano a volcanic eruption could potentially have devastating consequences for this bird.,A protected area has been proposed for Mount Karthala but this has not yet been established (5).

414,414,Adansonia grandidieri,grandidiers baobab ,Plantae,Tracheophyta,Magnoliopsida,Malvales,Bombacaceae,Adansonia ,Height: 25 m (2)Diameter: 3 m (2),<i>Adansonia grandidieri</i> is the most heavily exploited of all the Malagasy baobabs (2).  The seeds and the vitamin C-rich fruit pulp are eaten fresh and cooking oil is extracted from the oil-rich seeds.  The fruit is either collected from the ground or wooden pegs are hammered into the trunk so the tree can be climbed to collect the fruit (2).  The thick bark of the baobab is composed of tough long fibres that can be used to make ropes and the majority of trees bear scars from where the bark was cut from ground level to about two meters to obtain this material (2).  The spongy wood is comprised of sheets of fibre that are collected from dead or living trees dried in the sun and sold for thatch (2).  Most of these varied uses do not involve the tree being killed and thus are unlikely to pose a great threat to the baobab.  The greatest threat to this species has come from the transformation of its forest habitat into agricultural land.  Within these disturbed habitats there is a noticeable lack of young trees.  Fires seed predation competition from weeds and an altered physical environment might be affecting the ability of the Madagacar baobab to reproduce (2) which may have devastating consequences for its survival.,Numerous non-governmental organisations and scientists along with the Malagasy government realise the importance of conserving the unique biodiversity of Madagascar and are working to protect this magnificent island and its diverse fauna and flora (4).  One measure from which Grandidierâ??s baobab is likely to benefit is the designation of protected areas.

By the middle of the 1980s just 4.7 percent of the original forest cover remained (4). Hunting disturbance by humans and trade are also believed to have played a part in the decline (4). Deforestation continued illegally in Thailand throughout the 1990s and several Gurneyâ??s pitta <strong>territories</strong> were destroyed as a result (4).,A wildlife sanctuary was established in 1993 but much of the habitat of Gurney's pitta was excluded. In 1990 the Khao Nor Chuchi Lowland Forest project was established this is a socio-economic community-level conservation and development project the aims of which are diverse. Achievements include the creation of more wildlife friendly areas amongst a mosaic of cultivation tree planting supporting forest protection workers and promoting sustainable agriculture (4). However difficulties have plagued the project. It is clear that unless drastic action is taken and the crucial 30 kilometre squared area of suitable habitat is completely protected soon this species will become extinct (4). ,hunting; ,protected; ,1,1.0

It has therefore been recommended by the <strong>IUCN/SSC</strong> Insectivore Tree Shrew and Elephant Shrew Specialist Group that its precise distribution and status needs to be determined (2).

466,466,Lutra sumatrana,hairynosed otter ,Animalia,Chordata,Mammalia,Carnivora,Mustelidae,Lutra ,c. 7 kg (3),The most significant threat to the survival of the hairy-nosed otter is the illegal wildlife trade (5). A single otter pelt may fetch up to $200 an attractive reward to many hunters who often live in economically poor areas and the hairy-nosed otter may also be hunted for its meat with hunting still particularly rampant in Tonle Sap Lake and the Mekong Delta (5) (10). As a result of this hunting otter populations across Southeast Asia have undergone substantial declines (1) (14).,The hairy-nosed otter is protected by law in all of its range states and is also listed on Appendix II of the Convention on the International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) which should ensure that international trade is monitored (1) (4). Its habitat is also protected in some areas by the RAMSAR Convention and the Convention on Biological Diversity and it is found in a number of protected areas (1) (10). In reality however this species has received little protection mainly because of a lack of law enforcement at the local level and hunting and habitat loss has continued to threaten this Endangered species (3) (10). In addition to improved law enforcement this species would also benefit from further studies into its ecology and further surveys in areas which could potentially support populations such as the Irrawaddy Delta as information on its distribution is limited while there is no such information on its population (3) (6).    ,loss;hunting;disease;pollution; ,cites;protected; ,4,2.0

These problems are likely to worsen as the human population in the region expands (1). Drying out of its habitat is also a serious threat and is expected to increase in the future as a result of global climate change (1).,The conservation of the Hajar Wadi damsel will require ongoing management of good quality running waters (1) as well as measures to combat water pollution and the protection of suitable habitats (4).

468,468,Oreomystis mana,hawaii creeper ,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Drepanididae,Oreomystis ,Length: 11 cm (2),Habitat loss and degradation are present on Hawaii Island but since the Hawaii creeper is known to reproduce despite the disturbance this is not thought to be the major threat to this species. Hawaii has been subjected to a high numbers of species introductions which have had wide-ranging ecological effects. Feral pigs degrade native forests enabling the spread of alien plant species and disease-carrying mosquitoes. The mosquitoes carry pox and malaria which caused epidemics amongst birds in 1992 reducing populations significantly including the Hawaii creeper. Compounding these declines introduced rodents predate heavily on Hawaii creeper eggs reducing breeding success (2).,Honeycreeper habitat has been protected by the creation of the Hakalau Forest National Wildlife Refuge and the Hawaiian creeper is also found in the Hawaii Volcanoes National park where feral goats are actively excluded. The feral pig population has been tackled by Hawaiian conservation authorities and private landowners and cattle have been removed from some reserves. Planting of koa trees began in the early 1990s and research into the possibility of aerial release of rodenticides is being undertaken. Captive breeding is not taking place but is possible if thought to be necessary at a later stage (2). ,loss;disease; ,captive breeding;protected; ,2,2.0

Fortunately with protection and prohibition of hunting the population recovered to around 2000 at the beginning of this century (2) (5) (6). However today a much more subtle dynamic presents the greatest threat to the species survival. Non-native mallards were first introduced to Hawaii for ornamental ponds and farming in the 1800s and in the 1950s and 1960s hundreds were imported to stock hunting areas. Since then cross-breeding between the two closely related species has had a dramatic influence on the number of pure Hawaiian ducks particularly on Oahu and Maui. Furthermore it is now suspected that even the core populations on Kauai and Niihau contain hybrids (2) (5). In addition to <strong>hybridisation</strong> several other more conspicuous threats continue to have an impact on this species including predation by introduced mammals habitat loss wetland modification by alien plants and human disturbance (2).,The establishment of several State and Federal wildlife sanctuaries in conjunction with legal protection under endangered species laws and a program of re-introductions of captive bred birds was instrumental in the recovery of the Hawaiian duck population during the latter half of the 20th century (2) (4) (6). In the late 1980s a ban was placed on the importation of mallards except for research and exhibition and was followed in 2002 by the implementation of restrictive import regulations on all birds shipped to the islands to protect the public from West Nile Virus (2) (5). Even so the mallard continues to reproduce on the islands and is still sold commercially (5). The priority therefore is to control populations of mallards and <strong>hybrids</strong> to prevent irreversible genetic swamping of the Hawaiian duck populations (2). This is to be achieved via a three-pronged approach involving public outreach humane removal of feral mallards and hybrids and stronger regulatory controls on non-native potentially harmful ducks (4).

472,472,Partulina physa,hawaiian tree snail ,Animalia,Mollusca,Gastropoda,Stylommatophora,Achatinellidae,Partulina ,,As a result of human disturbances the Hawaiian Islands have seen devastating extinction rates and today over half of the described tree snails are thought to be extinct (7). Having suffered from habitat loss the Hawaiian tree snail is now restricted to just a single location with a population of less than 1000 individuals (5). This species first came under threat when the first settlers on the Hawaiian Islands began logging the lowland forests replacing natural habitats with agricultural lands and cattle ranches. These destructive activities were compounded by the introduction of non-native predators such as rats and the predatory snail <em>Euglandina rosea</em> and alien plant species which overgrow native plant seedlings limiting natural forest regeneration (2). As a result the Hawaiian tree snail listed as a Species of Concern by the United States Fisheries and Wildlife Service is under severe threat of extinction (8). The survival of this species is also hindered by its slow reproduction rate and the degradation of its habitat by feral pigs and goats (5) (6).  ,Like many other Hawaiian snail species the restricted geographic range and small population size of the Hawaiian tree snail makes it vulnerable to habitat degradation and consequently its survival may be dependant upon conservation measures (6). Fortunately for this species efforts are underway to protect its fragile habitat. In 2003 the Ponoholo Ranch which encompasses the Hawaiian tree snailâ??s habitat entered the Kohala Watershed Partnership which resulted in fencing being built along three sides of the ranch to exclude wild cattle while plans were made to cull wild pigs and remove invasive weeds. The Nature Conservancy has also agreed a 15-year management plan with the ranch with the development of a management plan for the Hawaiian tree snail a key priority (4). This vulnerable species is also benefiting from a captive breeding facility coordinated by the University of Hawaii on Lanai (5). With the successful implementation of these measures and further efforts to remove predators and limit habitat loss there is significant hope that the future of the Endangered Hawaiian tree snail will be secured (1). ,loss; ,captive breeding; ,1,1.0

If this species ever bred on Pitcairn Island its disappearance there is also likely to have been caused by introduced rats and cats (2) and it has not been confirmed to breed on Ducie Island since 1922 (3) probably for the same reasons. However other than for rats and a few introduced plants the ecology of Henderson Island is still remarkably intact with little human impact because of the islandâ??s remote location and rough terrain. Although Pitcairn Islanders travel to the island to cut wood this has little impact at current levels and a potentially damaging attempt by a millionaire to build a house airstrip and cattle ranch on the island in the 1980s was denied permission.

WWF has also begun community education and ecotourism programmes that aim to highlight the plight of this vulnerable population (5) (10). Furthermore Global Wildlife Conservation is developing plans to protect the newly discovered population in Botum-Sakor National Park southwest Cambodia although the total population size is unknown (6). The hog deer is also found in a number of protected areas including some of the most secure reserves in the world such as the Corbett Tiger Reserve in India. It has also indirectly benefited from the conservation of the Indian rhinoceros (<em>Rhinoceros unicornis</em>) with which it co-exists in wet grasslands. However many reserves are not big enough to allow seasonal movements and the level of legal enforcement received varies (1).  ,loss;hunting; ,protected;wwf; ,2,2.0

Vast areas of thorn-forest have been converted to rice and pineapple plantations and cattle pastures while urbanisation and agriculture continue to encroach upon the Honduran emeraldâ??s habitat  (5) (6). In the RÃ­o AguÃ¡n valley only 84 square kilometres of suitable Honduran emerald habitat remains while in the Agalta valley there is less than one square kilometre. Furthermore much of the remaining habitat is privately owned for cattle grazing and receives no form of protection. Consequently the population of the Honduran emerald is now critically small and it is considered the rarest bird in Central America and one of the most endangered birds in the world (4) (5) (8) (9). ,In Honduras a small poor country with a rapidly growing economy conservation is a major challenge (6). However the American Bird Conservancy is working to ensure the rare Honduran emerald is afforded increased protection through the acquisition of 30 square kilometres of suitable habitat (4) (5).

In the 1980s it is estimated that at least 10000 birds were taken from the wild (2). Throughout the macawâ??s range habitat is being lost or altered due to the introduction of cattle ranching and mechanised agriculture and the development of hydroelectric schemes (2).,The hyacinth macaw is protected by law in Brazil and international trade is prohibited by its listing on Appendix I of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) (2). There are a number of long-term studies and conservation initiatives in place; the Hyacinth Macaw Project in the Brazilian State of Mato Grosso do Sul has carried out important research by ringing individual birds and has created a number of artificial nests to compensate for the small percentage of sites available in the region (5). The effective enforcement of protection laws is required if this beautiful parrot is going to be saved from the fate of the other Brazilian parrots Lear's (<i>Anodorhynchus leari</i>) and Spix's macaw (<i>Cyanopsitta spixii</i>) which now teeter on the brink of extinction. ,loss;pet; ,cites;protection law;protected; ,2,3.0

Subsistence hunting was prevalent throughout the mid to late 1940s and the species continued to be hunted for the pet trade into the 1980s (8). Thankfully strict law enforcement a comprehensive education and awareness campaign and national pride have all but eliminated threats from poaching since the early 1990â??s (2) (7). Despite an increase in numbers the population remains low with estimates of between 150 and 250 adults remaining (4) (8) and the species is therefore still classified as Endangered by the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species (1). Habitat loss still poses a serious threat however and as lowland forests are increasingly cleared the imperial Amazon may face competition for nest sites with the related species <i>Amazonia arausiaca</i> (2).,The imperial Amazon has benefited from Dominicaâ??s long history of forest conservation and more recently from intensive governmental and non-governmental efforts to protect its habitat and make local citizens aware of its needs (8). Indeed it is as a result of a dedicated conservation programme targeted at the imperial Amazon spearheaded by the partnership between Dominicaâ??s Forestry Wildlife and Parks Division and the Rare Species Conservatory Foundation (RSCF) (8) that numbers of this species have slowly increased. To date this partnership has significantly aided this endangered parrot through integrating extensive protected-area and law enforcement legislation with staff training education and public awareness and research on both captive and wild populations (8) (6). A major result of this programme of conservation has been the creation of the Morne Diablotin National Park in the known nesting area for the species (5) first initiated in 1997 (8). An <i>in situ</i> captive programme has long been in place to research and rehabilitate the birds and a pair of imperial Amazons that has resided at the Parrot Conservation and Research Centre (Forestry Wildlife and Parks Headquarters in Roseau) since 2000 laid their first clutch of infertile eggs in April 2006 revealing important information about their reproductive biology (7). A very successful education programme in Dominica has substantially reduced trade and raised local awareness of the plight of Dominicaâ??s national symbol (2). International trade in this parrot is also tightly restricted by its listing under Appendices I of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) and the bird is protected by law on Dominica (2). The imperial Amazonâ??s comeback from a small remnant population on the slopes of Morne Diablotin following Hurricane David to near pre-hurricane levels is a testament to the effectiveness of Dominicaâ??s long-term conservation efforts (8). ,loss;hunting;poaching;pet; ,cites;protected; ,4,2.0

Disturbance can be in the form of researchers vandalism and the commercialization of caves allowing tourists to visit caves.  Modifications to mines and caves such as the construction of gates to restrict human access alter airflow temperature and humidity to which the Indiana bat is very sensitive; or gates may not allow sufficient flight space for the bats and thus block them from a critical <strong>hibernation</strong> site (2) (3).

They live by the coast where forests have become so fragmented that they are almost too small to sustain viable populations (6). The main threat is slash-and-burn agriculture a practice that continues even in protected areas (7). Forests are also cut down for fuel and timber as human populations increase (5). Hunting of the indri is a taboo in many areas on the island so this species does not suffer as much as other lemurs from trapping although sometimes it is killed for food (5) (7). Despite this the indri is a seriously endangered species and will almost certainly face extinction in the next 100 years if conservation efforts do not succeed (4).,The indri has never been bred successfully in captivity (7). Protection of their natural habitat is therefore imperative to ensure that they are not lost forever (6) (7). Unfortunately there is no easy answer to Madagascarâ??s conservation problems. Despite the indri being endangered Madagascarâ??s increasing human population needs space and resources and inevitably this erodes natural habitats (4). This problem is made worse because Madagascar is an island; this therefore limits the area that men and wildlife can expand into (6). Conservation plans have designated some areas of the island to be protected from deforestation but there is evidence that forest clearing continues inside the parks (5) (7). It would be sad indeed to see the indri populations once so prevalent dwindle away to nothing (6). ,hunting; ,protected; ,1,1.0

Habitat losses due to agriculture and development have been further causes of the decline in the Japanese crane (1). Wetlands are fragile ecosystems and both the wintering and breeding grounds are under increasing risk of degradation and loss due to conversion to agriculture and industrial development (8).,A number of international agreements have been made to protect crane species and their habitats and it is illegal to hunt Japanese cranes in all countries in which they occur (6). Protected areas have been established to safeguard the species; furthermore conservation and educational programmes have been developed with the involvement of local communities and a number of reintroduction attempts have been made (6).

The native forests of Java have been cleared for logging agriculture and development and the species has declined to fewer than 1000 individuals over the last 25 years (4). This gibbon appears to be on the very brink of extinction with only a handful of isolated viable populations remaining (6).,In light of the status of this species in the wild a Javan gibbon rescue and rehabilitation workshop was conducted in 1997 hosted by Conservation International and the University of Indonesia (2). It was agreed that a rescue and rehabilitation centre was needed and education programmes were proposed (5). Currently the only viable protected population is found within the Gunung Halimun National Park; if this attractive primate is to survive it is vital that protection both within the park and in other areas is increased (6). ,pet; ,protected; ,1,1.0

However this does little to control the threat of hunting within its range countries and whilst in some areas of its distribution hunting of wild animals is now prohibited (2) such a ban is impractical and cannot be enforced (9).  Unlike Sierra Leone and CÃ´te d'Ivoire Liberia still holds some large areas of forest with the largest stands being in protected areas and forest reserves (9).

Forests have been cleared for timber and to make way for agriculture and these birds have also traditionally been hunted for their meat. Kagus are island birds that have evolved in isolation and in the absence of terrestrial predators; when Europeans first arrived on New Caledonia they bought with them rats cats and dogs and these flightless birds represented easy prey (4). Today dogs may represent the most important threat to the survival of this species; in 1993 dogs killed 17 out of 21 radio-collared birds within the reserve of Pic Nigua alone (2).,Kagus are protected within the Riviere Bleue and dogs are controlled in this area (2). They are also found within the Reserve Speciale de Faune et de Flore de la Novdela where there is no dog control in place (2). In 1992 Birdlife International initiated a Recovery Programme for this species. A captive breeding programme run by the Southern Province and the Societe Caledonienne d'Ornithologie has been in place since 1978 (4) and juveniles have been released into the Riviere Bleue Park with some success (4).

Today a large secure cultivated population exists although it appears to contain very limited genetic diversity (7).,Most of the 200 remaining wild specimens occur within the boundaries of the Te Urewera National Park and the extensive cultivated populations do provide potential for reintroductions. A Recovery Plan has also been devised for this popular wild shrub outlining management strategies to maintain existing populations and increase total numbers of wild plants (7). , , ,0,0.0
537,537,Cuora mouhotii,keeled box turtle ,Animalia,Chordata,Reptilia,Testudines,Bataguridae,Cuora ,Length: up to 18 cm (2),Despite its large distribution it is thought that numbers of the keeled box turtle have declined drastically in some areas primarily because of over-collection. This turtle is collected for local consumption and for the national and international food and pet trade and is exploited on such a large-scale it is highly unlikely to be sustainable. For example between 1994 and 1999 6560 keeled box turtles were legally exported from Vietnam. This major threat is compounded by habitat loss and degradation due to deforestation and shifting cultivation (7).,Due to the unsustainable trade in this species the keeled box turtle was listed in 2003 on Appendix II of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) and thus trade should now be strictly controlled and monitored (3). Unfortunately Lao PDR is not a party to CITES but has increased efforts to control wildlife trade in recent years and as a result fewer turtles are seen in markets (7). ,loss;pet; ,cites; ,2,1.0

Just one quarter of the forest present 1000 years ago is still standing. European settlers brought with them ship rats brush-tail possums stoats and wild cats (1) (2) (4) which prey heavily on young and female kokakos at the nest leaving an excess of males who are not able to breed. These males sometimes pair up and nest with each other in the absence of female partners (9). Whilst in 1999 the North Island kokako population stood at 1160 birds only 396 of these were female thus limiting the number of reproducing pairs (10).,Intensive recovery planning and management since the mid 1980s has substantially recovered North Island kokako populations.  In 2007 there were 18 increasing populations totalling 850 pairs.  Such intensive management is vital as nearly all unmanaged populations are now extinct.  <strong>Translocations</strong> have established populations on four offshore islands and restored kokako to three sites in their original range (Wairarapa Hawkes Bay and East Cape) and further <strong>translocations</strong> are planned as part of widespread active restoration of mainland New Zealand forest ecosystems.

Habitat loss is principally the result of cattle farming but additional threats include alien invasive trees (particularly black wattle <i>Acacia mearnsii</i>) shading out the habitat pollution of the Kabusi River from domestic washing and siltation of the stream from cattle trampling the banks (1). Predation by introduced rainbow trout may also pose a threat (1).,A massive national rehabilitation scheme (Working with Water Programme) began in 1995 with the aim of eradicating invasive alien plants in South Africa. The programme has been a fantastic success story with other dragonflies and damselflies (e.g. harlequin sprite <i>Pseudagrion newtoni</i>) that were presumed to be extinct being rediscovered along river stretches where invasive alien trees were removed and the natural vegetation re-established (3). Thus continued work by the Working with Water Programme in the removal of alien plants could also help the Kubusi stream damsel recover in a similar way (4). A further important conservation measure advocated is the translocation of this species to a protected area where it could find safe refuge from the damaging impacts of pollution and cattle farming (1). ,loss;invasive;pollution; ,protected; ,3,1.0

Deforestation is followed by burning and reseeding but these young trees will not make suitable nest sites for another 150 years (5).,Already endangered this species cannot fully recover for 50 â?? 100 years as the old trees that are crucial to its lifestyle are currently too young. Populations in sub-optimum older-aged and mixed-aged forest are less dense than populations in optimal habitat but older forests are thought to be less at risk from wildfires (3). Therefore a management plan is in place that involves protecting both optimum and sub-optimum habitat with a nature reserve system as well as an alternative logging system that preserves high quality habitat (3).

The major threat to this species comes from the illegal wildlife trade. Collectors will pay high prices for such rare and beautiful birds and a breeding pair is thought to be worth as much as Â£50000 on the black market (4). The population of Lear's macaws is also highly influenced by the availability of their principal food source the licuri palm numbers of which have recently been vastly reduced due to livestock-grazing (5). A major fire could now wipe the whole palm population out (5) leaving this parrot fatally vulnerable.,Although protected by the Brazilian government and listed on Appendix I of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) effectively banning international trade in the species the Lear's macaw remains critically at danger from illegal trade (5). Recent infiltration of poaching rings and guarding of roosting sites may be finally slowing the decline in this species and there are plans to grow and fence 50000 licuri palm seedlings (5). A recent population survey has reported an encouraging increase in Lear's macaw numbers in the wild; in the municipalities of Canudos and Jeremoabo the population now stands at around 455 individuals (6). The steady increase in the population has led to the IUCN downgrading the Learâ??s macaw from Critically Endangered to Endangered in 2009 although continued conservation measures and repeated monitoring of the population remain high priorities to ensure the continued protection of this species (8). , ,cites;protected; ,0,2.0

In time other familiar threats became increasingly more significant including habitat loss through agricultural land conversion and over-grazing of livestock and the rapid encroachment of non-native vegetation (2) (6). In the 1980s the world population of lesser florican declined by 60 percent to just over 1600 birds but fortunately rebounded by the mid 1990s to a moderately less alarming 2200. These recent fluctuations have been found to closely match breeding season rainfall patterns and reveal the vulnerability of the species to extinction in the event of a severe drought. Worryingly it is anticipated that the pressure on remaining grassland habitat is set to continue in the future and as result the rate of decline in the lesser florican population will increase (2).,Despite the prohibition of hunting of lesser floricans throughout India and inclusion on Appendix II of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) and under Schedule 1 of the Wildlife (Protection) Act 1972 the speciesâ?? long-term survival remains uncertain because of the continued threat of rapid habitat loss coupled with high vulnerability to drought (2) (3) (6). In an effort to preserve breeding habitat two lesser florican sanctuaries Sailana and Sardarpur in Madhya Pradesh were established in 1983 (2) (7) (8). However the value of these sanctuaries is limited by the movement of monsoonal conditions which determine which areas lesser floricans choose to breed. If weather conditions are unfavourable in any given year only a small number of floricans may actually breed within the protective bounds of the sanctuaries (8). In recent years a proposal known as â??Project Bustardsâ?? has been put to the Indian government to ensure the survival of Indiaâ??s four species of bustard all of which are endangered (2) (8). This broadly includes: strictly protecting bustard habitat involving local communities in conservation establishing regional cooperation amongst different states and increasing scientific research into bustard ecology. An ambitious proposal specific to the lesser florican is to develop a network of fodder-producing grasslands throughout its range to afford local communities fodder security whilst also providing optimal breeding habitat for the lesser florican during the monsoon (8).

In Victoria about half of the range of the long-footed potoroo occurs in State Forest which is used for multiple purposes including intensive logging. In such landscapes logging prescriptions have been modified to lessen the impact on potoroos including higher degrees of habitat retention. In New South Wales nearly all known habitat for the species occurs in National Park (6). Wildfires and periodic fuel-reduction burning have a largely unknown effect on the species and the fungi on which the potoroo depends for food although in the short term loss of ground cover due to fire may be detrimental to survival (3). The long-footed potoroo occurs in small highly isolated populations so genetic problems resulting from inbreeding are a possibility. Moreover small populations are at great risk of extinction caused by chance events such as fire drought or disease (3).,Information on this elusive rare species is sparse and so further studies into habitat selection breeding dispersal diet and the threats affecting this species are needed in order to effectively conserve it (5).

Recent control measures mean that feral animals are not such a threat today although the introduction of the Australian masked-owl (<i>Tyto novaehollandiae castaneothorax</i>) in an effort to control rat numbers in the 1920s is thought to have been responsible for a major decline in one population in 1989 (5). As it is restricted to a single island the woodhen remains highly vulnerable to natural catastrophes or the accidental introduction of further non-native predators or disease (5).,In the mid-1970s the population of Lord Howe woodhen teetered on the brink of extinction as the population reached a new low of less than 30 individuals (4). Since that time conservation efforts such as the removal of wild pigs and the release of captive-bred birds have helped this species to slowly recover. The population is now estimated at 130 birds (2002) and the local community is very involved with conservation efforts which can minimise the threat of predation and disturbance by pet dogs (5). The trends in population numbers continue to be monitored but at this time the future looks encouraging for the Lord Howe woodhen. ,disease; , ,1,0.0

Estimates of this speciesâ?? population on Madagascar in 2006 indicated that there were less than 2000 mature individuals a number that is simply too small to support the current levels of exploitation. Unfortunately the Madagascar sacred ibis displays no fear of humans while nesting or roosting and is therefore an easily obtainable source of food for hunters. While legislation on hunting does exist in Madagascar it has proved ineffective in reducing hunting pressure on this species with surveys indicating that populations of the Madagascar sacred ibis are significantly declining (2).,The Aldabra population of the Madagascar sacred ibis estimated in 2001 to be around 300 to 750 individuals currently receives significant protection (2).

For centuries Madagascarâ??s forests have experienced successive waves of degradation at the hands of human colonists each with different destructive patterns of land use (7). In more recent years illegal and commercial logging charcoal production and burning to clear land for agriculture or cattle pasture have all had a devastating impact often changing open forest into dense shrubby undergrowth unsuitable as rat habitat or destroying the vegetation completely (3). The rats continue to suffer from human disturbance in the remaining forests which are used by the villagers to gather firewood collect honey dig up edible roots and hunt tenrecs and lemurs (3) (7). Predation by introduced predators such as dogs may also be playing a significant role in this speciesâ?? decline (3).,This large rodent is in urgent need of conservation and its future remains highly uncertain.

For centuries Madagascarâ??s forests have experienced successive waves of degradation at the hands of human colonists each with different destructive patterns of land use (7). In more recent years illegal and commercial logging charcoal production and burning to clear land for agriculture or cattle pasture have all had a devastating impact often changing open forest into dense shrubby undergrowth unsuitable as rat habitat or destroying the vegetation completely (3). The rats continue to suffer from human disturbance in the remaining forests which are used by the villagers to gather firewood collect honey dig up edible roots and hunt tenrecs and lemurs (3) (7).

The main cause of the precipitous decline has been excessive hunting both for meat and for its impressive horns (1) (7). Owing to the occurrence of armed conflict and the ready availability of weapons through much of its range many populations have been hunted to extinction. In addition to being highly valued as a trophy species by sportsmen the horns are also used for traditional medicine in the East Asian market (1) (2) (7). Aside from hunting the markhor is also severely threatened by habitat loss and competition for food with domestic livestock (1).,Since the mid-1990s the markhor has been listed on Appendix I of CITES which prohibits all trade in this species without a permit. In addition it is legally protected through much of its range and occurs within several protected areas although enforcement is likely to be a problem in some regions. One of the most successful conservation initiatives for the markhor has been a trophy hunting program developed in Pakistan. Local communities are encouraged to conserve the markhor through economic incentives whereby a large percentage of the money generated by a small quota of legal trophy hunts goes to the community. Owing to the success of this program proposals have been made for the implementation of similar trophy hunting conservation schemes in other parts of the markhor's range (1). ,loss;hunting;pet; ,cites;protected; ,3,2.0

Only an estimated five percent of the original vegetation of Mauritius still survives (9) and over half the plants the Mauritian flying fox now feeds on are introduced species (3). The Mauritian flying fox is also hunted for food and sport despite being legally protected (1) (3) (7). <i>Pteropus</i> species reproduce relatively slowly reducing the rate at which populations can recover from any losses (6) and the limited range of the Mauritian flying fox makes it particularly vulnerable to catastrophic events. In particular habitat loss as well as opening up the forest to hunters compounds the threat from cyclones which can sweep bats from roosts and devastate vegetation leaving little food for survivors. These effects can be particularly severe where habitat is limited or of poor quality and where bat populations are already under pressure (6) (7) (8).,The Mauritian flying fox has been officially protected in Mauritius since 1993 and is reported to occur in a number of protected areas including the Black River Gorges National Park (1) (8). The species is also protected under wildlife regulations in RÃ©union (7) and international trade in Mauritian flying foxes should be controlled under its listing on Appendix II of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) (4).

611,611,Foudia rubra,mauritius fody ,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Ploceidae,Foudia ,Length: 14 cm (2),Although threatened by the clearance of upland forest the Mauritius fody has also been suddenly lost from areas of intact habitat (2). It is thought that these regions have been affected by particularly high levels of egg predation by both the black rat (<i>Rattus rattus</i>) and the crab-eating macaque (<i>Macaca fascicularis</i>) (6).,At present it would be impossible to eliminate all rats and macaques from the whole of Mauritius and therefore conservation efforts have focussed on establishing populations on offshore predator-free islands (3). The release of captive-bred individuals onto the predatorâ??free island of Ile aux Aigrettes in 2003 has proved successful with the population which is provided with supplementary food increasing to 151 individuals by July 2008 (3). Other conservation measures in place to help protect the Mauritius fody include restoring native forests and establishing plantations of non-invasive exotic trees such as Japanese red cedar (<i>Cryptomeria japonica</i>) which mammalian predators appear to avoid (7). , , ,0,0.0

In 1986 only three females were known in the wild and the population as a whole numbered between 8 and 12 birds (4). Much of the native habitat of the island has been destroyed and remaining pockets are vulnerable to storm damage (5). The Mauritius parakeet relies completely on native fauna for both food and nest sites and has been devastated by this habitat decline (4). In addition the introduction of predators such as the crab-eating macaque (<i>Macaca fascicularis</i>) and the black rat (<i>Rattus rattus</i>) has further affected population numbers (5).,The population of Mauritius parakeets today is steadily increasing; in January 2000 the wild population stood at 106 to 126 birds and it is continuing to rise (2) with an estimated 343 wild birds at the end of 2007 (1). This has resulted in the World Conservation Union (IUCN) downlisting the Mauritius parakeet from Critically Endangered to Endangered in 2007 (1). This remarkable achievement has come about by the concerted conservation efforts of a broad-based initiative run in collaboration with the Mauritius Wildlife Foundation (6) Durrell Wildlife Conservation Trust (4) the World Parrot Trust (7) and the Wildlife Preservation Trust of Canada (2). Areas of remaining habitat have been protected and restored by removing introduced plants and animals; Black River National Park has been established to protect the majority of the wild population and is the first national park to be created in Mauritius (4). The breeding success of wild birds has been increased through programmes that supplement their diet and provide a greater number of nesting sites. In addition captive-reared birds are now being released into the wild to bolster numbers (5). This is a wonderful example of how concerted conservation effort can slow the loss of our worldâ??s biodiversity. , ,protected; ,0,1.0

The introduction of livestock to the area may have significant effects through transmitting diseases and attracting increased numbers of predators (2).,The mountain tapir occurs in a number of protected reserves in Colombia and Ecuador and is protected throughout most of the current range (2). A small number of individuals currently live in captivity at a handful of zoos (2). The Tapir Preservation Fund was set up in 1996; the aims of this organisation include the promotion of the conservation and study of tapirs. (9). It has been highlighted that local people must be involved in and benefit economically from programmes to conserve this species if they are to be successful in preventing poaching and habitat loss (6). ,fragmentation;hunting;disease; ,protected; ,3,1.0

The mountain viper has only been observed in five locations and is therefore vulnerable to over-collection. As with other species of viper the mountain viper is also subject to persecution by humans and may be intentionally killed (1).,The mountain viper is not known to occur in any protected areas but is afforded some protection by its listing on Appendix II of the Bern Convention (1) (6). Further research into the ecology and distribution of the mountain viper is needed in order to understand how to best conserve it and any future trade in this species needs to be carefully regulated (1). ,pet; ,protected; ,1,1.0

Feral cats and rats caused a rapid decline on Stewart Island (4) (5) and predation remains the greatest threat on the North Island (4). Habitat loss and human disturbance during breeding have also had a dramatic impact on populations and continue to pose serious threats (3). In particular housing industrial and tourism developments on the North Island combined with encroachment of dune-stabilising weeds have reduced habitat (4). Growing recreational use of the coastline is also set to increasingly impact on breeding roosting and feeding habitats (5). Indeed four-wheel drive vehicles picnickers and dogs can trample and disturb nests or draw defensive adults away from incubating their eggs (2). Additionally storms and very high tides can destroy nests (4) (6) and very few young survive to fledging age (2).,In 1993 the New Zealand Governmentâ??s Department of Conservation published a national recovery plan for the New Zealand dotterel and management initiatives were implemented (3). On the North Island trapping of potential predators gull control and the implementation of signs and wardens to reduce human disturbance have all helped improve breeding success (4). Control of cats and rodents in four important breeding sites on Stewart Island has also helped increase survival in southern New Zealand dotterel populations which thankfully appear to be growing (4) (5). Captive breeding trials with the more abundant northern New Zealand dotterel have been undertaken partially as an experiment to see if individuals breed well in case such a programme should be needed in the future to bolster the low numbers of wild southern New Zealand dotterels. Chicks have been raised successfully in these trials highlighting captive breeding as a viable means of preserving the survival of the species should such methods ever be needed (4). ,loss; ,captive breeding; ,1,1.0

Although this decline is thought to be associated with the impacts of Hurricane Iniki which hit the island in 1992 numerous other factors could also be implicated. Artificial lighting on the breeding islands such as street and resort lights is affecting large numbers of Newellâ??s shearwaters. Lights disorientate fledglings as they depart the island for life at sea causing them to crash into powerlines communication towers or other structures or fall to the ground exhausted.

In addition human expansion has meant that there has been an increase in cattle farming resulting in competition for the Nile lechweâ??s resources (6). As a result of these threats the Nile lechwe population is estimated to have declined by more than 50 percent over recent years (1). In the Sudd wetlands and Zeraf Reserve the situation for wildlife is likely to worsen as a result of oil exploration and exploitation in the region (1).,In Sudan the Nile lechwe occurs in three protected areas: Zeraf Fannyikang and Shambe and in Ethiopia the species occurs in Gambella National Park (1). However the benefits of these nominally protected areas are limited as the Nile lechwe shares these areas with huge herds of cattle (1). There are currently thought to be over 400 Nile lechwe held in captivity in zoos across the world (7) which can act as insurance should the worst happen to the wild population and allows an opportunity to learn more about this threatened antelope. ,hunting;pet; ,protected; ,2,1.0

Research since the early 1990s has revealed that kiwi numbers in unmanaged areas of the North Island have been declining by about four percent a year (5). These birds evolved on an island that lacked terrestrial mammalian predators and have been devastated by the introduction of species such as dogs stoats and cats (5); a single dog is known to have killed roughly 500 birds in one six-week period (2). Around 95 percent of chicks never reach sexual maturity primarily as a result of predation but also as the results of accidents such as falls from cliffs drowning and encounters with traps or poison set for possums (3) (5). The loss of much of New Zealand's habitat has exacerbated these threats by isolating surviving populations and predators in fragmented pockets of remaining habitat (5).,The North Island brown kiwi is the subject of a concerted and wide-ranging conservation programme managed by the New Zealand Department of Conservation and Bank of New Zealand Save the Kiwi (3) (4). A number of different strategies are being employed including the protection of wild nests and chicks by trapping predators the artificial incubation of eggs and chicks in predator-free environments until they are big enough and old enough to cope with stoats and cats and breeding of captive birds for release into the wild (3) (4). In the species' stronghold of Northland the Whangarei Kiwi Sanctuary has been established whilst on the Coromandel Penninsula Moehau Kiwi Sanctuary protects the individuals located there (5). Where there is active management of populations and predator control North Island brown kiwi numbers have shown dramatic increases (5). It is hoped that the many conservation measures in place will help to preserve New Zealand's national bird for generations to come. ,loss; , ,1,0.0

661,661,Eubalaena japonica,north pacific right whale ,Animalia,Chordata,Mammalia,Cetartiodactyla,Balaenidae,Eubalaena ,40 â?? 80 tons (2),Historically the North Pacific right whale was abundant throughout the North Pacific; however today only a relict population exists and the eastern sub-population is close to extinction. Intensive commercial whaling began in 1835 when European and American whaling industries significantly reduced populations to critically low numbers. International protection in 1935 by the International Whaling Commission (IWC) allowed the North Pacific right whale some respite from the intensive hunting pressure and the species began to slowly recover. However illegal whaling by the Soviet Union primarily in the early 1960s killed 372 individuals in the eastern North Pacific and an unknown number in the western population. This together with a catch of 23 whales for scientific purposes removed a substantial proportion of the population and the speciesâ?? ability to recover to pre-whaling numbers was severely compromised (5) (9).   ,Due to an extremely small population size estimated at only a few hundred in the western North Pacific and only tens of animals in the distinct eastern population the North Pacific right whale urgently requires research to identify and mitigate potential threats (1) (5). The North Pacific right whaleâ??s breeding and calving grounds need to be located and protected while further surveys are required to provide insight into the speciesâ?? habitat use and migration timing. The North Pacific right whale continues to receive full international protection but it is unclear if populations are recovering (1). ,hunting;fishing; ,protected; ,2,1.0

666,666,Bettongia tropica,northern bettong ,Animalia,Chordata,Mammalia,Diprotodontia,Potoroidae,Bettongia ,1 â?? 1.5 kg (2),Numbers of this rare species are thought to be declining (1). This fall in numbers has been attributed to several different threats in particular the alteration of the northern bettongâ??s preferred habitat as a result of a change in fire regimes in the last half century. Less frequent fires have allowed rainforest to encroach into the speciesâ?? eucalypt forest habitat and along with invasive <strong>feral</strong> pigs this has affected the supply of its primary food source truffles. Over-grazing has also substantially diminished vegetation which the bettong requires for both shelter and food such as cockatoo grass. Furthermore predation by domestic dogs is of concern particularly in areas where humans live close to bettong habitat (1) (4).,Some of the northern bettongâ??s range lies within protected areas including the Lamb Range State Forest Wet Tropics World Heritage Area and the Davies Creek National Park (1) which should hopefully offer some protection from the many threats it faces. In addition a recovery plan for the northern bettong has been established which includes plans for the maintenance of habitat a restriction on forest clearing activities the monitoring and management of fire and grazing regimes and the monitoring and control of <strong>feral</strong> pigs and predators (11). It is hoped that the recovery plan will improve the conservation status of the northern bettong not only by maintaining the existing wild populations but also by creating new ones. ,invasive; ,protected; ,1,1.0

Factors thought to be contributing include the detrimental effects of introduced plants such as blackberry (<i>Rubus fruticosus</i>) and monkey musk (<i>Mimulus moschatus</i>) which smother the breeding sites of the frog as well as the trampling effects of feral pigs and introduced horses (1). Habitat loss erosion and human disturbance are also thought to have contributed (3). A pathogen called Chytrid fungus has been detected in museum specimens and is now the major suspect for the cause of the decline (1) (4).,Much of the habitat occupied by northern corroboree frogs is within reserves providing protection for the frogs and their habitat.

Sadly wherever curassows occur they tend to be considered prime game species due to their large size and succulent flesh (4). This species has also at least formerly been illegally hunted for use of its bony casque to make traditional jewellery (2) (6). Essential forest habitat has been destroyed in both Venezuela and Colombia for conversion into cattle ranches at lower altitudes and for narcotics cultivation higher up (2). Furthermore opening up of forest habitat to human development only serves to increase the birdâ??s vulnerability to the pressures of hunting and the limited range and low reproductive rate of this species only compound such threats (4).,Almost all remaining forests in northern Venezuela are now legally protected and records of this rare bird exist from 18 national parks but this has failed to safeguard it from the threat of poachers which continue to illegally hunt it within these areas (2) (6). The situation is worse in Colombia with the species being recorded within only one â??protected areaâ?? El Cocuy National Park Arauca which is also ineffectively protected (2). This rare curassow is legally protected in Venezuela and an education programme has been established to raise awareness of the plight of the bird and its habitat (2). Captive breeding and reintroduction of the bird have also been proposed for Venezuela as a means of restoring natural populations where they have declined (2) (7). However until legislation against hunting is strictly enforced and national parks are adequately protected reintroduced individuals may have a poor chance of survival.

672,672,Eudyptes moseleyi,northern rockhopper penguin ,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Sphenisciformes,Spheniscidae,Eudyptes ,3 kg (2),A recent study of the northern rockhopper penguin population (published in 2009) has shown that well over one million birds have been lost from the breeding colonies on the islands of Tristan da Cunha and Gough. While this equates to declines of over 90 percent on both islands on Gough this loss has occurred in just 45 years whereas on the main island of Tristan it has taken almost three times longer. The reasons for the swift decline on Gough are currently unknown but the penguin may be suffering increased levels of predation as well as competition for food from the rapidly rising population of Subantarctic Fur Seals <i>Arctocephalus tropicalis</i> (5). Other factors may include increasing disturbance and pollution introduced predators reduced food supplies due to overfishing and climate change (4).,While the northern rockhopper penguin population is being regularly monitored in order to safeguard against further declines it is imperative that the causes of the population crash be determined (4) (5). This should be targeted at all possible factors including studies of interactions with commercial fisheries the impact of the introduced predatory house mouse on chick survival on Gough Island (4) and the effects of fur seal predation and competition (5). Without the implementation of appropriate conservation measures this charismatic species will continue to nose dive towards extinction (5). ,loss;fishing;overfishing;pet;pollution; , ,5,0.0

In addition it has been proposed that surveys and research of the species should be undertaken along with enforcing the protection of the Alto Mayo Protected Forest and ensuring that high-altitude forest habitat suitable for the antpitta is included within its boundaries (2) (3). ,loss; ,protected; ,1,1.0
680,680,Gallirallus okinawae,okinawa rail ,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Gruiformes,Rallidae,Gallirallus ,435 g (2),The Okinawa rail only has one very small population with a tiny range on a single island rendering it extremely vulnerable. Furthermore both its range and population are undergoing continuing declines due to introduced predators and loss of forest to logging dam construction and associated road-building and agriculture (3). Predation by mongooses originally introduced to kill the poisonous habu snake is thought to be having a significant impact on this bird along with possible predation by feral dogs and cats (3) (4) (6).,The Okinawa rail is legally protected in Japan. Yonaha-dake and parts of Mount Ibu and Mount Nishime are designated as protected areas and in 1996 Yambaru was designated as a national park. Since 1970 conservation organisations have been campaigning for the protection of Okinawaâ??s forests and have bought some sites on Mount Yonaha to establish private wildlife reserves (3). The Ministry of the Environment of Japan has recently drawn up a protection plan for this rare bird which includes an artificial breeding programme and culling of the birdâ??s predators (6). Only time will tell how successful these plans will prove to be in saving the species from extinction. ,loss; ,protected; ,1,1.0

In the arid valleys of the RÃ­o Jubones drainage areas where water is available have been widely cultivated and large numbers of cattle and goats have stripped the area of vegetation (2) (3). Local use of fires to clear vegetation also potentially threatens suitable habitat particularly if these fires get out of control (2). Another major threat is brood parasitism from the shiny cowbird which has expanded its range considerably in recent decades and is now the most widespread brood parasite of South America and abundant in the RÃ­o Jubones drainage (4). Brood parasitism has significantly impacted the breeding success of the pale-headed brush-finch with a shocking 61 percent of pairs breeding in Yunguilla Reserve parasitized in 2002 (5).,After the rediscovery of this rare bird in 1998 the small 27 hectares patch of suitable habitat in which it was found was purchased by Fundacion Jocotoco to form the Yunguilla Reserve which has since been progressively expanded to cover most of the known population (3). This Reserve has been securely fenced off to prevent grazing pressure with a local landowner hired as a part time guardian. In 2002 a habitat management scheme was implemented to halt vegetation growth and convert unsuitable to suitable habitat by selectively thinning dense thickets (2). In order to assess the success of the habitat management scheme implemented in 2002 a habitat occupancy monitoring scheme was set up with Fundacion Jocotoco in 2004 (2) (5). In 2003 a hunter was employed to remove shiny cowbirds from the reserve during the pale-headed brush-finchâ??s breeding season with a resultant 69 cowbirds shot (5). Cowbird removal strongly increased reproductive success that year with 16 chicks fledging in Yunguilla Reserve compared to just five the previous year (2). Further cowbird removal has been conducted and in 2005 the parasitism rate was down to two percent (3). Fundacion Jocotoco has also made repeated visits to local agencies land owners and schools in order to raise local awareness of the plight of this species (5).

The use of synthetic dyes only became widespread in the late 19th Century by which time the natural stands of Brazil's national tree had been all but destroyed (1). The wood is a hard and durable timber and has been in demand for construction over the centuries (3). Today the main threat facing this species is its exportation for the manufacture of high-quality violin bows (2). This tree is the main source of professional bows worldwide and it is estimated that a single violin bow which may cost up to $ 5000 requires 1 kg of wood (5). Brazil's Atlantic forest is an extremely threatened habitat and has now been reduced to less than 5% of its original cover (4).,The country of Brazil was named after the 'brasileiros' who originally collected the dyewood of this tree and the pau brasil has an important place in the history and culture of the country. This species is included in the official list of threatened Brazilian plants by the Brazilian Institute of Natural Resources (IBAMA) (1) (6) and there are various laws restricting the export and cutting of the pau brasil although these are often poorly enforced (5). Two protected areas were set up in Bahia and Pernambuco in order to preserve populations of pau brasil in these regions (5). Fauna and Flora International (FFI) have launched a SoundWood programme as part of their Global Trees Campaign in order to raise awareness of the issues surrounding the demand for hardwoods for musical instruments (4). They are working closely with a local Brazilian NGO known as Amainan Brasil (7) which is running environmental education programmes in schools in the Atlantic Forest region and is investigating the distribution of this tree in Rio State (4).

The use of synthetic dyes only became widespread in the late 19th Century by which time the natural stands of Brazil's national tree had been all but destroyed (1). The wood is a hard and durable timber and has been in demand for construction over the centuries (3). Today the main threat facing this species is its exportation for the manufacture of high-quality violin bows (2). This tree is the main source of professional bows worldwide and it is estimated that a single violin bow which may cost up to $ 5000 requires 1 kg of wood (5). Brazil's Atlantic forest is an extremely threatened habitat and has now been reduced to less than 5% of its original cover (4).,The country of Brazil was named after the 'brasileiros' who originally collected the dyewood of this tree and the pau brasil has an important place in the history and culture of the country. This species is included in the official list of threatened Brazilian plants by the Brazilian Institute of Natural Resources (IBAMA) (1) (6) and there are various laws restricting the export and cutting of the pau brasil although these are often poorly enforced (5). Two protected areas were set up in Bahia and Pernambuco in order to preserve populations of pau brasil in these regions (5). Fauna and Flora International (FFI) have launched a SoundWood programme as part of their Global Trees Campaign in order to raise awareness of the issues surrounding the demand for hardwoods for musical instruments (4). They are working closely with a local Brazilian NGO known as Amainan Brasil (7) which is running environmental education programmes in schools in the Atlantic Forest region and is investigating the distribution of this tree in Rio State (4).

704,704,Ateles chamek,peruvian spider monkey ,Animalia,Chordata,Mammalia,Primates,Atelidae,Ateles ,ca. 7 kg (2),The Peruvian spider monkey is under serious threat from hunting for food as well as from habitat loss as forests are cleared for agriculture cattle ranching and mining (1). Selective logging may also remove key fruiting trees such as figs and open up the forest to further hunting (1) (14) while the building of the Transoceanic highway between Brazil and Peru brings the threat of increased hunting and deforestation throughout the southern part of the speciesâ?? range (1). Its dependence on mature undisturbed forest makes the Peruvian spider monkey particularly vulnerable to habitat loss and degradation while its slow reproductive rate means that populations take a long time to recover from any losses (1) (2) (5) (8) (15).,The Peruvian spider monkey occurs in many protected areas throughout its range (1) and international trade in the species should be regulated under its listing on Appendix II of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) (3). However tighter controls on hunting together with stronger measures to preserve its habitat are likely to be needed if this charismatic primate is to be properly protected. ,loss;hunting; ,cites;protected; ,2,2.0

Habitat has been destroyed by clearing and illegal logging leaving less than just 1 % of original old-growth lowland forest remaining on Negros Island where the largest population of this species is found (3). Lowland rainforest on Cebu Island is virtually gone altogether and it is not known if this species still survives there as it has not been seen for over 10 years. Thus the Philippine tube-nosed bat now clings to a precarious existence edging slowly closer to extinction as illegal logging and clearing continue to reduce vital habitat ever further (4).,Both Mount Canlaon and a part of the mountainous southern fragment where this bat is thought to occur on Negros Island are designated by the national government as protected areas. Nevertheless deforestation continues to pose a serious threat including in the beautiful Twin Lakes Region that falls within the southern â??protected areaâ?? (6). If the remaining forest fragments were adequately protected this rare and intriguing species may have a chance of survival (2) but if current rates of habitat loss continue the future for this bat looks pretty bleak. , ,protected; ,0,1.0

The additional pressure of hunting for both food and for the pet trade is adding to the problem (8). It is thought that up to ten animals will have died during capture or transit for every baby gibbon sold as a pet (8).,The pileated gibbon is protected from international trade by its listing on Appendix I of the Convention on International trade in endangered Species (CITES) (2). The World Association of Zoos and Aquariums (WAZA) established an International Studbook in 1990 for the pileated gibbon and conservation breeding programmes were set up to ensure there is a viable reserve population (9). The Cardomom Project was set up with Fauna &amp; Flora International (FFI) to preserve the Cardomom Mountains region in south west Cambodia to protect both the habitat from destruction and the wildlife from hunters. It is hoped that species such as the pileated gibbon will benefit from the work carried out by this project (7). ,hunting;pet; ,cites;protected; ,2,2.0
711,711,Nesoenas mayeri,pink pigeon ,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Columbiformes,Columbidae,Columba ,0.35 kg (3),Severe deforestation on the island of Mauritius has caused catastrophic declines in a number of species the pink pigeon included (2). Predation by introduced species such as the macaque (<i>Macaca fasicularis</i>) mongoose (<i>Herpestes auropunctatus</i>) rats and feral cats have further decimated the population (6). Cyclones also batter the island destroying nest sites (2).,The pink pigeon has been rescued from the very brink of extinction by an intensive management programme in partnership between the Durrell Wildlife Conservation Trust (8) Mauritian Wildlife Foundation and the Wildlife Preservation Trust Canada (7). A captive breeding programme began in the early 1980s (6) and Gerald Durrell released the first individuals into the wild in 1984 (9). As of 2002 there are around 350 birds in the wild (9) and the project is fast approaching its target of 500 individuals (6). To supplement the captive breeding and release programme conservation efforts such as the establishment of Conservation Management Areas habitat restoration control of predators and supplementary feeding has enabled this species to increase in abundance (2). Although intensive management of the species is still required the rescue of the pink pigeon is a fantastic success story and a great example of what concerted conservation efforts can achieve. , ,captive breeding; ,0,1.0

As a result an area covering just half a hectare harbours the remaining <i>Pisonia sechellarum</i> (1) a population which was estimated to contain just 190 trees in 1990 (2).  This small population suffers from suspected low <strong>genetic diversity</strong> and a poor rate of seed <strong>germination</strong> (1) factors which my hinder the populationâ??s recovery and threaten its survival.,The small area in which <i>Pisonia sechellarum</i> occurs lies within forest protected by the Nature Protection Trust of Seychelles (NPTS) (1).  The NPTS established the Silhouette Conservation Project in 1997 and has since been protecting the islandâ??s environments and endeavouring to restore them to a near-natural state (4).

Fortunately Fonualei is uninhabited and little-visited so the population there is relatively safe from the threats of hunting and human disturbance (5). In 2003 an incredible 300 to 500 birds were estimated to exist on the island a significant increase from the 35 eggs and chicks that were introduced in 1993. Following this remarkable discovery which effectively doubled the total known population of Polynesian megapode the species was downlisted from Critically Endangered to Endangered on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species (5) (3).,The Polynesian megapode is legally protected although in practice there is no real enforcement and egg-collecting urgently needs to be brought under control. From 1991 to 1993 60 eggs were introduced on Late Island buried at volcanically heated sites and 35 eggs and chicks were transferred to Fonualei both islands being uninhabited rarely visited and with appropriate egg-laying conditions. While surveys suggest the reintroduction on Late failed the now established population on Fonualei is a fantastic conservation success story and provides new hope for the future of this rare bird. It has been advocated that Fonualei should be given Reserve status and if achieved this volcanic island may prove to be the safe refuge that ensures the Polynesian megapodes long-term survival (5). However there is always the threat of eruption which could potentially destroy the Fonualei population completely and thus this speciesâ?? restricted range leaves it in an extremely vulnerable position. ,hunting;pet; ,protected; ,2,1.0
724,724,Cercopithecus preussi,preusss guenon ,Animalia,Chordata,Mammalia,Primates,Cercopithecidae,Cercopithecus ,Average body length: 47.7 cm (2),Over the past 27 years populations of Preussâ??s guenon have decreased by an incredible 50 percent (1) due to a combination of habitat loss and hunting. As a result of farming fire and the collection of wood for fuel little of Cameroonâ??s <strong>montane forest</strong> remains. Preussâ??s guenon is particularly vulnerable to hunting due to its fairly large size and its semi-terrestrial habits; spending time on land increases its risk of being killed. Hunting of this species is a particular problem on the island of Bioko (1).,A significant hindrance to the conservation of this species is that no <strong>montane forest</strong> in the Cameroon highlands is currently protected; this situation needs to urgently change as it is the most critical remaining habitat for Preussâ??s guenon. However there are several national parks elsewhere in this monkeysâ?? range including Banyang Hbo Forest in Cameroon Cross River National Park in Nigeria and Pico Basil National Park on Bioko Island (1). This species is also listed in the African Convention as Class B which means it is protected but may be hunted captured collected or killed if special authorisation is given (9). ,loss;hunting; ,protected; ,2,1.0

Vast areas of the native rainforest have been cleared for timber and for the construction of oil-palm plantations which now constitute one of Malaysia's top exports (4). Proboscis monkeys do not adapt to degraded habitat and recent technical advances have meant that even mangrove swamps may now be logged (4). Hunting is also a threat to the survival of this species; their propensity to gather in large groups on the river's edge makes these monkeys easy targets (4).,The proboscis monkey is protected by law (4) and is listed on Appendix I of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) banning international trade (3). This species is found in at least a dozen protected areas (2). Recently a vital area of wetland in Sabah has been designated as a sanctuary for a wide range of endangered species such as Asian elephants (<i>Elephas maximus</i>) and orang-utans (<i>Pongo pygmaeus</i>) as well as proboscis monkeys; this area is the Kinabatangan Wildlife Sanctuary (4).

Deforestation as a result of agricultural industrial and residential development has led to habitat loss and fragmentation and the consequent isolation of subpopulations which impedes out-breeding and genetic diversity. From 1956 to 1993 Sri Lanka lost more than 50 percent of its forests to human activities followed by a similar rate of decline between 1994 and 2003. This species has also suffered from hunting and illegal trade of its meat and skin with the skin used to make drums in some areas. The purple-faced langur is hunted mainly for subsistence living and trade at local village level. According to continuing trends populations of this species are predicted to decline by more than 50 percent within the next 11 to 22 years (1).,The commercial exploitation of purple-faced langurs is regulated by their listing on Appendix II of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) (3). All four <strong>subspecies</strong> are also protected under the Flora and Fauna Protection Ordinance 1993 and exist in a number of protected areas (1). However the issue of habitat loss still places these <strong>subspecies</strong> classified as Endangered and Critically Endangered at serious risk of extinction (1). Indeed the Critically Endangered western purple-faced langur (<i>T. v. nestor</i>) was officially recognised in 2004 as one of the worldâ??s 25 most endangered primates. This <strong>subspecies</strong> requires good canopy cover but possibly fewer than three forests currently exist within Sri Lanka that can support viable populations and none of these are within protected areas. Furthermore the human-modified areas that support much of the langur population such as gardens and rubber plantations are under private ownership and therefore unstable changing rapidly due to human population expansion and development. Censuses are therefore urgently needed to identify forest areas suitable for conservation. Further studies are also essential to better understand the decline of sub-populations in both space and time in the extremely disturbed habitats where these langurs survive today (6). ,loss;fragmentation;hunting; ,cites;protected; ,3,2.0

Fetching thousands of dollars per butterfly this rare species has suffered severely from over harvesting (4). Recognising a dramatic decline in 1966 the Papua New Guinea government gave Queen Alexandraâ??s birdwing legal protection from collectors. Consequently trade in this butterfly has been somewhat reduced but illegal collection continues to threaten this species. Today however the greatest threat to Queen Alexandraâ??s birdwing is the loss of its lowland rainforest habitat. Historically forests were cleared for subsistence farming and logging and large tracts of forest were destroyed by the volcanic eruption of Mount Lamington in 1951. Presently the main cause behind forest loss is the expansion of the palm oil industry compounded by the development of rubber and cocoa plantations (7).  ,Threatened by illegal trade and habitat loss the survival of Queen Alexandraâ??s birdwing is dependant upon the successful implementation of conservation measures. To abate trade pressure Queen Alexandraâ??s birdwing is listed on Appendix I of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) and as an Annex A species in the EU Council Regulation on trade of wild species both of which prohibit international trade (2) (3). Furthermore the Papua New Guinea government has provided financial aid to local communities to develop butterfly nurseries.  These licensed farms aim to sustainably trade wild butterflies whilst providing local communities with an additional income and improving the long-term survival prospects of many rare butterfly species (8).

The attractive plumage of the red-and-blue lory has made it a popular cage bird for over a century and consequently wild birds have been intensively trapped to fulfil the demand for international trade. Trapping began as early as the 19<sup>th</sup>century with most birds being traded within Indonesia and the Philippines. Trapping intensified in the 1990s with an estimated 1000 to 2000 birds leaving Karakelang each year (6). Around 3500 birds were traded between 1992 and 1993 which attracted more trappers and resulted in the development of modern more efficient trapping methods. In 1995 the red-and-blue lory was at last listed under Appendix I of CITES which prohibited international trade excluding exceptional circumstances such as scientific research (3). However trapping continued in the latter 1990s with an estimated 80 percent of the illegal trade going to the Philippines (7).  ,Karakelang is believed to contain the only remaining viable population of the red-and-blue lory and consequently efforts are underway to reduce trade on the island (7) (10). The Action Sampiri project is working to improve awareness amongst local communities about the global importance of the island to the species and to improve future land use. Investigations by the wildlife trade monitoring network TRAFFIC and the inclusion of the species on the Indonesian list of protected species also highlights the speciesâ?? plight and the urgent need for the application of conservation measures (7).

Habitat destruction has been rife and is primarily the result of conversion to plantations and pastureland and logging operations (2) (5). Surviving populations are small and fragmented and now suffer from reduced foraging sites increased competition for nesting areas and the effects of genetic isolation (2). Yet deforestation continues compounded by the ever-present threat of capture for the domestic pet trade driving this rare parrot into a steep decline (2) (6). Sadly the species is not even safe in reserves with most of the 174 nestlings poached for the national and international cage-bird trade in the 1998 to 1999 breeding season reportedly coming from â??protected areasâ??. Souvenirs containing feathers have also been seen for sale outside Monte Pascoal National Park (5).,The red-browed Amazon is protected under Brazilian law and occurs in 14 reserves though most of these provide very little habitat protection on the ground and none are effective against poaching (5). Captive breeding though difficult has been successful in America and Europe and a global management plan for captive red-browed Amazons is now underway (2) (6). Reintroductions into the wild from captive stock may become an important conservation strategy in the future but it is unlikely to successfully bolster numbers until sufficient habitat is secured that can sustain expanded wild flocks (2).

750,750,Ara rubrogenys,redfronted macaw ,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Psittaciformes,Psittacidae,Ara ,Length: 55 - 60 cm (2),The reasons for the drastic decline of this species include widespread habitat loss and degradation largely as a result of conversion to agriculture but also caused by logging and collection of firewood. This species is illegally trapped for the pet trade but the scale of this problem is unclear. Furthermore as the natural food sources of this bird are lost it has to rely more on crops and it becomes increasingly exposed to persecution as a result (2).,The red-fronted macaw is listed under Appendix I and II of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) and so international trade in this species is tightly controlled (3). Within Bolivia the capture transport and export of this species are illegal. This macaw occurs in just one protected area but just eight birds are known to breed within this park. Birdlife Bolivia initiated a conservation programme for this species in 2002 which incorporates surveying and monitoring of the species identifying priority areas of habitat for the species and establishing a community awareness programme in the area. Other proposed measures include the complete elimination of trade in this bird and fencing-off areas of suitable habitat to reduce grazing by livestock allowing the natural vegetation to make a come-back (2). ,loss;pet; ,cites;protected; ,2,2.0

Although laws exist to protect this species from hunting throughout its range such protective legislation is rarely enforced (1). This rare primate is particularly vulnerable to this exploitation as when disturbed it remains motionless in the canopy instead of fleeing making it an easy hunting target (1) (5). It has also suffered from extensive habitat loss particularly in the Central Highlands of Vietnam where large tracts of forest were damaged during wartimes (1) (8). More recently a rapidly expanding human population in this region has resulted in agricultural expansion with forest areas converted to farmlands and increased logging for coffee rubber and cashew plantations (1) (5).,The red-shanked douc is afforded the highest level of protection in Vietnam under the Wildlife Protection Law and should be protected from international trade by its listing on Appendix I of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) (3) (8). It also receives a degree of protection in a number of national parks and reserves including several in the Nam Theum basin in Lao PDR which is thought to support the largest remaining population of the species although hunting is still prevalent in many protected areas (7). There is also an ongoing captive-breeding programme for the red-shanked douc at the Endangered Primate Rescue Center at Cuc Phuong National Park in Vietnam (9). In addition the Douc Langur Foundation has been undertaking comprehensive surveys of this species in an effort to understand the distribution of populations which is vital for any successful conservation programme. The Foundationâ??s studies are also helping to uncover greater knowledge of this still poorly understood primate such as group size and composition and social interactions (10). WWFâ??s Indochina Programme is also carrying out vital research into the effectiveness of national parks within Vietnam and trains reserve rangers in primate survey techniques (11). The effective enforcement of existing laws and national parks will be the key to ensuring the future of this attractive and appealing primate (7). ,loss;hunting;pet; ,cites;protection law;protected;wwf; ,3,4.0

Then in 1968 one of the most severe cyclones to ever have hit Rodrigues struck and with a search in 1969 failing to find any warblers it was thought to have wiped out one of the islandâ??s <strong>endemic</strong> birds (5).  Thankfully the species had not gone extinct and numbers have since recovered slightly primarily due to an increase in forest cover through habitat protection and <strong>afforestation</strong> (5).,The slow recovery of the Rodrigues warbler since 1969 has been the result of efforts to protect the islandâ??s watersheds which allowed the surrounding forests to mature and recover and a switch to the use of bottled gas for cooking lessening the demand for firewood (5) (6).  Nature has also played a role in this speciesâ?? recovery with a recent absence of catastrophic cyclones allowing populations to increase (6).  While much of the reforestation has involved exotic trees native species are being replanted in some areas including two Conservation Management Areas where grazing animals and woodcutters are kept out and exotic plants are removed (6).  Exotic plant species are a major cause of the lack of native habitat on the island but these introduced trees and shrubs also provide a vital haven for the Rodrigues warbler in the absence of native forest.  For the native forest to regenerate it is considered necessary to remove all exotic tree species but this may have a short-term detrimental impact on warbler populations.  Hopefully the long-term benefit to the island and to the Rodrigues warbler will outweigh this short-term loss (5).

The island has the largest known nickel deposits in the world (9) and land clearance for mining is the greatest threat both to <em>Araucaria rulei</em> and to the many other <strong>endemic</strong> conifers which are often restricted to the mineral-rich areas from which the nickel ore is obtained. In addition to causing widespread deforestation mining activities have also resulted in large waste heaps and increased erosion (1) (2) (6) (7) (9). Further threats to the native vegetation include human-generated wildfires which are often started deliberately to clear brush as well as agriculture livestock grazing and the spread of invasive exotic species (6) (7) (8) (9) (10).,New Caledonia is considered a biodiversity â??hotspotâ?? having for its size a remarkably unique and diverse flora and fauna (8) (9) (10). Of the 3000 or so plant species over 74 percent are <strong>endemic</strong> (8) (9) as are all but one of 44 conifer species (6) (9). Two thirds of the worldâ??s <em>Araucaria</em> species are also unique to this island (2) (5) (9). However the protected area network on New Caledonia is not currently representative of this diversity and most of the islandâ??s native plants including <em>Araucaria rulei</em> do not occur in any protected areas. In addition very few existing reserves are covered by any mining regulations (8) (9).

774,774,Amaurornis olivieri,sakalava rail ,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Gruiformes,Rallidae,Amaurornis ,Length: 19 cm (2),Based on surveys conducted between 2003 and 2004 it is tentatively estimated that the Sakalava rail population numbers between 100 and 200 birds. For a species with so few individuals the rapid degradation and destruction of Madagascarâ??s bio-diverse wetlands poses a very serious threat to its long-term survival. In Madagascar human encroachment and conversion of habitat for rice cultivation is widely responsible for a massive reduction in the area of wetlands. For the Sakalava rail the introduction of non-native fish and a decline in reed habitat partially attributable to harvesting by humans is likely to be having an additional negative impact (2). Fortunately the Sakalava rail is considered too small for hunting and in some areas it is even traditionally taboo to collect its eggs (2) (3).,In January 2007 the Madagascar government passed legislation granting the protection of the Mahavavy-Kinkony Wetlands a 300000 hectare wildlife area and home to all of western Madagascarâ??s wetland birds including the Sakalava rail (5). Further to the statutory protection of such a large area of Sakalava rail habitat it is hoped that in the near future a national conservation plan specific to the species will be established. For the development of such a plan it is vital to gain a greater understanding of its ecology and distribution. Given that there are many areas with suitable habitat that have not yet been surveyed there is some optimism that the Sakalava rail population may be larger than the current estimates suggest (2). ,hunting; , ,1,0.0

Of those captured for the falconry trade the vast majority are thought to be young females creating a major age and sex bias in the wild population that dramatically reduces its breeding potential (2) (6). Females are preferred by falconers due to their larger size and young birds because they are easier to train than adults (2). In Europe the saker falcon is mainly threatened by the loss and degradation of <strong>steppe</strong> and dry grassland habitat due to agricultural expansion and declines in sheep pastoralism which has in turn reduced the availability of key prey species and suitable hunting ground (6). Across the birdâ??s range declines are also the result of predation (by eagle owls steppe eagles and golden eagles) human persecution electrocution shooting poaching and accidental poisoning through pesticides which contaminate the falconâ??s prey (2) (6) (7). In some parts of its range rodent plagues result in the extensive use of poisons to control them causing the indiscriminate deaths of many raptors that feed on them (5) (7).,The saker falcon is protected across much of its range particularly in Eastern Europe where controls of illegal trade were implemented in various countries in the 1990s (6). There have been concerted conservation efforts in Europe and intensive patrolling and management has even produced a steadily rising population in Hungary (5) (6). The species is listed on Appendix II of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) and in 2002 CITES imposed a trade ban on the United Arab Emirates (3). However more needs to be done to monitor illegal trade which evidently continues and to enforce regulations against it. Certain countries including the United Arab Emirates have reduced the demand for wild-caught birds by captive breeding â??farmedâ?? saker falcons to trade to falconers instead (6). A programme to erect artificial nest platforms in the Mongolian steppe is proving a significant conservation measure for the breeding saker falcon population (7). Constructing artificial nests prevents the falcon constructing nests on electricity pylons during which many are electrocuted (8). In addition a number of research programmes have also been established to learn more about the distribution population and ecology of this species in addition to the threats facing it which should help to inform appropriate conservation efforts and management strategies in the future (6). ,loss;hunting;poaching; ,cites;captive breeding;protected; ,3,3.0

784,784,Cyclura rileyi,san salvador iguana ,Animalia,Chordata,Reptilia,Squamata,Iguanidae,Cyclura ,up to 1.25 kg (2),<i>Cyclura rileyi</i> is amongst the most threatened of the West Indian rock iguanas with two of its three recognised subspecies being listed as critically endangered by the IUCN and the third as endangered (6). One of the most devastating impacts has been the large-scale habitat destruction by European and American colonialists who cleared forests for conversion to agriculture and introduced many non-native plants and animals (6). The San Salvador iguana now has a relatively remote distribution away from most human settlements but a large and varied range of threats nevertheless continue to make their prospects of long-term survival tenuous (4) (8).,Since a number of surrounding cays as well as the mainland of San Salvador have very similar habitat to that currently used by the species reintroductions to parts of the iguanaâ??s former range are a viable and important focus of conservation efforts (4). An introduced population of Acklinâ??s iguanas (<i>C. r. nuchalis</i>) currently thrives on an island within the Exumas Land and Sea Park (6) and a successful translocation of five adult pairs of <i>C. r. rileyi</i> from Green Cay to Cut Cay took place in February 2005 funded by a 2004 grant from the International Iguana Foundation (7). Candidate cays for further reintroductions (and source of animals) include Barn Cay (from Guana Cay) Cato Cay (from Green Cay) and High Cay (from Low Cay). Corrective actions may first be required to render each cay suitable for reintroduction (e.g. removal of feral rats) and reintroduction of iguanas on the mainland should be undertaken only if large areas are protected particularly from the feral dogs and cats that are already numerous in local areas (4). ,poaching;disease; ,protected; ,2,1.0

In the 1800s the rate of deforestation accelerated dramatically first with the production of coffee and later with cocoa. At one stage in the early 20th century SÃ£o TomÃ© was the worldâ??s largest producer of cocoa with an estimated 42 percent of the island being devoted to its production. The crash in the price of cocoa and the islandâ??s conversion to independence in 1975 significantly slowed down the rate of forest clearance but not before almost all the islandâ??s lowland <strong>primary forest</strong> had been destroyed (9).,There are no known specific conservation measures in place for the SÃ£o TomÃ© giant treefrog but this species does occur in the protected Obo National Park (1).  ,loss;pet; ,protected; ,2,1.0

Ever since the Portuguese settled on the island in 1479 large areas of forest have been lost as land was converted for agriculture such as sugar coffee and cocoa plantations (2) (3). More recent deforestation is attributable to the construction of houses and gardens(1). Today it is largely the remote and inaccessible areas of forest that remain untouched (3).,As extremely little is known about this species there is a great need for studies to establish its abundance and distribution and to better understand the threats it faces (1). There are currently no direct conservation measures in place aimed at the protection or management of the SÃ£o TomÃ© shrew (1). ,invasive;pet; ,protected; ,2,1.0

Populations suffered badly in Russia in the 1960s and 1970s when a period of intense economic development led to extensive habitat destruction and alteration. Thankfully large scale deforestation in river valleys has since been banned and the rapid decline in this speciesâ?? population was halted (5). Nevertheless a variety of other threats still affect the scaly-sided merganser in Russia including forest fires illegal hunting drowning in fishermens' nets disturbance from motor boats during the breeding season river pollution and natural predators (2) (5). In China breeding populations continue to decline rapidly in the face of deforestation illegal hunting human disturbance and the use of poisons and/or explosives for fishing and have disappeared from much of their former range (2).,The scaly-sided merganser is a Nationally Protected Species (First Class) in China a protected species (category 1) in North Korea and a protected species in South Korea (5). This bird can also be found in a number of protected areas in both its breeding and wintering range notably Sikhote-Alin' State Biosphere Reserve in Russia and Changbai Shan Nature Reserve in China (2) (5). A number of studies of this species have been conducted including research that has shown females readily use artificial nest boxes with several returning to breed in the same boxes in subsequent years. Over 130 artificial nest boxes have been erected alongside Russian rivers (8) which not only increase the availability of nest sites and therefore breeding capacity but also provide a valuable opportunity to study the breeding biology of this rare duck. ,hunting;fishing;pollution; ,protected; ,3,1.0

An intensive commercial fur trade from 1740 until about 1900 resulted in the sea otter being harvested almost to extinction and by 1900 the sea otter was so rare that commercial harvesting was forced to cease (6). Sea otters were protected by an international treaty in 1911. Since then numbers have recovered to an extent but human activities especially coastal development and marine pollution now pose a threat to the sea otter (6). In 1989 hundreds and possibly thousands of sea otters were killed as a direct result of the Exxon Valdez oil spill in Prince William Sound in Alaska (4). The possibility of another major oil spill poses a continual threat to the sea otter and could have devastating consequences. Additional threats include entanglement in fishing gear particularly gill nets and competition with commercial fisheries for food (6). In the central Aleutian Islands Alaska sea otters have declined by as much as 90 percent (4). Evidence indicates that this drastic decline is the result of increased predation by killer whales which have switched to consuming more sea otters following the collapse of Stellerâ??s sea lion and harbour seal populations in the region (4).,The sea otter is legally protected in the United States under the Marine Mammal Protection Act and in Canada sea otters are protected under the Species at Risk Act (10).

Land use changes have lead to the desiccation of its aquatic habitat on which it is dependent for reproduction and feeding. The scarcity of suitable habitats has lead to the range of the Semirechensk salamander becoming severely fragmented and populations becoming disjointed (1). Local fishing practices involving the diversion of streams have also resulted in reductions in certain populations of the Semirechensk salamander (1) (3).,The Semirechensk salamander is listed in the Red Data Books of the USSR and Kazakhstan and is listed as a protected species in the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region in China. Only part of the Semirechensk salamanderâ??s range is thought to fall within a protected area although its presence there is unconfirmed.

The Seychelles wolf snake is preyed on by the tenrec (<i>Tenrec ecaudatus</i>) an opportunistic feeder that was introduced to the islands of MahÃ© and Praslin probably as a source of food (1) (2) while another introduced species <i>Cinnamomum verum</i> is impacting the snakeâ??s habitat (1).  Introduced to the islands in 1772 and subsequently spreading so rapidly that by the end of the 19th century extensive forests of this plant existed (5) this cinnamon plant continues to invade and degrade native forests (1).   The fairly restricted distribution of this species makes it particularly susceptible to the impacts of any threats it faces (1).,The Seychelles wolf snake occurs in a number of protected areas throughout its range including Morne Seychellois and Praslin National Parks and Aride Special Reserve (1).

Since human settlement in 1964 the Kinangop Plateau has been primarily used for dairy farming which retains grassland as pasture but now landowners are showing a preference for crop-farming over livestock-farming. As a result grassland is being rapidly converted into cultivated land (5). Tussock grasslands now cover only about a quarter of the plateau and many of the patches are too small to support a population of Sharpeâ??s longclaw. Increasing human populations will lead to further loss and fragmentation of grassland habitats and it is predicted that by 2010 tussock grasslands will have diminished to cover only about one-fifth of the plataeau (4).,The highland grasses of Kenya occur almost entirely on private land with no formal protection. The conservation of grassland is critical to the conservation of Sharpeâ??s longclaw but it will only survive if the habitat is managed in a way that is in harmony with the needs of the landowners. With a preference for crop-farming over livestock farming landownerâ??s interests seem incompatible with grassland conservation. However a survey in 1996 showed that a substantial proportion of landowners were prepared to consider opportunities to enhance the areaâ??s conservation value (5). A local conservation action group â??Friends of Kinangop Plateauâ?? is campaigning for an initiative that encourages production of food crops from small gardens without having to convert large grassland areas (4).

A local conservation action group â??Friends of Kinangop Plateauâ?? is campaigning for an initiative that encourages production of food crops from small gardens without having to convert large grassland areas (4). Improving milk processing facilities to make dairy farming more appealing and providing landowners with economic incentives to maintain grassland habitat are proposed measures that will help protect the Sharpeâ??s longclaw and other species of Kenyaâ??s grasslands (3). ,loss;fragmentation; , ,2,0.0

812,812,Thinornis novaeseelandiae,shore plover ,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Charadriiformes,Charadriidae,Thinornis ,60 g (2),Predation by introduced cats and rats caused the original precipitous decline of shore plover numbers from mainland coasts and from the other Chatham Islands (3). The population on Rangatira Island was itself decimated by human collectors who took hundreds of specimens for scientific purposes at the beginning of the 20th Century (2). Today the shore plover is extremely vulnerable as the species is mainly restricted to a single island; the accidental introduction of predators or a natural disaster has the potential to completely wipe out this species (2). However the discovery in 1999 of a second small population and progress with the establishment of new populations in the Chathams and mainland New Zealand does provide slightly more stability for the species (5).,Conservation efforts to save the shore plover represent one of the first cases worldwide to establish new populations of a strong-flying shorebird (3). Rangatira Nature Reserve was established in 1954 (6) but the key to the survival of this species will be the creation of independent populations elsewhere. Relocations to other predator-free islands in the Chatham group initially failed due to these birds' strong homing instincts; individuals returned to Rangatira Island (6). A captive population is being held at the National Wildlife Centre at Mount Bruce and this provides birds for <strong>translocations</strong> to island locations off mainland New Zealand (4). Recent transfers to Mangere Nature Reserve (Mangere Island is also within the Chatham group) have been more successful; between 2001 and 2002 28 birds were relocated (5). As of September 2002 11 birds were present on Mangere Island and one chick had fledged successfully (5). The population of shore plovers on Rangatira Island is only around 123 birds (5) but sustained conservation efforts continue to produce encouraging results for the future of this attractive bird. , , ,0,0.0

Individuals are also taken from the wild to be sold at markets as pets (2). The combination of these threats has reduced the population of silvery brown bare-face tamarins by over 50 percent in the last 18 years leaving the species in a precarious position where any further reduction could have a cataclysmic effect (2).  ,Currently there is only one reserve the Canon del Rio Alicante where the silvery brown bare-face tamarin can be found. However this area is poorly protected and the land has been exploited for the benefit of local people. Therefore a method of protecting this animal whilst allowing development in surrounding communities is needed. A campaign is currently underway for the creation of a protected area for the species in the north-east of the department of Antioquia Colombia which would also benefit the variegated spider monkey (10) (11). ,pet; ,captive breeding;protected; ,1,2.0

Habitat loss and degradation also continue to be major threats as a result of dam construction the removal of vegetation along riverbanks river and stream canalisation drainage for agriculture and water pollution (1) (3) (5). Large-scale deforestation has also indirectly affected freshwater habitats causing severe flooding and the deposition of soil on river beds (1). There has also been some concern that the southern river otter may face competition from the introduced American mink <em>Mustela vison</em> although this is now believed to be less likely than previously feared (1) (3).,International trade in the southern river otter is banned under its listing on Appendix I of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) (4) and the species is also listed on Appendix I of the Convention on Migratory Species (CMS) (6). In Argentina important populations occur in Nahuel Huapi National Park Tierra del Fuego National Park and on Staten Island (1) (3) (7). Recommended conservation measures for the southern river otter include population monitoring improved control of poaching education measures and the maintenance of vegetation cover along shorelines.

This population decline is due in part to competition with the mosquitofish (<em>Gambusia holbrooki</em>) (2); introduced by man to the region as a method of  controlling mosquito numbers this fish is one of the most invasive fish species worldwide (5). As a result the Spanish toothcarp is now restricted to bodies of water where the mosquitofish is absent (1).,The Spanish toothcarp has been the focus of a number of conservation actions.  A project in Catalonia running from 1996 until 2000 worked to conserve the toothcarp and other species and a captive breeding program resulted in 20000 Spanish toothcarps being released back into the wild (6). In Murcia conservation efforts have included the elimination of the invasive fish species habitat management and restoration and captive breeding of the Spanish toothcarp (7). However whilst introductions of captive bred individuals help boost population numbers of this species the threats to the Spanish toothcarpâ??s natural habitat need to be tackled if its future is to be secured (1). ,loss;invasive;pet; ,captive breeding; ,3,1.0

Indeed much of the forest understorey has been cleared for planting cardamom in the Knuckles Mountains where this lizard is found although the canopy has been retained for shade (4). The Agra-Bopath area of this speciesâ?? range is becoming increasingly isolated by surrounding vegetable cultivations and tea plantations with the lack of clearly demarcated boundaries leading to significant encroachment into this forest (4) (5). Isolation of populations prevents both important genetic flow between subpopulations and means of escape from forest fires (4) (7).

The drainage of wetlands deepening of marsh habitats in favour of waterfowl populations and the conversion of wetlands into agricultural and residential land has resulted in the loss fragmentation and modification of the spotted turtleâ??s habitat. This has left remaining spotted turtles living in very small isolated subpopulations which are more vulnerable to the effects of <strong>inbreeding</strong> over-collection for the pet trade and predation (7) (11). In addition road related mortality is thought to be a significant factor for nests and hatchlings as well as female adults as they travel over land to nest (4) (6). In Ontario pollution of aquatic habitats by substances such as DDT and PCBâ??s is also thought to be a problem for some spotted turtle populations (6). Predators such as raccoons dogs snapping turtles skunks foxes and other small mammals are responsible for the low recruitment of juveniles preying most heavily on eggs and hatchlings but occasionally also on adults (4) (6). Unfortunately the spotted turtleâ??s life history traits namely high egg (and probably hatchling) mortality low reproductive potential in the wild delayed sexual maturity (7 to 14 years) balanced by a long potential adult breeding life deem it highly vulnerable to population collapses when faced with these threats (2) (10). If adult survivorship is reduced through factors such as human exploitation road mortality or increased predator levels populations are inevitably unable to produce and successfully raise enough offspring to recover depleted numbers leading eventually to local extinctions (2) (11).,Spotted turtles are legally protected to some degree from exploitation in most states and provinces in which they are found but protection is not yet consistent or universal over the turtle's range (2) (5). In Canada the spotted turtle is listed as Endangered by the Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada (COSEWIC) (2004) and is listed as a Specially Protected Reptile (Schedule 9) in the Fish and Wildlife Conservation Act (1997). In the U.S. the spotted turtle is not currently listed in the US Federal Endangered Species Act; however it is listed in 22 of the states in which it occurs (2).

860,860,Clemmys guttata,spotted turtle ,Animalia,Chordata,Reptilia,Testudines,Emydidae,Clemmys ,Maximum length: 13.6 cm (2) (3),Spotted turtle numbers are declining due to unsustainable collection for the pet trade habitat destruction and fragmentation road mortality agriculture and pollution (2) (12). The drainage of wetlands deepening of marsh habitats in favour of waterfowl populations and the conversion of wetlands into agricultural and residential land has resulted in the loss fragmentation and modification of the spotted turtleâ??s habitat. This has left remaining spotted turtles living in very small isolated subpopulations which are more vulnerable to the effects of <strong>inbreeding</strong> over-collection for the pet trade and predation (7) (11).

Montane forests have been extensively cleared for conversion to timber plantations and agriculture firewood collection particularly around Nuwara Eliya Maskeliya and Bogowantaalaw and gem mining. Even some â??protected forestsâ?? are unable to escape these threats and continue to be degraded and fragmented. In particular the replacement of natural mixed forests containing fruiting trees with single-species plantations has badly affected this bird by reducing its available food supply. In addition streams within this speciesâ?? range are becoming polluted with run-off chemicals such as insecticides and pesticides from nearby vegetable farms almost certainly harming stream-dependent birds such as the Sri Lanka Whistling-thrush. It has also been speculated that mountain forest die-back may be the result of acid clouds rain and mist caused by air-pollution (3) (4).,The Sri Lanka whistling thrush is legally protected in Sri Lanka and occurs in several national parks and forest reserves most notably Peak Wilderness Sanctuary and Hakgala Strict Nature Reserve (3) (4).

Consequently the sun parakeet is now rare or absent in much of its former range with an estimated 1000 to 2500 wild birds remaining (5). Guyana removed an annual quota of 600 birds from the wild in the 1980s while around 2200 birds were exported to the United States alone between 1981 and 1985 (2) (5). The trade in parrots is notoriously popular in Brazilian markets and although the number of traded wild sun parakeets is unknown it is likely to be very high (7). Birds are easily captured using seed bait and whole flocks can be extirpated from an area very easily. The sun parakeet is also threatened by habitat conversion for agriculture and live stock overgrazing but the severity of these threats have not yet been evaluated (5).,The sun parakeet is currently listed on Appendix II of CITES meaning international trade must be regulated and requires export permits (3). However it has been proposed that the species is upgraded to Appendix I due to the severe detrimental impact of trade on wild populations (5). This would result in the prohibition of international trade in the species excluding exceptional circumstances such as scientific research (3). Further proposed conservation measures include working with the indigenous inhabitants of the Terra Indigena Raposa Serra do Sol and the Amerindian community in Karasabai village to prevent the trapping of wild birds and to protect sun parakeet habitat. Further surveys are also required to identify the full extent of the speciesâ?? range and to evaluate the impact of habitat loss and conversion (5). ,pet; ,cites; ,1,1.0

However the clearing of these trees for agriculture residential development plantation timber sawlog production and clear-felling for woodchips has reduced this parrotâ??s breeding habitat by 44% (2) (5).

In addition swift parrots suffer high mortality through collision with windows vehicles and fences. The total swift parrot population is estimated to be no more than 1000 pairs. At best it is stable but given the current mortality rates and habitat destruction it is more likely to be declining (5).,As this species is such as specialist in both its winter habitat and foraging requirements the survival of the swift parrot will depend on the protection of remaining areas of eucalypt species and the protection of all breeding and foraging sites in Tasmania (6).

Without urgent action there is a high probability of this mangabey becoming extinct over the next 50 - 100 years (11). In 1994 it was estimated that just 1000 to 1200 individuals remained (1). The population is possibly much lower today since their habitat has been severely degraded since then with an approximate 30 % loss of original vegetation (10) (12). In addition local communities continue to degrade the remaining forest for products used in the construction of homes and canoes the collection of wild honey and the topping of date palms to make palm wine (12). As the average number of mangabey groups has been found to correlate with forest area and density of trees the loss and degradation of forest is a major cause for concern. Mangabey-human conflict has also increased in recent years due to crop-raiding resulting in traps being set (1).,The Tana River National Primate Reserve was established in 1976 to preserve the endemic and endangered Tana River mangabey and Tana River red colobus (<i>Colobus rufomitratus</i>) (13) but only covers part of the mangabeyâ??s range. A 5-year project with the World Bank and Global Environment Facility (GEF) was also started in 1996. Originally designed to relocate several hundred families that presently live within the reserve financial support was ultimately withdrawn before completion of the project (12). Sadly forests continue to decline and a new conservation approach is desperately needed to protect them where past approaches have failed. Their failure was largely due to disregard of land-tenure issues within the Reserve exclusion of local people from decision-making and neglect of forests outside the reserve (10). Solutions must be found for the problem of forest clearing and the harvesting of forest products must be better managed if there is any chance of protecting the habitat of this critically endangered primate and evading its otherwise imminent extinction. ,loss; , ,1,0.0

As a consequence this iconic species was persecuted for many years through trapping and poisoning (1) (3). In the face of persecution deforestation and a severe epidemic in the early 20<sup>th</sup>century the Tasmanian devil became extremely rare until a protective law was passed in 1941 that saw its numbers gradually rise again (3). Although systematic poisoning resumed with questionable merit in the 1980s and 1990s by this stage the population had recovered sufficiently for the species to be abundant in many parts of Tasmania (2). Then in the mid 1990s disaster struck when a number of Tasmanian devils were sighted with strange facial tumours later discovered to be a fatal cancer now commonly known as Devil Facial Tumour Disease (DFTD) (3) (4) (5). ,In the absence of drastic conservation measures the Tasmanian devil is projected to be extinct in the wild within 25 years (3). Fortunately considerable effort is being made at the local national and international level to prevent the realisation of this dire forecast. In May 2009 Australiaâ??s Federal Government uplisted the Tasmanian devil to the â??Endangeredâ?? category under the Commonwealthâ??s Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 which will ensure the species receives greater protection under national environmental laws (3) (4). At the forefront of conservation efforts is the Save the Tasmanian Devil Program launched in 2003 and co-ordinated by the Tasmanian Governmentâ??s Department of Primary Industries and Water (1) (3) (4). The focus of the program is: to continue to monitor the impact of DFTD on the Tasmanian devil population; to further investigate the disease including its transmission and causes; to develop methods of managing the impact of the disease; and to maintain an insurance population recruited from disease free areas.

Much of Sri Lankaâ??s original tropical moist montane forest has been cleared during the last two centuries for cinchona coffee tea rubber and cardamom plantations for grazing livestock by logging companies illegal logging and removal of timber by peripheral villagers (5) (8). The montane forests of the Knuckles Mountains where this species is found have been particularly affected by cardamom cultivation which requires that much of the forest understorey is cleared and although the canopy is retained for shade continuing weeding of the area to remove competing vegetation prevents natural regeneration of the forest. Some areas are also still cultivated for vegetables using traditional slash and burn techniques and on occasion this can lead to out-of-control forest fires (6). With a rapidly growing population and increasing demand for agricultural land the destruction of montane forests continues at an alarming rate. Further more there is intensive use of pesticides on vegetable cultivations and tea plantations in Sri Lanka which could be having a serious polluting affect. Although the impact these chemicals are having on non-target species is not yet known studies elsewhere indicate that they could potentially be devastating with possibilities for <strong>bioaccumulation</strong>. There is also evidence in the tropical moist montane forests of the Knuckles Mountains of large-scale forest die-back thought to be the result of acid rain and these forests are considered particularly at risk from climate change especially global warming (5).,Project Knuckles 2004 and a follow-up expedition in 2005 were initiated to conduct the first in-depth study of reptiles and the primary threats facing them in the Knuckles Mountain Range (6). It was discovered that the region held some of the highest reptile diversity in the country and is therefore an important site for conservation. Tennentâ??s leaf-nosed lizard was one of three target species studied (9). As of 2000 areas above 1067 m above sea level were given protected status as conservation forest.

In particular introduced predators such as the rainbow trout (<em>Oncorhynchus mykiss</em>) and small mouth bass (<em>Microterus dolomieu</em>) have had a major impact on this species when they were introduced to the Treur River (1) (3).,In 1970 the only area in which the Treur River barb occured Bendigospruit was declared an International Biological Program (IBP) conservation site. This status restricted practices such as the introduction of new fish or bird species to the area and this has reduced disturbances to the stream and therefore to the Treur River barb (5). The land owners of the site also have their own conservation plan which includes clearing invasive plant species near the river bank (3). , , ,0,0.0
903,903,Agelaius tricolor,tricoloured blackbird ,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Icteridae,Agelaius ,Length: 18 â?? 24 cm (2),Historically the tricoloured blackbirdâ??s population underwent a serious decline primarily due to habitat loss as a result of urbanisation conversion of land for agriculture and the draining of wetlands. In addition hunting of this species for sale at markets and deliberate poisoning to safeguard crops were both extensively practiced up until their ban in 1970s and 1980s (4). Despite losing a great deal of its native habitat the tricoloured blackbird has adapted and today large numbers breed in silage and in upland regions (3). Unfortunately in these environments this species faces new threats as many colonies are being decimated by herbicide poisoning predation and in particular silage harvesting. The silage harvest takes place while the tricoloured blackbird is laying eggs and brooding chicks and may therefore destroy an entire colonyâ??s breeding efforts. With some silage colonies comprising tens of thousands of birds these losses represent a significant portion of this speciesâ?? global population (3) (4).,Efforts to conserve the tricoloured blackbird have been made by the US Fish and Wildlife Service by either purchasing whole areas of silage from private landowners or by paying them to delay the silage harvest long enough to allow the tricoloured blackbird to successfully breed (4). While this has been extremely beneficial for the survival of tricoloured blackbird colonies the US Fish and Wildlife Service do not consider it to be a long-term solution for the management of this species. Other proposed measures to conserve this species include delaying herbicide application until the tricoloured blackbird has completed its breeding cycle and the creation of areas of marshland and blackberries within key silage nesting regions offering a safe alternative breeding habitat (2). ,loss;hunting;environment; ,endangered species act; ,3,1.0

905,905,Prosobonia cancellata,tuamotu sandpiper ,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Charadriiformes,Scolopacidae,Prosobonia ,32 â?? 44 g (2),The Tuamotu sandpiper has disappeared from much of its former range and is undergoing a continuing decline due to habitat loss and the effects of introduced species. The threats to the survival of this bird are mounting as its island environment becomes increasingly colonised encroached upon and disturbed by humans who destroy habitat for settlements and coconut plantations. The introduction of predators such as cats and rats particularly the black rat (<i>Rattus rattus</i>) is another serious concern and has probably eliminated the species from all but the most infrequently visited islands. As a result this formerly widespread bird is now restricted to just a few known locations that are typically predator-free uninhabited islands (3). An additional concern has been expressed about the impacts of climate change and sea-level rises which have the potential to flood and submerge the small islands on which this endangered species lives (5).,Research expeditions in 1999 2001 and 2003 have helped collect and collate valuable information on the Tuamotu sandpiper and its distribution but further surveys are still desperately needed (3) (6). Further conservation measures advocated include identifying suitable islands for translocation either rat and cat-free or where eradication is possible and developing a recovery plan for the species (3). If measures such as these are not undertaken soon this bird may fall victim to the ever growing extinction crisis that currently threatens our planet (2). ,loss;environment; , ,2,0.0

This suggests it has been rare for a very long time. However the particular conditions the beetle requires are hardly ever found and the felling of old trees for safety reasons means that its habitats are becoming even rarer.,Efforts in the UK have concentrated on providing more sites for the violet click beetle. There are few suitable trees on the British sites at Bredon Hill and Windsor. Some trees were found to contain <strong>larvae</strong> but none of the others seemed likely to provide the right conditions. Following the great storm of 1987 one old hollow beech in Windsor Forest blew down. Ted Green the (then) warden managed to re-erect it by using another living tree as support and then began to experiment with various 'rotting' ingredients to attempt to create the conditions needed by the violet click beetle. After seven years Ted's efforts bore fruit and five <strong>larvae</strong> were found inside his prepared tree. Plans are well under way to erect and prepare more suitable trees and even artificially 'age' some. This is taking place with the help of dead wood <strong>invertebrate</strong> and <strong>fungus</strong> specialists as part of English Nature's Species Recovery Programme. , , ,0,0.0

Such rampant destruction is almost certainly having a serious impact on the species and it may already have been exterminated from some islands.  Hunting for subsistence trade and sport has also devastated populations on some islands and it is now possibly extinct on Sicogon as a result (6).  Extensive hunting and trapping of the Visayan tarictic continues unchecked in many areas (6).,The Visayan tarictic is listed on Appendix II of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) which means that trade in this species should be carefully controlled (3).  This endangered bird also occurs in the protected areas of the North Negros Forest Reserve and Mount Canlaon Natural Park although the first only receives nominal protection and the status of Mount Canlaon has not prevented the total clearance of the lower slopes (10) (11).   On Panay the declaration of the North-Western Panay Peninsula forest as a protected area affords some protection to the Visayan tarictics breeding there (12) and the Central Panay Mountains National Park has been proposed which would encompass the majority of the islandâ??s Visayan tarictic population (11).  The proper protection of all these sites is an extremely important measure required for the survival of the Visayan tarictic.  The Philippine Endemic Species Conservation Project (PESCP) operates a nest protection programme for the Visayan wrinkled hornbill (<i>Aceros waldeni</i>) in north and north-west Panay which also benefits the Visayan tarictic.  Hunting and trapping of the tarictic in those areas has virtually ceased due to the monitoring and confiscations undertaken by PESCP (12).  Mount Talinis and Mount Canlaon have also been the target of conservation awareness campaigns which has reduced local hunting pressure (6) (11). ,hunting; ,cites;protected; ,1,2.0

Habitat has been destroyed and degraded by intentional fires overgrazing by cattle and sheep over-exploitation of pine for timber encroaching agriculture and property developments and cutting of grasses for thatch and brush manufacture (1) (6). Nearly all fires are started by humans often originating from people burning zacaton to promote new growth of pasture for cattle and sheep (6).,Hunting of the volcano rabbit is now illegal under Mexican law but enforcement remains difficult. The species is found within two protected areas Izta-Popo and Zoquiapan National Parks but habitat destruction nevertheless continues to occur even within these areas (1) (6). In 1990 the World Conservation Union Species Survival Commission (IUCN/SSC) Lagomorph Specialist Group created an action plan for this rabbit focusing on the need to manage burning and overgrazing and to enforce laws prohibiting the capture sale and hunting of the animal (6). As a result the population of volcano rabbits is higher now than a decade ago (7).

Nearly all fires are started by humans often originating from people burning zacaton to promote new growth of pasture for cattle and sheep (6).,Hunting of the volcano rabbit is now illegal under Mexican law but enforcement remains difficult. The species is found within two protected areas Izta-Popo and Zoquiapan National Parks but habitat destruction nevertheless continues to occur even within these areas (1) (6). In 1990 the World Conservation Union Species Survival Commission (IUCN/SSC) Lagomorph Specialist Group created an action plan for this rabbit focusing on the need to manage burning and overgrazing and to enforce laws prohibiting the capture sale and hunting of the animal (6). As a result the population of volcano rabbits is higher now than a decade ago (7). Captive breeding colonies exist at Los Coyotes Park and the Chapultepec Zoo in Mexico City but there are currently no plans to reintroduce captive-bred individuals into the wild (6) (7). ,hunting; ,captive breeding;protected; ,1,2.0

Subsequently this ibex has suffered extensive hunting by local people for its meat hides and horns (2). The horns have been used by local people to make drinking mugs and also as trophies by sportsmen to decorate their homes (3). Additionally important habitat has been threatened by encroaching settlement livestock grazing and cultivation (6). Road construction is fragmenting habitat and facilitating traffic which increases the chance of erosion and noise disturbance (7). In 1963 it was estimated that between just 150 and 200 individuals remained (3) but with the creation of the Semien National Park around 1969 poaching appeared to be brought under control (2). The species is now reported to number over 500 and to be on the increase (6). A major conservation problem remaining however is that the natural habitat left is extremely limited (2).,In 1969 the Semien National Park was established to protect the habitat and the endangered wildlife it sustained and the walia ibex became a â??flagshipâ?? species for the area (1). The park was also placed on the World Heritage List in 1978 (7). Guards were appointed from Geech to Mietgogo to curb local poaching and illegal cultivation and burning of habitat resulting in a steady increase in numbers in the past fifteen years (3). It can be difficult to enforce the current protection laws (3) and human encroachment continues but a recent report suggests that hunting now seems to be almost non-existent (7). It appears therefore that the presence of park scouts is having some success in this respect since local attitudes do not seem to have changed to demonstrate awareness or concern for the plight of these animals (7). Propagating a greater awareness and understanding of the grave position of the magnificent walia ibex both amongst the local communities and government officials is therefore an important focus for future conservation efforts in the battle to save this Endangered species (3) (7). ,hunting;poaching; ,protection law; ,2,1.0

Softshell turtles are widely eaten and are also used in Chinese medicine kept as pets or released into temple ponds (2). Chinese have used turtle products for thousands of years but changes in the economy have resulted in a dramatic increase in the demand for luxury items such as turtles within the last 25 years (6).,The wattle-necked softshell turtle is listed on Appendix III of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) in China meaning that China has asked other countries for assistance in controlling the trade in this species (3). In addition in China there are numerous turtle farms breeding large numbers of wattle-necked softshell turtles. While this may have the benefit of lessening pressure on wild populations there are also a number of issues that need to be investigated further to ensure that turtle farms are not actually damaging wild populations. These issues include whether the breeding stock is replenished with wild individuals; and whether an increased availability of turtles through farming affects the demand for turtle products (6). A number of scientists have recommended that instead of attempting to adapt the farming industry for conservation purposes protected areas should be established to preserve the remaining wild populations (6). Should such measures not succeed the future survival of the wattle-necked softshell turtle may depend on those introduced populations in Mauritius and Hawaii (1). ,pet; ,cites;protected; ,1,2.0

Thus these areas have undergone considerable human colonisation development and exploitation with local settlements fragmenting critical curassow habitat (7). Additionally commercial and subsistence hunting is higher in these areas because of the easy access via the rivers and hunting is the primary cause of decline for this species (2) (7). In particular the replacement of traditional hunting practices with shotguns had a dramatic impact and the wattled curassow population plummeted (6). During the 1960s this unusual and distinctive looking bird was heavily hunted for subsistence by fur traders on the rÃ­o Beni in Bolivia but the prohibition of fur-hunting by CITES in 1971 thankfully reduced this threat (2).,The wattled curassow is afforded some degree of protection in the MamirauÃ¡ Sustainable Development Reserve in Brazil although it nevertheless continues to be hunted there and Pacaya-Samiria National Reserve in Peru. A temporary hunting ban has been implemented in Bolivia in order to secure the future of local hunting stocks by allowing the population to recover and this has reportedly had some success (2). It has been proposed that governments and nature reserves develop and help encourage ecotourism as an alternative means of income and subsistence for local people and as a source of sustainable development for the country (2) (6). To this end AsociaciÃ³n ArmonÃ­a the BirdLife International partner in Bolivia is channelling funds into the development of a small scale ecotourism project in San Marcos in Bolivia where the only remaining population of wattled curassows in the country is found (8) (9). AsociaciÃ³n ArmonÃ­a has worked closely in conjunction with the local community of San Marcos to ensure that vital Bolivian populations are preserved (8). The area around this species has been petitioned as an â??indigenous territoryâ?? and there is now a boat to the area for tourism with plans for a lodge and trained guides cooks etc. by 2007 (9).

This speciesâ?? native prairie habitat is being increasingly lost to agriculture as well as to developments for housing and commercial use. The inappropriate management of native prairie can also have devastating effects on the Western Prairie fringed orchid damaging the plants or altering the ecology of the habitat such that it no longer favours orchids (1) (3).

Road kills may pose a significant threat particularly during the breeding season when the toads migrate to the breeding sites (1) (2) and urban development can also increase the physical barriers to such movements (2). In addition artificial water bodies with vertical sides such as swimming pools and stormwater drains can present death traps to toads while further threats at some breeding sites include pollution and introduced species such as predatory fish invasive plants and captive ducks which can consume eggs and tadpoles. The replacement of lawns and flowerbeds with stone and paving may also be reducing available foraging habitat (2) and there is increasing concern that the introduced guttural toad <i>Amietophrynus gutturalis</i> may compete with the western leopard toad for food and resources (8). An isolated population in the east of the range appears to be most under threat despite occurring in the least urbanised habitat (9).,The western leopard toad is legally protected within South Africa (2) and also occurs in some protected areas such as the Agulhas National Park and in the northern parts of Cape of Good Hope Nature Reserve.

Hunting pressure is believed to have caused the possible extinction of Miss Waldronâ??s red colobus (8).,The western red colobus is listed on Appendix II of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) meaning that any international trade in this species should be carefully regulated (3). It is also listed as a Class B species under the African Convention on the Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources which means it should only be legally captured or killed with special authorisation (9). The western red colobus occurs in a number of protected areas throughout its range (1). ,loss;hunting; ,cites;protected; ,2,2.0

Consequently in 2012 the IUCN Red List uplisted the species from Near Threatened to Endangered (1). These population declines have been caused by a combination of factors: the loss and conversion of the vultureâ??s habitat for agriculture declines in wild <strong>ungulate</strong> populations reducing the availability of <strong>carrion</strong> hunting for use in traditional medicine capture for the illegal live trade (7) electrocution on electricity pylons drowning in farm reservoirs (8) persecution and poisoning (7).,A number of protected areas in Africa hold populations of white-backed vultures including Serengeti National Park in Tanzania a World Heritage Site (9). Yet the recent declines are worrying and further action is clearly required. Recommended measures include establishing legal protection for the species in all range countries establishing a vulture monitoring network and determining the most significant threats and seeking solutions (7). ,loss;hunting; ,protected; ,2,1.0

Unfortunately the presence of insurgents in some areas complicates park management (6). There is a substantial subpopulation of this species in Colombia between the Rios Caguan and Yari. This area is at the present time relatively isolated but developments that may enable colonists to move into the area will quickly endanger this subpopulation (6). ,hunting; ,protected; ,1,1.0

Thus the white-collared brown lemur is listed as one of the worldâ??s 25 most endangered primates (6).,Currently this lemur is found in two protected areas: Manombo Special Reserve and Andringitra National Park (6) although there is further concern here as the Andringitra population hybridizes with <i>Eulemur rufus</i> (5) (6). Recent surveys have also identified populations in unprotected forests such as Vevembe that could be added to existing parks and reserves (4).

960,960,Oxyura leucocephala,whiteheaded duck ,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Anseriformes,Anatidae,Oxyura ,Length: 43 - 48 cm (2),This endangered duck faces several threats. The world population lies between 7910 to 13110 birds (2). At present the main threat to the Spanish population is its <strong>interbreeding</strong> with non-native North American ruddy ducks <i>Oxyura jamaicensis</i> which were brought to the UK in 1930s for captive wildfowl collections (8). Some young ruddy ducks escaped from captivity in 1952 and began to breed in the wild. The hybrids produced are fertile and therefore pose an increasing threat to the white-headed duck. The expansion of the ruddy duck could also threaten populations of white-headed duck across Asia (9). Evidence strongly suggests that UK birds are responsible for the ruddy duck's spread across Europe (10).,Ruddy duck populations are currently controlled in Spain Portugal and France. In the UK where the spread of the ruddy duck is believed to have originated the Government conducted a control trial that proved it is possible to eradicate the ruddy duck (11). <strong>Re-introduction</strong> schemes have also been conducted in Spain France and Italy to boost this speciesâ?? numbers. There is hope for the recovery of the white-headed duck not least because of Spainâ??s conservation achievement. In the 1970s there were only 22 individuals prompting dedicated conservation projects in Spain. These were hugely successful and there are now around 2500 ducks in Spain (12). It is hoped that other countries can follow Spainâ??s success to protect the white-headed duck. In 1996 a European Action Plan was published to unite Europeâ??s bird conservation groups and save the white-headed duck from extinction (5). ,loss;hunting;fishing;pollution; , ,4,0.0

The SantarÃ©m-CuiabÃ¡ highway provides easy access to the Xingu-TapajÃ³s region making the forests vulnerable to clearance for soybean farms and infrastructure development. Soybean plantations currently threaten only a small portion of the white-nosed sakiâ??s range but clearance for cattle ranching is also a threat (1).,As well as being listed on Appendix I of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) (4) the white-nosed saki is protected under the Brazilian Endangered Species Act which prohibits the capture collection sale or export of this species (10). Its range also includes two reserves: the Parque Nacional da AmazÃ´nia and Floresta Nacional do TapajÃ³s which offer this species some protection (1).

As with all spider monkeys this species is also particularly susceptible to hunting (1) (4) with a slow reproductive rate making it difficult for populations to recover from losses (1). The decline of the white-whiskered spider monkey is predicted to continue into the future particularly as vast areas of forest are cleared to make way for soy bean plantations (1).,The white-whiskered spider monkey occurs in a number of national forests in Brazil including the TapajÃ³s National Forest and Xingu National Forest although more strictly protected areas will be needed for its conservation (1). Surveys are being carried out throughout the range of the white-whiskered spider monkey (1) and it has been chosen as a â??flagshipâ?? species for the preservation of Cristalino State Park where it is still relatively abundant (9) (10). Fauna and Flora International and the FundaÃ§Ã£o EcolÃ³gica Cristalino together with their community education programme Escola da AmazÃ´nia are working together to help protect the Cristalino State Park one of the most diverse areas in the region.

972,972,Aspidites ramsayi,woma python ,Animalia,Chordata,Reptilia,Squamata,Boidae,Aspidites ,Length: 1.5 m (2),Populations have been affected by the clearing of habitat for agricultural development and grazing in Australia. Habitat loss not only removes the woma pythonâ??s shelter but also depletes the abundance of small <strong>vertebrates</strong> in the area. Predation by introduced foxes has also played a part in the woma pythonâ??s decline in Australia (2) (5).,This species is listed on Schedule 4 of the Western Australian Wildlife Conservation Act which classifies it as Specially Protected Fauna (2). Under the Australian Protected Areas Programme a 132566 hectare area has been established to protect species including the woma python (6). It is important to provide incentives for landowners in this area to reduce the impact of current land use practises on this species (2). Population surveys should be conducted on the woma python both within and outside of this reserve in order to best target conservation practices (2). ,loss; ,protected; ,1,1.0

Egg predation by skunks raccoons and opossums is becoming a serious problem due to an increase in the number of these scavengers since human settlement with egg and hatchling mortality exceeding 80 percent in some areas (6) (10). In the last few decades commercial poachers have mercilessly exploited this turtle for the pet trade range-wide and remain the primary threat to the species in a number of areas (6) (8). Significant numbers are also lost from road mortality shooting of basking turtles by vandals and incidental collection by recreationists (8). Indeed two wood turtle populations in areas of Connecticut previously closed to the public declined to virtual extinction within a decade of being exposed to human recreationists (3) (8). Because these turtles have a late onset of sexual maturity and a slow reproductive rate but a long lifespan they depend upon a long adult reproductive span to sustain population levels. Removal of just a few individuals thus has a dramatic impact and can easily lead to local extinction (3).,The wood turtle is legally protected to varying degrees by all the states and provinces where it lives and is totally protected from commercial collection and trade (5) (8). Like many endangered turtle species captive breeding may be the solution to satisfying the commercial demand for the wood turtle. Unfortunately this has led to many reptile breeders scrambling to obtain specimens while they still can (11).

Many thousands have been illegally exported from Mexico and some from Belize each year and this bird is popular in domestic markets (2). Moreover it has been estimated that up to 90% of smuggled parrots die before reaching foreign markets (4). In Belize this bird is also hunted and persecuted for being a crop pest (2). Deforestation has been extensive with large areas cleared for agriculture pasture lumbar and settlements resulting in the loss of nesting and foraging habitat (2) (5).

Taken from the wild for its meat and eggs for use in tradition medicines for the pet trade and for release into Buddhist temples (5) the yellow-headed temple turtle is now considered to be Endangered (1). Accentuating the impacts of exploitation in some areas is the threat of habitat loss. The lowland riverine habitat of the turtle in Lao PDR is unfortunately shared with high densities of people while in Malaysia suitable swamp habitat is at risk of being drained for land development. Suitable habitat is Thailand is also vulnerable to degradation with pollution and entanglement in fishing nets also affecting the yellow-headed temple turtle (5).,Throughout its range the yellow-headed temple turtle occurs in numerous protected areas and there are also national laws in place offering this species some protection although illegal trade remains of concern (5). In 2003 this turtle was listed on Appendix II of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) meaning that any international trade in this species should now be carefully monitored to ensure it is compatible with its survival (5) a measure which will hopefully go some way to aid the long term survival of this turtle. ,loss;fishing;pet;pollution; ,cites;protected; ,4,2.0

Habitat loss is a serious threat to the yellow-throated apalis and is responsible for a continuing decrease in its population size (2).,All of the areas inhabited by the yellow-throated apalis are within forest reserves and are therefore legally protected.

The principle agent behind this decline was the creation of Greers Ferry Lake in 1962 which resulted in the inundation of downstream tributaries creating deep pools with increased sedimentation and lower oxygen levels in the water. As an inhabitant of shallow fast-moving streams the yellowcheek darter was displaced from much of its former range moving upstream to less suitable areas of habitat. The speciesâ?? migratory behaviour was also disrupted while the loss of downstream refugia made the species more vulnerable to droughts resulting in the loss of many populations (7). Other threats such as the channelization of streams for agriculture and human consumption have isolated some populations and a loss of <strong>genetic diversity</strong> has been observed due to <strong>inbreeding</strong> (3) (8).,Having suffered such a severe decline the yellowcheek darter is in drastic need of major conservation measures. Indeed the species has been proposed for Threatened Status under the U.S Endangered Species Act (9). An agreement has also been made between several conservation organisations and landowners to mitigate threats to the species protect bordering terrestrial habitats; and explore potential reintroduction programmes (3).

As a result this bird has disappeared from 75 percent of its former range (4). As with much of New Zealandâ??s endangered fauna habitat destruction has been a major cause of decline with many forests still being cleared or modified by selective logging. Predation also poses a serious threat with yellowheads suffering periodic population crashes when stoat (<i>Mustela erminea</i>) numbers erupt (4). These eruptions follow seasons of heavy beach seeding that occur every four to six years which allow species up the food chain to multiply with populations of insects then mice and then stoats proliferating (4) (6). Stoats prey upon eggs chicks and incubating adult females that are unable to escape from the nest hole resulting in huge losses and a dramatically biased sex ratio (4) (6). Black rats (<i>Rattus rattus</i>) brought over on ships are also excellent climbers and prey upon eggs chicks and incubating females (3) (4). It is also thought that stoat control initiatives in certain areas may have reduced predation on the increasing rat population (3) (6). Competition for insects and honeydew from introduced vespulid wasps has contributed to the birdâ??s disappearance from beech honeydew forests in the northern South Island and introduced finches are thought to also be competing for food and contributing to the speciesâ?? decline (6).,A monitoring programme established in 1983 carefully tracks 14 populations of yellowheads in 12 key sites and stoats have been trapped in key habitats during years of heavy seeding (4). Survival rates in the Eglinton Valley Fiordland National Park have been closely followed for more than ten years to monitor whether stoat control efforts are having a positive impact and initial results show that intensive trapping of predators does benefit the yellowhead (3). In addition birds have been translocated to three mammalian predator-free habitats including Codfish Island in 2003 where individuals proceeded to successfully breed the following season (4).

The human population in this remote corner of China has exploded in recent decades and forests are being cleared both for timber and to make way for agriculture (5). The populations of snub-nosed monkeys that remain are isolated in fragments of the former forest (8). Hunting of this primate was banned in China in 1975 but lack of funds and staff means that this law is hard to enforce and hunting persists (2). Monkeys are also accidentally trapped in snares set out for other wildlife (6).,The Government of China banned the hunting of snub-nosed monkeys in 1975 although this has proven difficult to enforce (2). Around half the population of the Yunnan snub-nosed monkey occurs within protected reserves such as Baima Snow Mountain Nature Reserve where wardens are trying to work closely with the local people to secure the future of this species (5). In 1998 a national logging ban on all remaining old-growth forests came into force which will help to preserve some of the monkey's precious habitat (5).

These slow-moving animals provide easy targets particularly with motorized vehicles and automatic weapons and their meat and leather are prized by local people (8). Other factors involved in the decline include <strong>desertification</strong> drought and habitat encroachment by pastoral expansion and subsistence agriculture (5) (10). It is estimated that fewer than five hundred individuals survive in the wild today with the bulk of these lying between the Termit area of Niger and the BodÃ©lÃ© region of Western Chad (9).,The addax is listed on Appendix I of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) thus prohibiting international trade (3). Provided effective protection is granted for the last remaining pockets of populations it is possible that the species can increase. With this in mind the Sahara Conservation Fund has developed a regional strategy that when implemented will protect the remaining wild populations and facilitate the recolonisation of neighbouring suitable habitats (10). A protected population exists in the Yotvata Hai-Bar (Wildlife Preserve) Nature Reserve in Israel to the north of Elat (11). The reserve was set up in 1968 with the view to bolster populations of endangered desert species (12). In Niger a vast protected area is being established in the Termit region to protect the largest remaining addax population in the wild (10).

The species is now restricted to a few forest patches in the south and east of the island where fewer than 300 may now survive (1) (4) (6).

Deforestation and forest degradation has led to the severe fragmentation of the duikerâ??s habitat but firewood collection unfortunately remains one of the few sources of income for many people living near the forests (1). An additional threat may be posed by the presence of feral dogs which are thought to have destroyed an introduced duiker population on Funzi Island (5).,Adersâ?? duiker is a protected species in both Kenya and Zanzibar (1) although the law is often poorly enforced (9). A Species Recovery Plan is in place on Zanzibar with recommendations including improved protected status for the species the development of a new larger conservation area with a strict anti-hunting policy conservation education programmes continued population monitoring and further research into the speciesâ?? behaviour and ecology (6). A conservation and recovery plan has also been proposed for Kenya (1). In 2000 five Adersâ?? duikers were <strong>translocated</strong> to the well protected privately run conservation area of Chumbe Island where a female was already present but the success of this programme needs to be monitored (1) (4) (6). The possibility of a captive breeding programme is also being investigated (1) (3) (6) (11) while the use of trophy hunting as a conservation tool has been suggested but is controversial (1) (4) (6). ,loss;fragmentation;hunting; ,captive breeding;protected; ,3,2.0

The area around Lac Alaotra is the largest area in Madagascar developed for rice cultivation and vast areas of the reed bed habitat have been burned and drained (1) to make way for paddy fields (6). In addition reeds are themselves harvested for products such as mats fish traps screens and fencing (6).

There has been almost complete destruction of low-altitude forest across East Africa mainly for conversion to agricultural land (3) and the few remaining forests of the Eastern Arc Mountains where this species is found are under considerable pressure (5). While the main viable subpopulation of Amani flatwings is relatively safe within the Amani-Sigi Forest Reserve any other subpopulations within the vicinity are either already extinct or on the verge of extinction as a result of human encroachment forest destruction and water pollution. Even the protected population leads a relatively precarious existence containing fewer than an estimated 250 mature individuals (1).,The Eastern Arc forests of Tanzania contain many endangered species found nowhere else on Earth but remain under serious threat from an encroaching human population and are in immediate need of conservation action (5). Fortunately the stream around which the one remaining viable population lives is protected within a forest reserve in the East Usambara Conservation Area and is therefore relatively safe from any immediate danger (3). Nevertheless any changes to this stream could result in the extinction of the species and it has been advocated that an extensive survey of the whole area is urgently needed to locate any further remaining populations (1). ,pollution; ,protected; ,1,1.0

One of the major causes of this decline in abundance is the fragmentation of available habitat; leading to changes in the availability of carrion increased competition and the isolation of remaining popualtions (2). ,The precarious sate of the population of American burying beetles was recognised in 1989 when the species was listed as Endangered on the U.S. Fish &amp; Wildlife Service Endangered Species List (3).

A large herd of 1200 feral cattle have destroyed the vegetation cover at lower altitudes on Amsterdam Island reducing this speciesâ?? available breeding ground. Introduced predators also pose a major threat particularly feral cats and Amsterdam Island has suffered from fires started by humans which destroy vegetation and possibly birds (2) (9). The effects of longline fisheries around the island in the 1970s and early 1980s may also be to blame for the serious decline in numbers (4) (10). Although population numbers have recently been increasing a continued decline is projected owing to the potential spread of certain diseases (Avian cholera and <i>Erysipelothrix rhusiopathidae</i>) that affect the Indian yellow-nosed albatross (<i>Thalassarche carteri</i>) population on the same island (1) (4). Indeed increased chick mortality over recent years suggests that the Amsterdam albatross population has already been affected (4).,The Amsterdam albatross is listed on Appendix I on the Convention on Migratory Species (CMS) which strives towards protecting migratory animals conserving or restoring their habitat and controlling factors that might endanger them (3). It is also on Annex 1 of the Agreement on the Conservation of Albatrosses and Petrels (ACAP) (11). All Amsterdam albatrosses are banded and the population is monitored every year. In 1987 the number of cattle was reduced and a fence erected to partition off part of the island and in 1992 a second fence was built to provide complete protection from cattle in the high plateau (4) (9). Access to the colony by humans is also now under strict control (2). Further proposals include the management of vegetation to increase suitable nesting ground investigation into the impact of cats and means of removing these predators raising awareness of <strong>bycatch</strong> problems amongst longline fishers and research into methods of preventing the spread of disease (4) (10).

The drop in numbers is probably attributable to a range of threats including habitat loss and poaching by hunters who are trafficking exotic animals (2). Most devastating however has been the introduction of alien species (5). Feral dogs first reported in 1994 are known to kill adult iguanas and predation by an exploding population of feral cats on juveniles is responsible for the deaths of many hatchlings each year (2) (5). The primary threat however comes from competition for food from feral livestock with the island teeming with sheep goats donkeys and cattle that have been released to roam freely across Anegada (2) (4). Grazing pressure from these livestock has radically changed the composition of vegetation available to the iguana shifting the speciesâ?? diet to rely more on plants with secondary compounds with dubious nutritional value (2).,The Anegada Iguana Recovery Programme began in 1997 which included establishing a â??headstartâ?? facility. This facility collects hatchlings and nurtures them in captivity until they can be safely released into the wild with the aim of combating the high rates of juvenile mortality due to cat predation by raising them until they are large enough that predation will not pose as great a threat (6). The first 24 were released into the wild in October 2003 with an 84 percent survival rate and a second group of 24 were released in October 2004 and these are currently being tracked (5). In the 1980s small numbers of these iguanas were removed from Anegada and restored to parts of their former range on Guana Island where the species appears to be doing well in the absence of introduced predators (1) (2). The Guana Island Wildlife Sanctuary continues to try to rid the island of sheep the only feral grazing competitor on the island which may improve the habitat there for the iguanas (1). The species was also later introduced to Necker Island (2). A national park designed to protect this Critically Endangered iguana on Anegada has been approved in principle by the Anegada Lands Committee but rampant debates over land ownership and property boundaries impede developments and must be resolved before this project can progress (2) (4). Further conservation actions advocated include a cat eradication programme and the construction of fences around protected areas to keep livestock out. Indeed despite the successes of the headstart programme it is imperative that efforts are made to control livestock and to secure protected land for the survival of this species. Without prompt action it has been suggested that these iguanas may become extinct on Anegada within the next decade (2). ,loss;poaching;pet; ,protected; ,3,1.0

The small numbers caught are utilised for human consumption and possibly also used for oil and fishmeal (5). A more widespread potential threat is the capture of this species as by-catch (5). As they lie on the bottom angel sharks are particularly vulnerable to <strong>by-catch</strong> in trawl fisheries an activity that has increased in the last 50 years. As a result numbers of angel sharks have declined dramatically and have even been declared extinct in the North Sea (1).,All <i>Squatina</i> species are protected within three Balearic Islands marine reserves where fishing for these species is forbidden (1). The status of the angel shark in many parts of its range is unknown (1) and the impact of fisheries is unclear (5) and thus research is required and conservation measures urgently need to be implemented (1) to assure the conservation of this unusual and distinctive shark. , ,protected; ,0,1.0

1015,1015,Panthera pardus nimr,arabian leopard ,Animalia,Chordata,Mammalia,Carnivora,Felidae,Panthera ,Head-and-body length: 1.3 m (2)Male weight: 30 kg (4)Female weight: 20 kg (4),The Arabian leopard clings to a desperately precarious existence. With an official estimate of probably no more than 250 mature individuals and a declining trend this cat edges ever closer to the jaws of extinction (6). Habitat loss poses a serious threat largely as the result of overgrazing by livestock (2) which has also contributed to the depletion of the leopardâ??s prey base (7). Hunting of both the leopard and its prey has also had a dramatic impact on the catâ??s survival contributing to it becoming one of the rarest animals in the world today (4). The leopards in Yemen are under particular pressure from hunting persecution from local shepherds and capture for trade (7) threats that are thought to be the main contributors to the speciesâ?? demise (8). Sadly significant conflict arises from many people considering the leopard to be a threat to their domestic stock (8) with leopards probably often being blamed for kills by wolves and unexplained livestock losses (9).,Fortunately the situation is much more hopeful in Oman than in Yemen with the leopards of the Dhofar Mountains benefiting from comprehensive conservation measures (8). The first significant step to conserve the Arabian leopard was taken in 1985 when the regionâ??s first captive breeding group was established at the Omani Mammal Breeding Centre in Muscat (8). Since then captive breeding efforts at a number of institutions have been successful with several cubs born at the Breeding Centre for Endangered Arabian Wildlife in Sharjah United Arab Emirates. Such captive breeding programmes are essential in maintaining genetic diversity and saving this species from extinction (4). Nevertheless these successes need to be matched by equal successes in conservation efforts <glos><i>in-situ </i></glos>(2) without which potential reintroductions into the wild would be destined to fail (6). ,loss;hunting; ,captive breeding;protected; ,2,2.0
1016,1016,Heosemys depressa,arakan forest turtle ,Animalia,Chordata,Reptilia,Testudines,Bataguridae,Heosemys ,Carapace length: to 26.3 cm (2),The greatest threat thought to face the Arakan forest turtle is over-collection from the wild both for local consumption and commercial export to the Asian food markets particularly those of China and Thailand (5) (7). Not only are these turtles consumed but their shells are also sold for traditional medicinal use (5). Hunting usually involves using trained dogs to search out the turtles but limited burning of bamboo forests to intercept and capture fleeing turtles also takes place. Fortunately the market demand for this species is relatively low and current harvesting levels are thought to be minimal. Extensive tracts of habitat remain and the human population density of the region is amongst the lowest in Southeast Asia (6). Nevertheless habitat loss and degradation may represent additional threats due to logging operations road construction forest clearance for agriculture large-scale bamboo harvesting for a proposed paper mill and uncontrolled forest fires (5) (6). Furthermore this turtleâ??s restricted geographic range low population density late onset of sexual maturity and low reproductive output render it vulnerable to overexploitation (5) (6). These combined threats have left the species in grave danger of extinction so much so that it was officially recognised in 2003 as one of the worldâ??s top 25 most endangered turtles (4).,The Arakan forest turtle is listed as a Protected Species in the Protection of Wildlife Wild Plants and Conservation of Natural Areas Law of Myanmar which was enacted in 1994. Furthermore two large areas in the Arakan Yoma Hill range Thanlwe-ma-e-chaung and Taungup Pass/Thandwe-chaung have been proposed for official protected status. These areas are found just south of known Arakan forest turtle inhabited zones and possess similar habitat types as those currently used by the species (5). This turtle may already occur in the vicinity of these proposed protected areas although no records exist or could potentially be introduced to the regions should they be given protected status. Good numbers of this species exist in captivity where attempts are being made to better understand its biology which could help to guide effective conservation plans or possibly even lead to captive breeding and reintroduction programmes in the future (4). In the meantime captive stock acts as an insurance population that buffers against total extinction. Nevertheless it is imperative that every effort is now made to protect this little-known species which managed to elude detection for so long if we are to prevent it from disappearing from the wild forever. ,loss;hunting; ,captive breeding;protected; ,2,2.0

The chapada region has suffered intense human pressure recently and the locality at which the species was first described has been turned into a recreational park. The species does still occur in the area but the effects of the resulting influx of humans is unknown (4).,The location at which this beautiful bird is found is within the Araripe National Forest and a larger Environmental Protection Area but these designations do not prevent disturbance or exploitation (2). It is imperative that this area is designated as a biological reserve or a national park (2). Thankfully the owner of the land next to the type locality resolved to protect the habitat after this species was discovered. A project supported by the British Petroleum Conservation Leadership Programme is underway to shed light on the ecology of this species and to assess the main threats facing it as well as opportunities for its conservation (4).

1021,1021,Crotalus unicolor,aruba island rattlesnake ,Animalia,Chordata,Reptilia,Squamata,Viperidae,Crotalus ,0.9 - 1.4 kg (2),This species is threatened because it only occurs on one small island where just ten square kilometres of habitat remains undisturbed. In past centuries much of the islandâ??s trees were cut down for charcoal and firewood removing this snake's shelter and prey (6). Recent threats include resort development on the island and other forms of human encroachment. Goats have been introduced and have wreaked havoc on the vegetation. This species is also caught and illegally exported for the pet trade (4).,The Government and people of Aruba do recognise this <strong>endemic</strong> species as important and have set aside a large area of interior land as protected habitat for this and other species (2). The American Zoo and Aquarium Association (AZA) Aruba Island rattlesnake Species Survival Plan (SSP) is currently building on the islandâ??s conservation efforts. Field research is being carried out to determine population size natural history traits and factors affecting the survival of the Aruba Island rattlesnake in order to best inform conservation efforts. There is also an ongoing public relations campaign to change local peopleâ??s perceptions of this venomous snake (6). Captive breeding has also been initiated in zoos associated with the SSP program to increase population numbers and the genetic health of this threatened snake (4) (6). ,pet; ,captive breeding;protected; ,1,2.0
1022,1022,Gyps bengalensis,asian whitebacked vulture ,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Falconiformes,Accipitridae,Gyps ,Length: 75 â?? 85 cm (2),The Asian white-backed vulture was once the commonest vulture in the Indian subcontinent and was abundant throughout its range (4). Populations in South East Asia had all but disappeared by the mid-20th century. These declines have been attributed to direct causes such as hunting and live capture as well as the indirect effects of a reduction in carrion as hygiene improved across the region (5). Having suffered an extremely rapid decline in numbers due to a previously unknown cause the Asian white-backed vulture is in danger of imminent extinction without immediate conservation action. By 2000 dead and dying <i>Gyps</i> vultures were being found so frequently in Nepal and India it was thought that they were suffering from an epidemic. The unnaturally high death toll was thought to be caused by a fatal virus but testing has revealed that vultures are suffering from kidney failure following the consumption of cattle that had previously been treated with the anti-inflammatory drug diclofenac (2). In fact the decline is a result of a lethal level of the drug in a small proportion of the <strong>ungulate</strong> carcasses available to vultures but as vultures travel long distances to reach <strong>carrion</strong> a considerable proportion of the population has been affected (6).,It is necessary to prevent exposure of vultures to livestock carcasses that have been contaminated with diclofenac and to find an alternative replacement drug (7). Government commitment to the control of the use of the drug is crucial but until it has been entirely removed from the environment a collaboration of bird protection organisations plan to take all Asian white-backed vultures into captivity for the next 20 to 30 years to avoid further deaths which would further reduce the chance of a successful recovery of this already rare species (7). ,hunting; , ,1,0.0

Previously capture of this species for the international pet and research trade contributed to population declines but the axolotl now breeds well in captivity alleviating this threat. It was also captured for consumption by local people although numbers are now too low for this. The most significant threat to the axolotl is the increasing pollution of the lakes and canal system as Mexico City continues to grow (1). Land drainage flood control and sewage disposal methods from the 17th century to the present have all contributed to the destruction of the water system of Mexico City (3).,Recent stabilisation of axolotl numbers may be attributable to the restoration of the Parco Ecologico Xochimilco over the last 20 years.

The main threat causing the decline of this species in recent years is illegal fishing using electricity which has accounted for 40 percent of known deaths. The dolphins have also become caught in fishing gear and engineering explosions used to keep navigation channels open are another source of mortality. Vessels carrying pesticides occasionally overturn causing poisoning of the ecosystem resulting in further deaths (6). An additional source of pollution comes from the 15.6 billion cubic meters of wastewater discharged into the Yangtze every year 80 percent of which is not treated. A huge volume of boat traffic uses the river; noise levels are high and boat strikes a possibility. Furthermore the banks of the Yangtze have been greatly modified in order to prevent flooding of adjacent land; such projects have great impacts on the ecosystem both during construction and from the resulting habitat changes. Dam construction has been shown to reduce the availability of fish which is exacerbated by over-fishing and pollution. The recent construction of the infamous Three Gorges Dam the largest dam in the world is likely to affect fish stocks and natural flooding patterns (2). For many years the baiji population is thought to have been very small which in itself may have caused serious problems; small populations often suffer low genetic fitness and are often less able to adapt to environmental changes (2).,In Chinese folklore the baiji is dubbed â??Goddess of the Yangtzeâ?? a beneficent animal once revered by the fishing people of the river. The species was declared a National Treasure of China and has been a protected species since 1975 (3). However this had very little effect on the population which continued to decline despite conservation efforts and legal protection. It was thought that the only chance to save the species from extinction would be to remove all of the surviving individuals from the Yangtze into the â??Baiji Semi-natural Reserveâ?? which was created in 1992 (6). However since the unsuccessful search for any surviving baijis in 2006 it is unlikely that a captive breeding programme will now ever be possible (4). The World Conservation Union (IUCN) has now classified the baiji as Critically Endangered (Possibly Extinct); it cannot be definitively classified as Extinct until further surveys are undertaken (1). Sadly it seems that this goddess of the Yangtze will be the first <strong>cetacean</strong> species to become extinct in modern times as a result of human activities (5). ,fishing;environmental;environment;pollution; ,captive breeding;protected; ,4,2.0

The main threat causing the decline of this species in recent years is illegal fishing using electricity which has accounted for 40 percent of known deaths. The dolphins have also become caught in fishing gear and engineering explosions used to keep navigation channels open are another source of mortality. Vessels carrying pesticides occasionally overturn causing poisoning of the ecosystem resulting in further deaths (6). An additional source of pollution comes from the 15.6 billion cubic meters of wastewater discharged into the Yangtze every year 80 percent of which is not treated. A huge volume of boat traffic uses the river; noise levels are high and boat strikes a possibility. Furthermore the banks of the Yangtze have been greatly modified in order to prevent flooding of adjacent land; such projects have great impacts on the ecosystem both during construction and from the resulting habitat changes. Dam construction has been shown to reduce the availability of fish which is exacerbated by over-fishing and pollution. The recent construction of the infamous Three Gorges Dam the largest dam in the world is likely to affect fish stocks and natural flooding patterns (2). For many years the baiji population is thought to have been very small which in itself may have caused serious problems; small populations often suffer low genetic fitness and are often less able to adapt to environmental changes (2).,In Chinese folklore the baiji is dubbed â??Goddess of the Yangtzeâ?? a beneficent animal once revered by the fishing people of the river.

1034,1034,Puffinus mauretanicus,balearic shearwater ,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Procellariiformes,Procellariidae,Puffinus ,Length: c. 33 cm (2),The Balearic shearwater is the most threatened seabird in the Mediterranean and one of the rarest seabirds in the world (8) (10). Indeed with an annual decline estimated at around eight percent this highly threatened seabird could go extinct within the next 40 years (10). At present the greatest threat to the Balearic shearwater is thought to be unnatural adult mortality (11) (12). On land this may be caused by predation by introduced cats rats and genets (<em>Geneta geneta</em>) and the species may have gone extinct on Cabrera Island as a result (6). At sea this species has a close association with trawlers from which it takes fish discards and mass mortality has been observed where fish lines have come too close to large groups of birds (2). ,Recognising the tragic fate of the Balearic shearwater the Balearic Government introduced a recovery plan in 1997 which aimed to increase the population and its distribution to all suitable areas of habitat (6). The implementation of this plan has seen the eradication of rats from several nesting sites and the creation of three Special Protected Areas which protect all nesting areas (2). However despite these efforts addressing the high rate of mortality at sea remains a crucial factor in avoiding the extinction of this species (10).

1039,1039,Acanthophoenix rubra,barbel palm ,Plantae,Tracheophyta,Liliopsida,Arecales,Palmae,Acanthophoenix ,Height: up to 12 m (2),As a result of uncontrolled harvesting of palm heart as well as clearance for sugarcane plantations on RÃ©union the historically common wild populations of barbel palm have been reduced to small fragments which are perilously close to extinction (1) (2). The total wild population is believed to number just 1300 reproductive individuals with only 100 existing on Mauritius. The threat to this species is further compounded by the fact that its reproduction success and reestablishment is very poor. The reasons for this are currently unclear but are likely to be due to consumption of the palmâ??s fruit and seedlings by introduced animals such as rats and pigs (2) (3).,In order to help preserve wild populations of barbel palm the Office National des ForÃªts on RÃ©union has undertaken an extensive restoration programme (3). Their efforts may be aided by the recent discovery of a large population of this species on Rodrigues which has the potential to provide an abundance of plant material to establish new stocks (2) (3). , , ,0,0.0
1040,1040,Aloe pillansii,bastard quiver tree ,Plantae,Tracheophyta,Liliopsida,Liliales,Asphodelaceae,Aloe ,Height: up to 10 m (2),Recent surveys of the bastard quiver tree in the Richtersveld region of the Northern Cape Province of South Africa as well as in Namibia suggest that there has been very little successful reproduction in the last 100 years. In addition many of the older trees are dying indicating that the population does not appear to be naturally regenerating (5) (7). The rarity of the bastard quiver tree may be partly attributed to their habitat; in harsh environments the problems of survival are amplified (5). Similar declines in population regeneration in sister species <i>Aloe dichotoma</i> (the quiver tree) have been attributed to climate change (8) and it is very likely that the bastard quiver tree is being affected similarly. These effects are worsened by the removal of plants by horticultural collectors as well as through herbivory by baboon porcupines rock rabbits and livestock which also trample young plants (4) (5) (7). Populations may also be affected by damage caused by leaf scale insects and by base metal mining in Namibia (9).,Bastard quiver trees are protected in South Africa and Namibia (10) and are listed on Appendix I of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) effectively banning international trade in wild plants of this species (1). Further research into this important species is vitally needed together with the careful monitoring of existing populations (5).

Recently there has been an increase in the market for turtle meat and eggs in Asia and the resulting unsustainable harvest has pushed many species to the brink of extinction (7). It is estimated that batugars in Malaysia declined by over 90% during the 20th Century (8) and the species is now considered to be Critically Endangered (1).,These turtles are listed on Appendix I of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) (3); international trade is thus prohibited although illegal collection is still widespread (1). The Bronx Zoo in New York has recently achieved the first captive breeding of batagurs and this may offer a glimmer of hope for the survival of this fascinating turtle (5).  ,loss; ,cites;captive breeding; ,1,2.0

In some areas the effects of intense habitat disturbance are exacerbated by hunting pressure (11); bearded sakis are hunted for <strong>bushmeat</strong> (12) and their tails are reportedly used as dusters (7).  This perilous combination of habitat destruction and hunting along with the bearded sakiâ??s specialised diet and preference for undisturbed forest (7) has led some to regard the bearded saki as the most endangered primate in the Amazon (4).,The bearded saki is listed on Appendix II of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) meaning that any international trade in this species should be carefully monitored (3).

Grasslands throughout its range are threatened by drainage conversion to agriculture overgrazing heavy flooding and inappropriate cutting and burning regimes (6).  The Tonle Sap grasslands an extremely important area for breeding Bengal floricans have declined by 60 percent since the late 1990s with the intensification of rice cultivation playing a significant role in this loss in recent years (7).  However not all human activity should be looked upon as negative as many grasslands in the absence of large native herbivores rely on activities such as grazing and burning for their existence (7).  Unfortunately reaching the correct balance of human activities is not an easy task and the management of many grasslands even those within protected areas results in habitat unsuitable for the Bengal florican (8).,The Bengal florican occurs in a number of protected areas including the Royal Chitwan National Park and Royal Bardia National Park in Nepal (8) Dudwa National Park in India and possibly in Tram Chim National Park Vietnam and Ang Trapeang Thmor Sarus Crane Conservation Area in Cambodia (6).  Within some of these areas efforts are underway to maintain the valuable grasslands such as uprooting woody vegetation (8) and a schedule of controlled fires and the collection of cut grass by locals for thatch (8) (10).  This will help create more suitable habitat for the Bengal florican (8) provided that burning and cutting is carried out before the breeding season otherwise these activities could be detrimental to the eggs or young birds (4) (10).  The worrying loss of grassland habitat in the Tonle Sap led to the designation in 2006 of 310 square kilometres of land as Integrated Farming and Biodiversity Areas.  Within these areas large scale habitat conversion is forbidden but extensive traditional use is encouraged (7). ,loss;hunting; ,protected; ,2,1.0

Unfortunately reaching the correct balance of human activities is not an easy task and the management of many grasslands even those within protected areas results in habitat unsuitable for the Bengal florican (8).,The Bengal florican occurs in a number of protected areas including the Royal Chitwan National Park and Royal Bardia National Park in Nepal (8) Dudwa National Park in India and possibly in Tram Chim National Park Vietnam and Ang Trapeang Thmor Sarus Crane Conservation Area in Cambodia (6).  Within some of these areas efforts are underway to maintain the valuable grasslands such as uprooting woody vegetation (8) and a schedule of controlled fires and the collection of cut grass by locals for thatch (8) (10).  This will help create more suitable habitat for the Bengal florican (8) provided that burning and cutting is carried out before the breeding season otherwise these activities could be detrimental to the eggs or young birds (4) (10).  The worrying loss of grassland habitat in the Tonle Sap led to the designation in 2006 of 310 square kilometres of land as Integrated Farming and Biodiversity Areas.  Within these areas large scale habitat conversion is forbidden but extensive traditional use is encouraged (7). ,loss;hunting; ,protected; ,2,1.0

It is estimated that the number of Biznaguitas in the wild has declined by as much as 75% since its discovery in the mid-1980s principally as a result of over-collection (1). ,In recognition of the worrying population decline the Biznaguita was upgraded to Critically Endangered on the World Conservation Union's (IUCN) 2002 Red List of Threatened Species (1). This cactus is listed on Appendix II of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) (3) thus restricting trade in wild plants; however a greater enforcement of these restrictions is required if this attractive cactus is to remain in the wild (1). , ,cites; ,0,1.0
1055,1055,Haliotis cracherodii,black abalone ,Animalia,Mollusca,Gastropoda,Archaeogastropoda,Haliotidae,Haliotis ,Length: 20 cm (2),The black abalone has suffered a serious decline since 1985 due to a disease known as withering syndrome which spread through the California Channel Islands between 1985 and 1992. It causes wasting of the foot muscle preventing the abalone from properly adhering to a rock causing the abalone to become discoloured lose weight and die. Population losses in each area ranged from 20% to total (1).,All abalone fisheries in California are managed by the California Department of Fish and Game which restricts the size of abalones caught and the season in which harvesting can take place. In Mexico there is a total allowable catch limit for black abalones. The black abalone is a candidate species on the US Endangered Species Act and whilst this could be beneficial in the future it does not currently give the species any legal protection (1). ,loss;fishing;disease; ,endangered species act; ,3,1.0
1056,1056,Diceros bicornis,black rhinoceros ,Animalia,Chordata,Mammalia,Perissodactyla,Rhinocerotidae,Diceros ,800 - 1400 kg (2),Black rhinoceros have been poached to the brink of extinction due to the demand for their horn both for use in Chinese traditional medicine and for traditional dagger handles in Yemen the demand for which exploded in the 1970s due to the increased income of oil-rich Gulf States (7). It is estimated that between 1970 and 1992 around 96 percent of the black rhinoceros population was lost (8).,The population crash in the latter half of the 20th Century saw rhinoceros numbers plummet to a low of about 2400 individuals (4). A variety of conservation approaches have been adopted which have resulted in the stabilisation and partial recovery of populations in a number of countries. The most successful have involved the rigorous protection of rhinoceros in fenced sanctuaries often in partnerships between the State and private sectors or in intensely protected unfenced zones within larger areas (4). Dehorning has also been used in some countries to reduce the incentives to poach (4). In 1997 Yemen became a signatory of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) thus greatly reducing the demand for rhinoceros horn in the Middle East (7). By 2001 the continental black rhinoceros population had increased to 3100 with populations in six of the eight range states increasing (4). Most individuals are conserved in heavily protected areas. The African Rhino Specialist Group of the World Conservation Union (IUCN) provides advice on the conservation of African rhinoceros and has developed a detailed Action Plan which provides extensive information and strategic direction for their conservation (4). , ,cites;protected; ,0,2.0
1057,1057,Stereolepis gigas,black sea bass ,Animalia,Chordata,Actinopterygii,Perciformes,Polyprionidae,Stereolepis ,up to 255.6 kg (2),The black sea bass has been massively over-fished in both California and Mexican waters leaving this water giant Critically Endangered. Indeed so dramatic were these declines that between 1932 and 1980 commercial landings diminished from 115 tonnes biomass to 5 tonnes in Californian waters and from 363 tonnes to 12 tonnes in Mexican waters. The speciesâ?? limited distribution large size and aggregation in spawning areas made it an easy target for fisheries (1). Unfortunately its slow growth and late onset of sexual maturity make the fish extremely vulnerable to population collapses from over-fishing and slow to recover (5). Additionally it appears that the black sea bass may also be suffering from toxin poisoning. Sediments along the coast of California have been found to carry very high levels of toxins such as DDE and PCB with an area off the Palos Verdes peninsula thought to contain possibly the highest loads of DDE (a breakdown product of DDT) in the worldâ??s oceans. The toxins cannot be broken down so as a mid-level predator black sea bass ingest the cumulative toxins in increased concentrations from the food chain below it and have been found to be carrying extremely high body burdens of DDE and PCB in southern California. The chemicals have been recorded to interfere with normal reproductive biology in other species of fish as well as amphibians reptiles and birds but more research is needed into the effects they are having on this giant fish and its process of recovery in California (3).,The black sea bass has been protected in California since 1981 and in Mexico since 1992. Both commercial and recreational fishing of this species were prohibited in California in 1981 although two fish per angler per trip are allowed to be caught south of the U.S.-Mexican border and one fish per trip to be taken incidentally by commercial fishermen. The law also limited the amount of black sea bass that could be caught in Mexican waters and landed in California (1). Although these laws have prevented commercial fishermen from targeting and profiting from these fish they have failed to protect the habitats occupied by the species from fishing and have probably done little to reduce incidental mortality since black sea bass entangled in nets have simply been discarded back into the sea (5). Indeed many fish in spawning aggregations in the summer have been caught and released frequently receiving injuries in the process (6). However the banning of gill nets in California in 1990 has probably helped significantly reduce the incidental mortality of this species and anecdotal data suggest that numbers may be beginning to rebound (1) (5). Nevertheless either voluntary or imposed seasonal and/or area closures would undoubtedly help further minimise incidental mortalities and greatly aid the recovery of this magnificent and dramatic giant of the sea (3) (6). ,fishing; ,protected; ,1,1.0

When human activities encroach upon rainforest habitat this species is one of the first lemurs to disappear (1). Hunting also threatens this rare primate; unfortunately its large size and daylight activity pattern makes it an attractive target and it is among the most heavily hunted of all Madagascarâ??s lemurs (1).,The black-and-white ruffed lemur occurs in a number of protected areas such as Mananara-Nord National Park Zahamena National Park and Mantadia National Park. Although sadly this Critically Endangered species has also vanished from other areas such as Analamazaotra Special Reserve and Andringitra National Park and other forests urgently require protection if this species is to survive (1). The black-and-white lemur has been the subject of captive breeding efforts with a number being reintroduced to Madagascarâ??s Betampona Reserve between 1997 and 2001 (1) (9). Unfortunately this has had limited success as animals that have not grown up in the wild typically have great difficulty adapting (9). Reintroduction is a long and costly process (9) and is rendered worthless if there is no safe natural habitat in which they can be released into. Thus hopefully efforts to protect Madagascarâ??s habitats by numerous conservation organisations will be successful. ,loss;hunting; ,captive breeding;protected; ,2,2.0

A victim of extensive habitat loss this rare monkey survives in highly fragmented relict populations each numbering no more than 50 individuals (1). The blond titi monkey is only found in the Atlantic forests of Brazil a region characterised by intensive habitat conversion and degradation. Despite only ten percent of original forest remaining urban and agricultural encroachment and the development of coffee and sugarcane plantations continue to threaten the area. Rapid urbanisation also threatens the blond titi monkey through road collisions electrocution on power lines and predation by domestic pets. It may also be captured for use as pets (1).,Despite being home to numerous species found nowhere else in the world only one percent of the forests of Bahia home to the blond titi monkey are under any form of protection (9). As a number of destructive activities continue to degrade the area action is urgently required to protect the blond titi monkeyâ??s habitat. Thankfully several organisations including the Brazilian Institute for the Environment are working to promote the study and protection of Brazilâ??s threatened primates (10). Conservation International is also helping to establish a Central Biodiversity Corridor that aims to connect fragmented forests while WWF is developing an overall conservation strategy for Brazilâ??s Atlantic forests (9) (11).

Many areas are being drained dredged filled or flooded for urban development agriculture and pond and reservoir construction (4) (5). The loss and alteration of suitable habitat increases the risk of bog turtles being killed on roads and leaves them more exposed to predation (5). The impact of this habitat loss on bog turtle populations is being compounded by the illegal wildlife trade (5) as unfortunately the small size unique colouration and rarity of this turtle makes it highly valued in the pet trade (4).,Bog turtles are legally protected or regulated in nearly all states in which they occur (2) but most of these regulations relate just to the species and do not provide protection to its habitat (5).

Logging not only removes lichen substrate but also alters the microclimate of the forest a factor to which this species is particularly susceptible (4). Owing to the impacts of habitat loss and air pollution the Atlantic population has declined by more than 90 percent over the past two decades (2) (3).,The Atlantic population of the boreal felt lichen is protected in Canada under the Federal Species at Risk Act (SARA) and is the focus of an ongoing recovery strategy (2). Crucially efforts are being made through land purchases and agreements with landowners to formally protect areas of forest that are home to this rare species (2) (3).

However the main threat to orangutans today is loss of habitat. In the past twenty years 80 percent of orangutan habitat has been lost to illegal logging gold mining and conversion to permanent agriculture in particular oil palm plantations.

Dam-building has also flooded suitable habitat especially in Brazil and Paraguay (4) and intensifying ecotourism activities such as rafting may become another threat in the future (3). Other threats include inbreeding hunting competition forest fires egg-collecting pesticides and predation (7). Fewer than 250 birds are thought to remain in the world with the vast majority in Brazil. In Argentina where very few individuals survive and extinction may be imminent hunting and collection of exhibition specimens is believed to have contributed to the speciesâ?? decline (4).,This extremely rare bird occurs in three Brazilian national parks and in Argentina sections of the Arroyo UruzÃº are also protected within the UruguaÃ­ Provincial Park (4). Commercial diamond extraction was banned in the Serra da Canastra area in Brazil in 1996 (7). A Brazilian Merganser Recovery Team has been set up and a Brazilian Merganser action plan has been created which details priority conservation projects (8) (9). In line with these plans the Brazilian NGO Terra Brasilis has initiated a conservation program the worldâ??s most important site Serra da Canastra National Park in South Central Brazil (8) (9). The programme involves collecting basic information needed to adequately protect the species such as studies of its breeding ecology and an inventory of its distribution within the Canastra range as well as environmental education in both urban and rural areas (schoolchildren teachers farmers and other local people) and a campaign to market the species presence with the aim of ultimately making it a flagship species for the region (9). Nevertheless even despite these efforts there is a very real possibility of extinction in the wild becoming a reality and without being established in captivity this rare species would be lost to the world forever. ,loss;hunting;pet;pollution; ,protected; ,4,1.0

Compounding the threat of hunting is the impact of habitat loss; in Colombia it has been estimated that 30 percent of <em>Ateles fusciceps rufiventrisâ?? </em>habitat has been lost in the last ten years (1) and the population size of <em>Ateles fusciceps fusciceps</em> has decreased by 80 percent as a result of habitat loss (6). ,Hunting of the brown-headed spider monkey is prohibited in Ecuador (5) and it also receives some protection from international trade under its listing on Appendix II of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) which means that any international trade in this species should be carefully regulated (4)<strong>.  </strong>This species also occurs in several protected areas including Los Cedros Protected Forest in Ecuador and Los Katios Natural National Park in Colombia (1) which should hopefully protect some populations from the threat of habitat loss. ,loss;hunting; ,cites;captive breeding;protected; ,2,3.0

Historically this species was considered a pest and over three million were killed between 1880 and 1920 for bounty money (7). The introduction of predators and competitors such as foxes cats rats and rabbits combined with habitat reduction from farming and altered burning regimes have all had detrimental effects on the species (2).,The Critically Endangered brush-tailed bettong is reliant on the monitoring and reduction of fox populations as well as careful habitat management for its survival (7). Research is currently underway to identify possible new <strong>translocation</strong> sites (1) and an investigation is being carried out by the Woylie Conservation Research Project to discover why all large brush-tailed bettong populations across Australia dramatically declined in 2001. Predation disease and food availability are the main areas under investigation (1) and hopefully the findings will enable the prevention of further declines in the future. ,pet; , ,1,0.0
1079,1079,Geochelone platynota,burmese starred tortoise ,Animalia,Chordata,Reptilia,Testudines,Testudinidae,Geochelone ,Carapace length: 26 cm (2),Like many turtles and tortoises of Southeast Asia the Burmese star tortoise has undergone dramatic declines due to the increasing demand in the Asian market in which it is sold for its meat and perceived medicinal value (9). Although â??subsistenceâ?? gathering of the species has occurred for hundreds of years by native people together with collection for its yellow-rayed <strong>carapace</strong> which is used for a container for cooking oil seeds etc. the impact was relatively small and sustainable. In recent years however subsistence has been replaced by mass commercial harvesting as the price of this species skyrocketed in the Asian markets (primarily Taiwan and China) (8). The tortoise has also been hard hit recently by the illegal international pet trade often ending up in European and North American collections (9). With their distinctive markings and dramatic colours these tortoises are attractive to collectors and their rarity makes them particularly valuable (10). Indeed adults can fetch up to US$7000 each from private collectors in the Western world (10) and this high price and demand encourages overexploitation of wild populations (5). Habitat destruction and wild fires also pose a threat to these tortoises particularly to smaller individuals (5).,The Burmese star tortoise exists in two protected areas Shwe Settaw Wildlife Sanctuary and Minzontaung Wildlife Sanctuary and an area proposed for protected status Myaleik Taung. At the Minzontaung Wildlife Sanctuary and Myaleik Taung the species is protected by local religious beliefs that deem it bad luck to collect the tortoises and commercial poaching is so far virtually non-existent. The Sanctuary is also well patrolled by guards with access strictly controlled and wild fires are managed. The Minzontaung Wildlife Sanctuary and Myaleik Taung therefore offer excellent potential for the successful conservation of the Burmese star tortoise (5). Sadly the Shwe Settaw Wildlife Sanctuary does not seem to be faring so well which has recently been reduced by around 30% due to the sale of a large tract to an agricultural development consortium. Subsistence and commercial harvest from the Sanctuary is commonplace with one village trader admitting to collecting 300 individuals in 6 months and there being at least one trader in every village. The Burmese star tortoise is fully protected by law and it is a capital offence to remove them from the wild. However the Myanmar Government reportedly ignore the capture and sale of these tortoises or are easily bribed with rampant civil war and radical guerrilla soldiers near the borders deterring police involvement there. A captive breeding programme has been set up at the Shwe Settaw Wildlife Sanctuary but hybridisation with <i>Indotestudo elongata</i> in a shared fenced area has been common. There is also evidence that this area is quickly grazed and tortoises here starve to death at an alarming rate. Stricter enforcement of protection laws is desperately needed and more effective management protocols at this Sanctuary but as long as a lucrative market exists tortoise hunting is likely to remain an attractive economic option for rural people (8). One suggestion has been to promote the significance of rural religious beliefs for the benefit of tortoise conservation in this area which has helped protect this beautiful species so effectively in the Minzontaung Wildlife Sanctuary and Myaleik Taung (5).

1096,1096,Attalea crassispatha,carossier palm ,Plantae,Tracheophyta,Liliopsida,Arecales,Palmae,Attalea ,Hieght: up to 20 m (2),The conversion of habitat for agriculture has had a severe impact on <em>A. crassispatha</em> with slash and burn practices being especially unfavourable to natural regeneration (3) (4). In 1996 there were estimated to be less than 30 individuals remaining in the wild (1) (4) (5). Grazing by livestock on fruits and seedlings and a reduction in the abundance of seed dispersal agents is now limiting its ability to recover. Furthermore local people commonly harvest the immature seeds for food and cooking oil and the durable and insect resistant trunks are occasionally used in construction (3) (4) (5). Given the small size of its population <em>A. crassispatha</em> is also vulnerable to extreme natural events such as hurricanes (4) (5).,Conservation efforts for <em>A. crassispatha</em> have largely concentrated on planting palms and collecting seeds from adult plants in the wild (4). Probably the largest collection of the species is maintained at Fairchild Tropical Botanic Garden Miami Florida USA. However most of the palms in the collection are still too young to flower or fruit and of the few reproductively mature plants none have produced viable seed. As a result further research is needed to determine the possible causes of reproductive failure (5). During the 1990s numerous seedlings of <em>A. crassispatha</em> were also planted on the grounds of public buildings and private residences in Haiti in an effort to develop in-country <em>ex-situ</em> collections (4) (5). Unfortunately an assessment of the status of these seedlings is long overdue. , , ,0,0.0

The native forests of the island were rapidly cleared as far back as the 1890s and a century later barely 0.03 percent or 15 square kilometres of the original forest cover remained (2). The rediscovery of the Cebu flowerpecker was unexpected because of the almost total loss of its habitat but what tiny forest patches do remain are still under threat from illegal settlement and logging road construction shifting cultivation firewood collection charcoal making and clearance for mining. In addition competition with the red-striped flowerpecker (<em>Dicaeum australe</em>) may have exacerbated the speciesâ?? decline. With a population estimated at only around 100 individuals (as of 2009) and with a highly fragmented range totalling just 8 square kilometres the future of this small bird is highly uncertain (2) (3) (4) (7).,The Cebu flowerpecker has been the focus of a number of conservation efforts since its rediscovery. In 2009 it was chosen as the flagship species for the British Birdwatching Fair the largest fair of its kind in the world and the Philippines Department of Tourism has also pledged support for the species including financial support for conservation efforts by the Cebu Biodiversity Conservation Foundation (5) (8). Conservation actions for the species have so far included habitat rehabilitation attempts to control timber poaching and forest clearance the planting of corridors to link remaining forest patches and research into the flowerpeckerâ??s ecology. One site where the Cebu flowerpecker occurs the Nug-as Forest is managed and protected and local forest wardens regularly patrol both this and Dalaguete forest patches. A further site that may hold the species Malabuyoc is within the borders of a cement company reserve while another Mt. Lantoy has been declared a Watershed Forest Reserve (2) (4).

The <strong>colonies</strong> of Chatham Island itself are plagued by humans cattle pigs sheep cats dogs weka (<i>Gallirallus australis</i>) and brush-tailed possums (<i>Trichosurus vulpecula</i>). Disturbance is thought to cause the birds to trample on their nests; breaking the eggs before abandoning the site. Breeding sites have also been abandoned following the arrival of the fur seal (<i>Arctocephalus forsteri</i>) on Star Keys Island. Small numbers of birds are shot or caught in crayfish pots and it is thought that changes in the marine environment may have affected the availability of fish species (2).,A census of the Chatham Island shag was taken in 1997 and a follow-up was done in 2003-2004 as part of the Chatham Island Shag and Pitt Island Shag Recovery Plan that was brought into effect in 2001. It recommends that the population as a whole is surveyed every five years but that a closer eye is kept on the colonies of Chatham Island with a census each year. Authorities are hoping to come to an agreement with local land and stock owners that would enable fences to be built around breeding <strong>colonies</strong>. Dog owners need to be educated as to the effect their pets can have on the Chatham Island shag and eco-tourists must be similarly supervised. It may be necessary to gain legal protection for all colonies (2). ,environment; , ,1,0.0

Forests were initially cut down for timber and later to make room for the rapidly expanding cattle ranches and sugar plantations. The rate of deforestation increased dramatically in the 19<sup>th</sup>and 20<sup>th</sup>centuries due to rapid population and economic growth and an increased demand for charcoal and firewood. The legacy of such a destructive history is that tragically today less than 10 percent of the Atlantic forest remains. Consequently many of the species within this region are seriously threatened with extinction (6) (7). One such species the cherry-throated tanager now has a critically small population probably no more than 250 individuals and a very patchy distribution (2). The future of this rare species is threatened by further loss to what little habitat remains through urban and agricultural encroachment and timber extraction (4) (8).,The survival of the Critically Endangered cherry-throated tanager is perilously bound to the future management of two privately owned forests in which the last remaining populations are found (2) (3) (4).

1111,1111,Sterna bernsteini,chinese crested tern ,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Charadriiformes,Laridae,Sterna ,Length: 42 cm (2),The specific threats facing this exceptionally rare bird have not yet been identified but a range of environmental issues are known to affect other species within its range and are therefore highly plausible threats to the Chinese crested tern (4). Offshore islets which appear to be the key nesting areas of this species are thought to be relatively safe from human disturbance. However other coastal wetlands in the Chinese crested ternâ??s presumed breeding range in eastern China have been affected by large-scale development projects (4) (6). Seabirds are also hunted and exploited for food in China. Indeed the main threat to the newly discovered population on the Mazu Dao islands is from fishermen from mainland China who visit the nesting islets to collect seashells and bird eggs. Other potential threats include the introduction of rats and cats to currently predator-free offshore islands oil pollution and contamination of estuarine areas by industrial and agricultural pollutants and human disturbance (6).,The Mazu Dao islands were declared as the National Matzu Nature Reserve for Terns in 2000 offering some protection to the birds there (4) (6). The most recent sighting of the Chinese crested tern in China was from Huanghe Sanjiaozhou Nature Reserve in Shandong in 1991 and several other protected areas exist along the Chinese coast where this species may occur (4). The Chinese crested tern is nationally protected in China and Thailand and the area where it was once recorded in Thailand is protected as the Laem Talumphuk Non-Hunting Area (4) (6). Further studies are certainly needed to better understand this species including its range what sort of breeding success it is having the exact threats it faces and its protection needs (7). One suggested measure which has been successful elsewhere is to give local people a vested interest in seeing the terns remain alive perhaps by allowing or encouraging fishermen to take birdwatchers to see the rare seabirds rather than collecting their eggs (7). Thus special boat trips have now been made available from Matsu Island to the National Matsu Nature Reserve for Terns during the months of June and July for NT$350 (approx. US$11). Landing on the nesting island is not permitted and viewing is from the boat at a safe distance so that the terns are not disturbed but this revenue may help protect the Chinese crested tern by making it more valuable alive than dead (5). ,environmental;environment;pollution; ,protected; ,3,1.0

Other threats include habitat alteration and loss; deforestation causes soil erosion and increased runoff and silting in rivers. The building of dams in China over the years has also changed the natural river flow in some areas where the Chinese giant salamander is found. Local pesticides fertilizers and pollutants are also thought to affect the health of this amphibian though little research has been conducted. Symptoms of these recent threats include the lower numbers of Chinese giant salamanders recorded with smaller populations and also smaller individuals (4).,The Chinese giant salamander is now protected from international trade by its listing on Appendix I of the Convention of International Trade of Endangered Species (CITES) (3). Since the 1980s 14 nature reserves with a total area of more than 355000 hectares have been established for the conservation of the Chinese giant salamander (7). This includes a huge 99975 hectare area of Mount Wuyi China which was designated as a World Heritage Site in 1999 dedicated to conserving this biodiverse region including the habitat of this salamander (8). The surrounding area has a growing population and the establishment of this reserve will protect many species. However there are still concerns that development around the reserve and tourism plans within the reserve will place pressure on Mount Wuyiâ??s rich resources healthy rivers and habitats. Conservation efforts to protect this habitat and other areas where the ancient Chinese giant salamander is found are essential for the survival of this species and many others (8). ,loss;hunting; ,cites;protected; ,2,2.0

Although having been hunted by local people for subsistence for centuries recent changes in Asian economics have opened up direct access to foreign markets in which turtles and tortoises are favoured for their meat and perceived medicinal value (10). The Chinese three-striped box turtle has suffered particularly badly because of recent claims that its <strong>plastron</strong> contains medicinal properties that can cure cancer which has driven up the demand and therefore price bringing this species to the edge of extinction (2). Additionally this rare turtle is highly sought after by the pet trade with adults fetching up to US$3000 each (6) (9). Such a high market value inevitably leads to over-collection from the wild. Indeed some Chinese can attain enough money to build a house from the sale of a single adult Chinese three-striped box turtle an extremely powerful incentive (6).,In 2001 a programme on the conservation of wild fauna and flora and the establishment of nature reserves was begun in China. Many new nature reserves have been created some of which offer habitat for tortoises and freshwater turtles (11). This species is protected by law in Hong Kong under the Wild Animals Protection Ordinance Cap. 170. under which collection of any wild turtles is prohibited unless under a special permit obtained from the Agricultural Fisheries and Conservation Department (7). Individuals employed by the Agricultural Fisheries and Conservation Department of Hong Kong also patrol protected territories to curb illegal hunting of native tortoises and freshwater turtles (11). Various captive breeding programmes for this species exist around the world (12) but this Department is also implementing a captive breeding project with a local conservation organisation that includes plans for subsequent reintroductions into the wild (11). ,pet; ,captive breeding;protected; ,1,2.0
1116,1116,Fregata andrewsi,christmas frigatebird ,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Pelecaniformes,Fregatidae,Fregata ,Length: 89 - 100 cm (2),Habitat destruction and human predation have been the major causes of population decline in the past (6); dust pollution from phosphate mine driers caused one major nesting site to be abandoned (4). Dust suppression equipment has since been installed and human predation has ceased since this species has been protected (4). Birds that have been displaced in the past may now be using sub-optimal habitat which could pose a threat to their survival (4). The Christmas frigatebird is confined to a few breeding <strong>colonies</strong> on a single island and this together with their low reproductive rate (4) makes the population alarmingly vulnerable to any chance event.,Christmas Island National Park was established in 1989 and contains two of the three current breeding populations of this species (5). Christmas frigatebirds are also protected outside of the park and by Migratory Bird Agreements between Australia and other countries (4). This species remains highly vulnerable however and the close monitoring of breeding success and population size remains a high priority (4). ,pollution; ,protected; ,1,1.0

Vast tracts of the ancient forest have been lost. Today high-intensity fires represent the biggest threat to survival and groves of dead sliver trees ravaged by fire stand out starkly against the landscape (6).

A concerted conservation programme to save this ancient giant is now in place and a 5252-hectare area has been set aside as a Cedar Reserve (6). Within the reserve fires are managed and controlled in order to prevent high-intensity summer fires from sweeping through the area.

These fish are accidentally caught on lines whilst local fisherman search the deep waters for other species (6). Due to the likely slow reproduction rate and small number of offspring of coelacanths the species is possibly particularly vulnerable to the removal of pregnant females from the population (6).,The coelacanth is protected from international trade by its listing on Appendix I of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) (1). Fishermen of the Grand Comoro Island have also imposed a voluntary ban on fishing in areas where coelacanths (or â??gombessaâ?? as they are known locally) exist (5) in a vital effort to save their countryâ??s most unique fauna. The Coelacanth Rescue Mission is also distributing Deep Release Kits to local fishermen which provide an effective method of returning accidentally caught fish to their deep habitat (3). There have recently been encouraging signs that the Comoros population is now stable (5) although careful monitoring will be needed to ensure this living fossil survives into the next millennium. , ,cites;protected; ,0,2.0

The unusual life cycle of the corroboree frog makes it particularly vulnerable; only one small clutch is laid in a year and tadpoles have a long development time (4). The precise causes of this sudden decline are unclear but a number of factors may be involved including habitat destruction by ski resort development and trampling by humans and livestock (6). However it is now widely accepted that chytrid fungus is a major (if not the primary) cause of their continuous decline (9).,A Recovery Plan for the corroboree frog has been published by the National Parks and Wildlife Service of New South Wales (5). This plan identifies the urgent need for more population data and investigation into the cause of the continuing decline in numbers. Research into captive breeding techniques will also be undertaken (5). In the short term the plan aims to halt the precipitous decline of this species and then work to restore this colourful frog to much of its former range (5). , ,captive breeding; ,0,1.0

After another hurricane in 1995 no thrashers were found in annual surveys until an individual was discovered in 2004 (2). The devastating effect of hurricanes remains a primary threat to any remaining small population. However it is believed other threats must have contributed to the decline of this species as it is likely to have survived hurricanes for millions of years. Introduced predators especially boas which were released onto the island in 1971 may have had a significant impact on Cozumel thrashers (4). Whilst large areas of forest remain on Cozumel Island the ubiquitous threat of human development and associated habitat loss and degradation is likely to increase pressures on this critically endangered species (3) (4).,Research is currently underway on the Cozumel thrasher in a project funded by the American Bird Conservancy and Conservation International (4). Surveys are urgently needed to determine whether this species still persists and an investigation into its ecology would provide further explanation for its decline and help identify suitable conservation actions (2) (5).

Its habitat is also threatened by human settlement land clearing for agriculture and logging. While this is a problem in many areas worldwide Sulawesi is particularly sensitive as it is an island and therefore has a limited amount of land for its wildlife and expanding human population (4).,International trade in this species is prohibited by its listing on Appendix II of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) (3). Hunting on the island however is harder to regulate. This macaque is found in three areas on the island where hunting logging and clearing is illegal. However it is not clear how effective these regulations are (4). Captive breeding of this species has been successful at Jersey Zoo and a number of other zoos and individuals may be reintroduced into the wild in the future.

Habitat destruction continues to encroach on the marshes where this species is found and competition with introduced and <strong>hybrid</strong> species poses further threats to survival (5).,Recent reports indicated that population numbers of the Cuban crocodile are showing signs of recovery; the population in the Zapata swamp is estimated at between 3000 and 6000 individuals (6). Active measures are underway to ensure this population remains well protected but a further important conservation priority is the establishment of an alternative wild population (5).

1130,1130,Villosa trabalis,cumberland bean pearly mussel ,Animalia,Mollusca,Bivalvia,Unionoida,Unionidae,Villosa ,Length: up to 5.5 cm (2),Historically the Cumberland bean pearly mussel inhabited ten river systems but now occupies only four (3). Unfortunately like many other species of mussel the Cumberland bean pearly mussel is under threat due to human activities namely siltation channelization and water pollution such as from toxic chemical spills and run-off from urban and agricultural areas (8). Being a filter feeder the Cumberland bean pearly mussel must have exceptionally clean water to feed reproduce and respire thus any pollution or siltation seriously jeopardises the musselâ??s chance of survival as the water becomes dirty or poisonous. In addition channelization destroys suitable river habitats changing the dynamics of the water downstream so that it is no longer suitable for the mussel (2). Population numbers are hard to estimate as little data are available; however it is thought that there are around 1000 to 2000 individuals left in the wild meaning that this species has suffered a decline of around 75 to 90 percent since it was first discovered (4).,This species was first listed as Endangered by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service in June 1976 and a conservation plan was approved in August 1984. The aims of the recovery plan are to re-establish the Cumberland bean pearly mussel within two river systems that were formerly part of its range and to prevent the loss or degradation of existing habitats (4) (8). It is essential for more research to be carried out on the life history of this mysterious mussel including studies to identify the host fish species of the <strong>larvae</strong> to understand how to rear the species in a laboratory to aid with reintroduction and to identify potential habitats for reintroduction (4). ,pollution; , ,1,0.0

Fortunately owing to its listing on Appendix I of CITES all trade in this species is prohibited unless under exceptional circumstances (3). In an effort to increase the number of individuals occurring in the wild a propagation project is being developed with the cooperation of commercial farmers in the Eastern Cape province of South Africa.

The greatest threat to this speciesâ?? survival on the mainland is probably the presence of unleashed dogs in Nahuelbuta National Park which may attack the foxes and also have the potential to transmit diseases. Despite dogs being prohibited from the park they are often allowed in with visitors and subsequently let loose (1). Many foxes have become habituated to humans through unrestricted feeding by visitors and spend much of their time under vehicles in the car park where they are at risk of being killed by visitorsâ?? cars (2). The larger island population appears relatively safer with ChiloÃ© National Park encompassing most of the still untouched rainforest of the island and containing a sizeable fox population. However surrounding areas also containing foxes are suffering from ongoing logging forest fragmentation and poaching by locals (1). Some foxes have been persecuted by farmers on the island for killing their poultry and attacks from dogs also pose a threat here (2).,Darwinâ??s fox has been protected by Chilean law since 1929 but enforcement can be difficult and some poaching unfortunately continues (1). Research and monitoring of this species is ongoing being undertaken by initiatives such as Darwinâ??s Fox Research and Conservation Project which also seeks to raise awareness amongst schools dog owners farmers and loggers of the plight of the fox and the dangers that imperil it (5). The 430 square kilometre ChiloÃ© National Park protects much of the island population and the smaller 68 square kilometre Nahuelbuta National Park protects the mainland population. However a number of foxes at Nahuelbuta are known to move to lower unprotected areas during the winter in search of milder conditions where they become more vulnerable to mortality. It has therefore been recommended that the park be expanded to protect the foxes that use these areas (1). However it is also essential that Park wardens become stricter about enforcing Park rules. Dogs brought in by visitors pose a serious threat whilst continuous feeding of the foxes has habituated them to humans and thereby made them ever more vulnerable to the dangers people bring. Indeed it has been suggested that if current relaxed attitudes continue in Nahuelbuta National Park ChiloÃ© National Park may become the only long-term safe area for this rare <strong>endemic</strong> fox (2). ,fragmentation;poaching;disease; ,protected; ,3,1.0

The greatest threat to this speciesâ?? survival on the mainland is probably the presence of unleashed dogs in Nahuelbuta National Park which may attack the foxes and also have the potential to transmit diseases.

During the 1990s when Vietnam opened itself up to the international community and the Chinese economy started to boom traders and poachers moved in to utilise Vietnamâ??s biodiversity (4). Poachers killed this langur not only for meat but also for bones organs and tissues that are used in traditional medicines (8). Hunting has reduced in recent years with increasing legal protection but continues to pose a significant threat. Habitat loss is also a danger to this species with the World Conservation Monitoring Centre of the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP-WCMC) estimating that a total of 30000 hectares of forest are destroyed each year in Vietnam (4). The clearing of forests to accommodate human commercial and residential growth continues to separate the remaining populations of Delacourâ??s langur which are now at risk of becoming too small to be viably sustainable (2). Sixty percent of Delacourâ??s langurs occur in isolated populations of fewer than 20 individuals. The loss of these sub-populations and consequently 60 percent of the whole population is feared likely in the near future without management strict regulations and law enforcement (5).,Four areas where Delacourâ??s langurs are protected include: Cuc Phuong National Park Pu Luong Nature Reserve Hoa Lu Cultural and Historical Site and the recently-established Van Long Nature Reserve which is believed to contain the largest remaining population of around 70 individuals (5) (8). Unfortunately protected areas often suffer more from poaching than unprotected areas because their dense population of wildlife is seen as more profitable (2). Thus conservation groups are working to increase the level of protection and law enforcement within these protected areas. The Van Long Nature Reserve is now well guarded by rangers largely funded by the Frankfurt Zoological Society.

The biggest threats to Grauerâ??s gorillas result from armed conflict in and around the parks. In the past decade many Grauerâ??s gorillas have been shot dead in crossfire or for food by people hiding in the forest. Ongoing instability in the region means that this problem is getting worse as civil war has made arms more accessible and continues to create large numbers of refugees (7). A relatively new threat to the gorillas comes from the tourism. While tourism has so far aided its survival large numbers of people coming into close contact with gorillas may put them at risk from human diseases (7).,The mountain gorilla occurs mainly within national parks and in some areas is protected by armed guards to prevent poaching (7). Gorillas in the Virunga region have been studied and protected for many decades and are now seen as an important source of tourist revenue (8). The United Nations Environmental Programme (UNEP) has recognised the urgent need to protect our closest relatives and has established a Great Ape Survival Project (GRASP). This project is aimed at identifying the conservation initiatives required to secure the future of the apes and at obtaining political support and funding to allow these to be achieved (9).

In the past decade many Grauerâ??s gorillas have been shot dead in crossfire or for food by people hiding in the forest. Ongoing instability in the region means that this problem is getting worse as civil war has made arms more accessible and continues to create large numbers of refugees (7). A relatively new threat to the gorillas comes from the tourism. While tourism has so far aided its survival large numbers of people coming into close contact with gorillas may put them at risk from human diseases (7).,The mountain gorilla occurs mainly within national parks and in some areas is protected by armed guards to prevent poaching (7). Gorillas in the Virunga region have been studied and protected for many decades and are now seen as an important source of tourist revenue (8). The United Nations Environmental Programme (UNEP) has recognised the urgent need to protect our closest relatives and has established a Great Ape Survival Project (GRASP). This project is aimed at identifying the conservation initiatives required to secure the future of the apes and at obtaining political support and funding to allow these to be achieved (9). A multifaceted approach is needed to ensure the survival of one of our most impressive cousins. ,poaching;disease; ,protected; ,2,1.0

It has been recorded from a few protected areas (1) and is listed on Appendix II of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) which means that any international trade in this species should be carefully monitored (3). Further measures are certainly needed such as hunting regulations and field studies to identify areas in which this species occurs for which protection is critical (1).   ,loss;hunting; ,cites;protected; ,2,2.0

Vietnamâ??s lowland <strong>primary forest</strong> has now almost been completely stripped away as a result of herbicide spraying during the Vietnam War and more recently by commercial logging and clearance for agriculture (5) (6). The last remaining forests known to support this pheasant are becoming progressively degraded by wood-cutters (6) and are vulnerable to commercial logging firewood collection charcoal production and the continued clearance of land for cultivation (7). It is thought that the completion of the Ho Chi Minh National Highway which bisects the three provinces in which the species is known to occur will only serve to increase the levels of disturbance. Hunting for food poses an additional threat and this pheasant is likely to be affected by indiscriminate snaring (6).,The areas in which there are recent records for Edwardsâ??s pheasant have been incorporated into two recently established nature reserves Phong Dien and Dakrong which are likely to be the last refuges for the species (6) (9). Bach Ma National Park lies within the historical range of this species and a poster campaign to obtain local information was conducted there in 1996 and 1997 but as yet there have been no confirmed records from this park. In December 2003 the captive population numbered 1033 individuals (6). A studbook was first developed in the 1960s and abandoned in the 1970s owing to lack of resources but efforts were renewed in the 1990s (7) and an international studbook now helps coordinate breeding to ensure that the captive population stays genetically healthy (5). Although there have been problems with <strong>inbreeding</strong> and <strong>hybridisation</strong> in captivity screening is thankfully helping eliminate hybrids from much of the captive stock (6).

Agricultural expansion cultivation overgrazing and urban encroachment have put enormous pressure on the Egyptian tortoiseâ??s fragile and dwindling habitat dramatically reducing available vegetation for food and cover (1) (8). Additionally the species has suffered heavily in Egypt from collection for the national and international pet trade which moved its attention to Libyan stock after Egyptian subpopulations were harvested to extinction. Trade in this species also exists in Libya itself which is a major concern for the future of the remaining world population (1).,The Egyptian tortoise is protected by law in Egypt but not in Libya. Additionally the tortoise is listed under Appendix I of CITES prohibiting international trade in the species. However these protective laws are evidently often flouted. Protected areas exist in Egypt including the one in which the two individuals were found in 2001 but there is little benefit of this protection or indeed motivation to establish new protected areas for the species since it is effectively extinct in Egypt. This tortoise may also occur in Kouf National Park in northeast Libya where one specimen was found 20 years ago but no other reserves exist in the speciesâ?? known range. The establishment of more protected areas in Libya would be of enormous benefit to the Egyptian tortoise and greatly enhance its chances of survival.

At present around one third of the world's reef-building corals are threatened with extinction. The principal threat to corals is the rise in sea temperature associated with global climate change. This leads to coral bleaching where the symbiotic algae are expelled leaving the corals weak and vulnerable to an increasing variety of harmful diseases. Climate change is also expected cause more extreme weather incidents and to increase ocean acidification which impairs the coral's ability to form a skeleton. These global threats are compounded by localised threats from pollution destructive fishing practices invasive species and human development (6).,Staghorn corals are listed on Appendix II of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) and therefore trade in this coral should be carefully regulated and a permit is required to bring the coral or objects made from them into the countries that have signed the CITES convention (2). Staghorn corals will also form part of the marine community in many marine protected areas or in areas where management plans are in place to protect the coral community.

Even since their listing on Appendix I of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) with export of wild specimens therefore banned there have still been reports of tortoises being smuggled out illegally. In addition there are serious concerns that specimens advertised as â??captive-bredâ?? are really captured from the wild. Given that the species has a low reproductive rate and it is mostly breeding females that are collected the flat-shelled spider tortoise has little capacity to recover from sustained over-harvesting.  Floods caused by cyclones are one of the natural threats which this species has to endure (2).,The majority of the flat-shelled tortoiseâ??s range now occurs within the recently designated Menabe Antimena protected area which offers some hope that a significant proportion of its remaining habitat will be preserved (6). Other protected areas of forest occur within this speciesâ?? range such as the special Andranomena Forest Reserve and private Analabe Reserve but regulations are believed to have been rarely enforced and the precise status of the species in these areas is currently unknown (2). ,pet; ,cites;protected; ,1,2.0
1191,1191,Sternotherus depressus,flattened musk turtle ,Animalia,Chordata,Reptilia,Testudines,Kinosternidae,Sternotherus ,Carapace length: up to 12 cm (2),The flattened musk turtle is most seriously threatened by habitat degradation and fragmentation and remaining populations are further threatened by disease pollution and siltation of its habitat and over-collection from the wild for the pet trade (2) (3) (7) (8). Pollution from mining forestry agricultural and industrial chemicals and residential sewage is thought to be responsible for the high levels of shell erosion and infections recently observed in this species as well as reducing numbers of <strong>molluscs</strong> and other <strong>invertebrates</strong> on which the species feeds (2). Excessive sediment accumulation (siltation) also appears to be having a dramatic impact on this small turtle possibly through smothering <strong>molluscs</strong> and other <strong>invertebrate</strong> food sources altering the habitat where this turtle seeks food and cover and accumulating heavy metals and chemical toxins (2) (3). In the 1970s and 80s commercial collecting for the pet trade further reduced some populations with large collections having been recorded and individuals advertised in several places for over 80 U.S. dollars each (2) (3) (4). It is also hard for flattened musk turtle populations to recover from any adverse changes due to its slowness to mature and low reproductive rate (see â??Biologyâ??) (2).,A bill passed by the Alabama legislature in May 1984 prohibits the taking of this species from the wild and may be a deterrent to commercial overexploitation in the future (9). The flattened musk turtle is also protected as threatened under the US Endangered Species Act of 1973 as amended. It is therefore a nationally-recognised species of concern and is fully protected by law.

1195,1195,Mimus trifasciatus,floreana mockingbird ,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Mimidae,Mimus ,Length: 25 cm (2),With only 20 to 50 individuals left on Champion islet and an estimated 300 to 500 on Gardner (as of 2009) the Floreana mockingbird is one of the rarest and most threatened birds in the world (11). Its original extinction from Floreana was probably a combination of several factors including the introduction of black rats (<i>Rattus rattus</i>) and the loss of <i>Opuntia </i>habitat brought about by invasive herbivores (2) (3) (5). In contrast declines recorded in the two remaining satellite populations in some years are thought to be being primarily driven by an increase in the frequency of dry <strong>La NiÃ±a</strong> years which lead to high levels of adult mortality (2) (5) (12). Due to its isolation since the extinction of the main population on Floreana Island the Champion population has lost a significant amount of genetic diversity and given its precariously small size is in a severely vulnerable state (2) (11). Fortunately the population on Gardner still contains a higher number of individuals and relatively high levels of genetic diversity (11). However a single extreme weather event or newly introduced predators could easily decimate the entire surviving population. This is not to mention the ever present spectre of an avian disease spreading to the mockingbird population or the introduction of the black rat from neighbouring Floreana (2) (5) (11).,In 2008 the Charles Darwin Foundation in collaboration with several other international organisations set out an emergency management plan to preserve the imperilled Floreana mockingbird by reintroducing it to its original home on Floreana. This bold scheme is expected to be carried out in phases over a period of approximately ten years. The initial phase will involve eradicating all introduced species from Floreana and developing a program to breed mockingbirds in captivity. This will be followed by the first release trials of wild or captive bred birds and finally the supervision and monitoring of the released population (11) (12). It is hoped that the first phases of the reintroduction will be started in 2009 the bicentenary of the birth of Charles Darwin (12) (13). ,loss;invasive;disease; , ,3,0.0

Forests in the region have been extensively cleared so that little suitable habitat now remains. Furthermore it is thought that the species could be declining as a result of possible displacement by or even <strong>hybridisation</strong> with the rusty-faced parrot (<i>H. amazonina</i>). Although no major threats have been identified such a small range and population renders the species extremely vulnerable (5).,Fuertesâ??s parrot is protected in the Alto QuindÃ­o Acaime and CaÃ±on del QuindÃ­o Natural Reserves (5). Following the incredible rediscovery of this colourful parrot there has been a surge of conservation work in the region and nest boxes have been provided where few mature trees suitable for nesting remained. This initiative has been highly successful with 21 nest boxes active in 2005 and each box producing three chicks twice a year helping population numbers to slowly climb (4). , ,protected; ,0,1.0

Despite these efforts between 1997 and 2006 the wild population declined by 58 percent from 436 to just 182 breeding adults (1). Habitat loss and degradation poses the biggest threat to this speciesâ?? survival as the human population explosion of the Indian subcontinent continues to encroach on the river systems where it is found (5). Dams irrigation projects sand mining and artificial embankments have all encroached on the gharialâ??s habitat reducing its range to just two percent of what it was (1). In addition fishing removes important food sources and can cause clashes with fishermen leading to accidental or deliberate death. Eggs are collected for medicinal properties and adult males are hunted due to the belief that the snout has aphrodisiac effects (5).,Gharial population levels reached a catastrophic low in the 1970s prompting a massive rescue campaign (4). Restocking programmes involving captive breeding and ranching (wild eggs reared in captivity and then re-released) were established in India in 1975 and Nepal in 1978 and these worked to gradually bring this species back from the brink of extinction (5). However in recent years the population has suffered another devastating decline and in 2006 less than 200 breeding adults remained in the wild (1). The current decline indicates that no matter how many gharials are released into the wild habitat degradation and hunting need to be prevented to ensure the speciesâ?? survival. Consequently the focus of current conservation efforts is moving away from captive breeding programmes towards other initiatives such as the protection of gharial habitat enforcement of the speciesâ?? protected status and the education and involvement of local people in the speciesâ?? conservation.

Although at present there are no signs of reduction of population size due to this take off it must be carefully monitored in the future to assure the survivorship of the species (5). Furthermore large-scale deforestation predation by introduced species and encroachment by humans are all posing threats to the golden frog (4).,All mantella frogs are listed on Appendix II of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) which controls international trade in these species (2). The golden frog is bred in captivity in a number of zoos and other breeding facilities including the Detroit Zoological Instituteâ??s National Amphibian Conservation Centre which breeds hundreds each year for use in breeding programmes in other institutions (6). The provision of captive-bred individuals to zoos reduces the stress on wild populations caused by collection. Captive breeding programmes may also provide a genetic reservoir of a species to safeguard it should the population undergo a drastic decline or even become extinct; they also provide sources of animals for reintroduction to the wild and allow research to be carried out (6).

1220,1220,Bothropoides insularis,golden lancehead ,Animalia,Chordata,Reptilia,Squamata,Viperidae,Bothropoides ,Length: up to 110 cm (2),The golden lancehead has one of the largest population densities of any snake (4). However its overall population is relatively small between 2000 and 4000 individuals (4) (12) and is restricted to a single tiny island where its habitat is under threat from deforestation and burning (1) (4) (11). Its population is believed to have decreased in recent decades exacerbated by the removal of snakes from the island for the illegal wild animal trade (4) (11) (12) (13).,<i><em>Bothropoides</em></i> species are highly venomous and are considered to be particularly dangerous to humans as a group being responsible for about 90 percent of all serious snakebites in South America (6). However in recent years studies have shown the venom of the golden lancehead to have practical applications for humans with many potential medical uses making it even more important to protect this snake (4). ,environmental;environment; ,captive breeding; ,2,1.0

Indeed the introduced house mouse <i>Mus musculus </i>poses the greatest present threat through competition and predation (2). Buntings are found at low density in lowland areas where mice are abundant (2) and experiments with â??dummyâ?? eggs imply that mouse predation on their nests is very high (5). Thus researchers think the bird may have been forced by these mice from the best nesting sites into less suitable upland regions (5).

The main threat to this species is hunting for food and for use in traditional â??medicinesâ?? (1). It is also captured in snares for the pet trade although captive animals rarely survive long due to their highly sensitive digestive system (1) (4). At Kon Cha Rang Nature Reserve which contains one of the largest remaining grey-shanked douc populations there is a traditional hunting season in September with large numbers of snares set in trees to catch this monkey (8). The grey-shanked douc is also particularly vulnerable to hunting with guns as in response to disturbance it typically remains motionless in the canopy rather than fleeing (1). This exploitation is compounded by the loss of the grey-shanked doucâ??s forest habitat which is highly fragmented and degraded and continues to be lost to logging and agriculture at a rate of around 100 square kilometres per year (1). Many communities surrounding these forests employ shifting agricultural strategies with a tendency to convert forest farming and livestock grazing areas greatly increasing the pressure on this rare monkeyâ??s habitat (8).  ,Supporting at least 24 species of primate a quarter of which are thought to be <strong>endemic</strong> the protection of Vietnamâ??s natural habitats is of critical importance to primate conservation (4).

The main threat to this species is hunting for food and for use in traditional â??medicinesâ?? (1). It is also captured in snares for the pet trade although captive animals rarely survive long due to their highly sensitive digestive system (1) (4). At Kon Cha Rang Nature Reserve which contains one of the largest remaining grey-shanked douc populations there is a traditional hunting season in September with large numbers of snares set in trees to catch this monkey (8). The grey-shanked douc is also particularly vulnerable to hunting with guns as in response to disturbance it typically remains motionless in the canopy rather than fleeing (1). This exploitation is compounded by the loss of the grey-shanked doucâ??s forest habitat which is highly fragmented and degraded and continues to be lost to logging and agriculture at a rate of around 100 square kilometres per year (1). Many communities surrounding these forests employ shifting agricultural strategies with a tendency to convert forest farming and livestock grazing areas greatly increasing the pressure on this rare monkeyâ??s habitat (8).  ,Supporting at least 24 species of primate a quarter of which are thought to be <strong>endemic</strong> the protection of Vietnamâ??s natural habitats is of critical importance to primate conservation (4).

It is now known to out-compete the hairy marron in regions where the river habitat is degraded due to loss of vegetation or poor water flow (5). The hairy marron has suffered an 80 to 90 percent reduction in numbers due to the human-induced invasion of the smooth marron (4). Other introduced species are also thought to be contributing to the hairy marronâ??s decline (5).,The Western Australia Department of Conservation and Land Management is working together with the Department of Fisheries and the public to develop and implement a recovery plan for the hairy marron. In addition the importation of non-native crayfish species is banned in Australia to prevent the spread of the crayfish plague fungus that has been responsible for the decline of several European crayfish species (2). ,loss;pet; , ,2,0.0

Despite protection numbers of these seals continue to decline; an average decline of 3% a year occurred between 1985 and 1999 (6). A lack of food resources especially around French Frigate Shoals has been cited as the cause of high juvenile mortality and the presence of severely emaciated individuals (7). In addition entanglement in marine debris that accumulates in these islands from vast areas of the Pacific as well as disturbance further threatens this species (6). Non-human threats such as predation by sharks and the prevalence of violent â??mobbingâ?? behaviour of mature males also play a part in the decline of monk seal numbers (4).,The Hawaiian monk seal has been listed on the United States Endangered Species List since 1976 and the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) is responsible for the management of the population (7). Major colonies are surveyed annually and beach counts help to give an indication of the state of each breeding population (7); flipper tagging has been carried out since the early 1980s (6). The Northwest Hawaiian Islands lobster fishery was closed in 2000 and this may help to increase prey availability (6). In 2000 the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands Coral Reef Ecosystem Reserve was established which should help to protect the habitat of this unique seal (7). , , ,0,0.0

Major threats to survival come from illegal trade in the turtle's prized shell known as tortoiseshell which has been sought for jewellery and ornaments for centuries. There is also a substantial market for eggs meat and even stuffed juveniles as exotic gifts in some parts of the world (10). Additional pressure on the global population comes from harvests to support traditional customs the loss of nesting sites accidental entanglement in fishing lines and the deterioration of coral reef systems which act as feeding sites for these turtles (11).,International trade in the hawksbill turtle is banned amongst signatory nations by its listing on Appendix I of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) (3) but extensive illegal trafficking still occurs. Preventing this black market trade is the key to saving this species and TRAFFIC (the wildlife trade monitoring network) is involved in monitoring and highlighting this problem (14).

Habitat loss has drastically reduced the range of <em>Hemicycla saulcyi</em> and the species is now restricted to a small isolated population occupying a total area of under four square kilometres (2) (4) (5) (6). Most of La Isleta is an old military base which has so far prevented encroachment by the city of Las Palmas de Gran Canaria. However this base is being closed and the likely increase in building and development in the area could be disastrous for this species (2) (5) (7). A further potential threat may come from the spread of introduced snails which are believed to compete with the <strong>endemic</strong> snail species potentially displacing them from some areas (4). Predation by rats mice and lizards may also be a problem (3).,No species of land snail in the Canary Islands currently receives direct legal protection and therefore indirect protection through preservation of its habitat will be all the more vital to both <em>Hemicycla saulcyi</em> and other threatened <strong>endemic</strong> snails (2) (4) (7). It has been recommended that the north-western part of La Isleta be made a Special Nature Reserve in order to prevent building and development in the area. A Recovery Plan has also been recommended to promote the restoration of the natural vegetation (2) (4). With only around thirty living specimens of <em>Hemicycla saulcyi saulcyi</em> observed to date the total population may be tiny (2) (6) and without adequate protection the future for this highly endangered <strong>mollusc</strong> is uncertain. ,loss;pet; , ,2,0.0

Whilst myxomatosis is not such a threat today a new disease that arrived in Spain in 1988 known as Rabbit Haemorrhagic Disease is once again threatening rabbit numbers (1) (3) (5). Despite protection measures and heavy fines illegal hunting continues and the accidental killing of lynx in rabbit traps traps set for smaller carnivores or with poisoned fox bait together with road fatalities are some of the major causes of mortality at present (3) (5). ,"The Iberian lynx is legally protected in both <st1:country-region w:st=""on"">Spain</st1:country-region> and <st1:country-region w:st=""on""><st1:place w:st=""on"">Portugal</st1:place></st1:country-region> (1) and is also listed on Appendix I of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) meaning international trade in the species is prohibited (4).

The species has not been recorded outside of one small area of less than ten square kilometres and is believed to have declined due to a reduction in the extent and quality of its habitat as a result of touristic activities and fire. The species is also reported to be affected by extreme frosts (1). It is not known to what extent the Itatiaia highland frog may also have been impacted by factors such as climate change disease and pollution which are presenting great threats to amphibian species worldwide (7).,The range of the Itatiaia highland frog lies within the Parque Nacional do Itatiaia (1) and the species has been listed as Critically Endangered in Brazil (8). Extensive surveys are needed to determine whether this rare amphibian still survives in the wild and if it is found urgent conservation measures will be needed to save the remaining individuals including a conservation management plan and the continued conservation and preservation of its habitat (1). ,disease;pollution; , ,2,0.0

1269,1269,Campephilus principalis,ivorybilled woodpecker ,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Piciformes,Picidae,Campephilus ,Size: 48 â?? 53 cm (2),The ivory-billed woodpecker was known from the southeastern United States and Cuba. Logging mining plantations and other forms of exploitation have swept away the once extensive tracts of pristine forest that were home to this woodpecker. Logging of the mature forests that form its habitat was probably the major cause of the disappearance of this species (2). Although incredible recent discoveries have provided new hope for both the U.S. and Cuban <strong>subspecies</strong> previously considered extinct the ivory-billed woodpecker is nevertheless clinging on to an extremely precarious existence.,Searches for the elusive ivory-billed woodpecker in the mountains of southern Cuba and in the U.S. continue. If sightings are confirmed the implementation of effective protection measures will be vital for the future of this fascinating bird (2). , , ,0,0.0

In addition habitat loss resulting from logging activities and development has impacted the species and the two critically small populations are also exceptionally vulnerable to disease and natural disasters both of which could wipe out an entire population (6).,In Indonesia the Javan rhino has been legally protected since 1931 and Ujung Kulon National Park was set aside for the conservation of this species. The protected area in which the Vietnamese Javan rhinoceros occurs (previously known as the Cat Loc Nature Reserve) was for many years ineffectively protected (6) but since the Cat Loc area was integrated into the Cat Tien National Park in 1998 more forest guards have been deployed and the conservation organisation WWF has been supporting these teams with better equipment and allowances (7). ,loss;hunting;disease; ,protected;wwf; ,3,2.0

1275,1275,Rhinoptilus bitorquatus,jerdons courser ,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Charadriiformes,Glareolidae,Rhinoptilus ,Average head-body length: 27 cm (2),Jerdonâ??s courser has an extremely limited range and a very small population estimated between 50 and 240 individuals (1). The principal threat to Jerdonâ??s courser is loss and degradation of habitat.  Inhabiting scrub forest bordering villages and agricultural land it is vulnerable to the effects of livestock overgrazing firewood collecting forest clearing for agriculture bird trapping and direct human disturbance. Extensive areas of suitable habitat have also been lost through quarrying and mining (5) (6). Between 1991 and 2000 an estimated 11 to 15 percent of suitable habitat was lost while forest patches became smaller and fragmented (9). Furthermore the construction in 2005 of the Telugu-Ganga Canal resulted in the loss of Jerdonâ??s courser habitat and the destruction of one newly-discovered site for the species (6). The recent construction of the Somasilla dam resulted in the relocation of 57 villages to the Lankamalai region bordering Jerdonâ??s courser habitat. This is expected to increase the disturbances on Jerdonâ??s courser habitat as the settlers are dependant on the forests for resources such as firewood and livestock grazing (4).   ,As a direct result of the re-discovery of Jerdonâ??s courser the Lankamalleswara Wildlife Sanctuary was established with the aims of protecting the species and its habitat (6). Since 2001 the Bombay Natural History Society in collaboration with the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds and the Universities of Cambridge and Reading have been working to determine the distribution and habitat requirements of the species. The application of tracking strips camera traps and audio-playback methodologies have successfully identified new locations for Jerdonâ??s courser investigated habitat usage and evaluated threats (7) (8). Lobbying against the construction of the Telugu-Ganga canal through the Jerdonâ??s courser's range successfully avoided further habitat destruction and fragmentation in 1986 but in 2005 the canal project recommenced and resulted in the destruction of some Jerdonâ??s Courser habitat. However although canal construction proceeded the route was modified to make it less damaging and 1000 hectares of additional land were acquired by the Andhra Pradesh Forest Department in compensation (6) (10). If Jerdonâ??s courser can be restored on this degraded land the future prospects of the species can be improved (5). Further proposed measures include a radio-telemetry study to determine ecological requirements for the species and the initiation of conservation awareness programmes amongst local communities to minimise habitat loss and alteration (4). ,loss; , ,1,0.0

Repeated burning deforestation and the introduction of animals and plants and consequently disease have resulted in 75 percent of the <strong>endemic</strong> <strong>vascular flora</strong> being on the verge of extinction (7). This together with the introduction of rabbits and goats has reduced vegetation cover and increased erosion so that now more than 15 percent of the island is severely eroded and lacking vegetation (6). The introduced species that are of specific concern for the Juan FernÃ¡ndez firecrown include rats dogs pigs semi-feral cattle rabbits which have severely affected the low elevation flora including some hummingbird nectar plants; coatis and bramble. Coatis thrive throughout both lowland and upland areas and are opportunistic foragers feeding on the birds and their eggs; while bramble shades out regenerating forest (6) and bears flowers too small for the Juan FernÃ¡ndez firecrown to feed on (2). Due to these changes in habitat the green-backed firecrown (<i>Sephanoides sephanoides</i>) which can feed on brambleis increasing in number and is competing with the Juan FernÃ¡ndez firecrown for space. The Juan FernÃ¡ndez firecrown is also less able to protect itself from predation than the green-backed firecrown. In addition to these threats is the steady impact of collection by scientists and private collectors (6).,The Juan FernÃ¡ndez Islands were designated a national park in 1935 (although not actively protected until 1967) and a biosphere reserve in 1977. The Chilean government began a recovery project in 1997 to restore natural habitat and the islands have since been nominated for World Heritage listing (5). The World Conservation Union (IUCN) has recommended that the population of the Juan FernÃ¡ndez firecrown is monitored that all introduced mammals are removed introduced plant populations are controlled native flora is replanted and that grazing restrictions are enforced within the national park (5). This beautiful little bird is at great threat of extinction because of the dangerously low numbers in the single remaining population.

1280,1280,Podiceps taczanowskii,junn grebe ,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Podicipediformes,Podicipedidae,Podiceps ,Length: 33 â?? 38 cm (2),Being restricted to only one lake makes the Junin grebe extremely vulnerable to any changes in the lake. Changes to Lake Junin have resulted in the decline of the grebe from over 1000 in 1961 to probably around 200 individuals in 2007 (5) (7). In addition to this general decline population numbers also fluctuate according to the water level of the lake (7). The Upamayo Dam as part of a hydro-electric plant regulates the water level of Lake Junin creating fluctuations in the water level that can cause nearly half the lakeâ??s surface to dry up including important nesting and foraging areas for the grebes (3) (6) (8). As no young are raised when water levels are very low this regulation has a significant negative impact on the Junin grebe. However the greatest threat it faces and what will ultimately lead to its extinction if not halted is pollution of the lake from mining waste. Waste waters from surrounding mines in the area enter the lake causing water pollution and an accumulation of iron oxides in the lake sediments. The sedimentation of iron oxides causes large parts of the lake bottom to become lifeless and therefore much of the offshore area is no longer adequate feeding habitat (3) (9).,Lake Junin was designated a National Reserve in 1974 which has limited hunting and fishing in the lake but has had no affect on the primary threats of mining and dam-building activities (5). In 1999 Lake Junin was declared to be in a state of emergency resulting in the formation of a committee which implemented an environmental management plan (8). This involves further protection of the lake restrictions on the extraction of water and provisions for its cleaning (5). However much work is still required to prevent further pollution of the lake and restore the habitat. Continuing pollution will inevitably lead to the extinction of the Junin grebe unless a â??reserveâ?? population is established in another location. <strong>Translocation</strong> of the Junin grebe to a lake north of Lake Junin was attempted but unfortunately the use of gill-nets to fish trout in this lake made it unsuitable (7). In 1997 the IUCN Grebe Specialist Group created a Global Conservation Strategy to ensure the successful recovery of grebe populations and the management of wetlands (9). Particular conservation actions recommended for this species include carrying out studies of other lakes to identify suitable locations for further <strong>translocation</strong> attempts as well as taking steps to prevent pollutants from entering Lake Junin and to de-toxify lake sediments (9). ,pollution; , ,1,0.0

When Europeans began to settle in the 1800s the range of the kakapo had already dramatically declined and the situation became critical as Europeans set about clearing forests hunting and releasing mammalian predators such as domestic cats dogs stoats and rats. The kakapo is particularly vulnerable to predation by mammals due to its strong scent habit of freezing when threatened and especially its ground nesting behaviour (5) and flightlessness; the latter together with very slow breeding strategies are key elements in the demise of many endangered and extinct New Zealand species (8). Introduced possums and deer compete with the kakapo for food sources (5).,The drastic measure of removing all surviving kakapo to predator-free islands has averted extinction of this remarkable bird. There is a National Kakapo Team and a ten-year Recovery Plan for the species (5). Measures to conserve the kakapo include intensive invasive management of free-living individuals including supplementary feeding in order to stimulate and support breeding and measures to improve the survival of chicks. Although research and management are ongoing the dedication and hard work have paid off and initial results are very encouraging; the kakapo population has increased from 51 individuals in 1995 to 86 in 2002 (3). Unfortunately in July 2004 three young female kakapos died as the result of a mystery infection taking the total population down to 83 individuals. New Zealand's Department of Conservation was quick to respond giving the remaining kakapos antibiotics (9). A productive year in 2009 saw the kakapo population increase to 124 individuals (10) although the loss of a male in February 2010 brought the total down to 123 (5).

A productive year in 2009 saw the kakapo population increase to 124 individuals (10) although the loss of a male in February 2010 brought the total down to 123 (5). In January 2012 the kakapo population stood at 127 individuals (11). ,hunting;pet; , ,2,0.0

In Arizona high water discharges from the Glen Canyon Dam situated upriver from the Grand Canyon National Park results in snails being swept downstream and the loss of suitable habitat (2) while in Utah the Kanab amber snail population is at risk due to the alteration of its habitat by a private landowner (2) (3).,The Arizona Game and Fish Department and the National Park Service have attempted to establish a new wild population of Kanab amber snails in Grand Canyon National Park. In September 1998 snails were taken from Vaseyâ??s Paradise and introduced to three natural springs in areas which would not be affected by dam operations. Further individuals were <strong>translocated</strong> in July 1999 to boost population densities and improve <strong>genetic variation</strong>. Since that initial stocking in 1998 a population seems to have established at one site the Upper Elves Chasm (3). It is hoped that the successful establishment of this additional wild Kanab amber snail population in Arizona will greatly aid in the conservation of this rare species (3). ,loss; , ,1,0.0
1286,1286,Lepidochelys kempii,kemps ridley turtle ,Animalia,Chordata,Reptilia,Testudines,Cheloniidae,Lepidochelys ,27 â?? 40 kg (2),Kempâ??s ridley turtle suffered a dramatic decline during the 1950s - 60s due mainly to the over harvesting of eggs natural predation and mortality caused by trawl fisheries (6). Because nesting occurs in such large concentrations with shallow poorly disguised nests eggs are easily exploited by human collectors (by whom they are valued for their aphrodisiac properties) and by natural predators such as coyotes (5). Today the main threat to the survival of the species comes from shrimp trawlers which often operate in areas where turtles feed turtles accidentally caught in nets (<strong>by-catch</strong>) drown to death and it is estimated that between 500 to 5000 turtles are killed in this way each year (6).,International trade in Kempâ??s ridley turtles and products is banned under their listing on Appendix I of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) and the main nesting beach has been declared a National Reserve since the 1970s (5). During the breeding season nests are protected by armed patrols and subsequently very little illegal trade occurs (2). Turtle Excluding Devices (TEDs) fitted to shrimp nets can help to prevent <strong>by-catch</strong> by allowing only shrimp-sized objects to enter the net (6). There has been an international drive to introduce these devices worldwide and shrimp trawlers operating in United States waters must now be fitted with TEDs (6). These conservation efforts have led to the slow recovery of Kempâ??s ridley turtle numbers and it has been suggested that a population goal of 10000 nesting females could be reached by 2010 (2) allowing arribadas to once again adorn the Mexican coast. , ,cites;protected; ,0,2.0

The kipunji is one of the three threatened monkey species identified in the Udzungwa Mountains a testament to the biologically rich but fragile ecosystems of the region (5).,The kipunji occurs in the Kitulo National Park on Mount Rungwe which should help protect the small Livingstone Forest population there but swift action is needed to also preserve the connecting forest corridors. Although the forests of Ndundulu are in excellent condition the population is small and outside of the Udzungwa Mountains National Park in the adjacent unprotected Ndundulu Forest Reserve. This has prompted calls for the area to be better protected by expanding the boundaries of Udzungwa Mountains National Park westward to include all of the Ndundulu Forest (1).

The bones were recovered and sent to the University of Kansasâ?? Museum of Natural History but were not examined until 1982 (8).  The only significant scientific observation of the kouprey was made in 1957 when zoologist Charles Wharton studied and filmed the animal in the wild (9).

Conservation action that has taken place to date includes the eradication of the introduced grass <i>Cenchrus echinatus</i> (13) as well as the control of other alien plant species that threaten Laysanâ??s wetlands (<i>Pluchea indica</i>) on Laysan Island and the successful <strong>translocation</strong> of wild Laysan Ducks to Midway Atoll National Wildlife Refuge.  The translocated ducks have bred successfully creating an â??insuranceâ?? population which will reduce the chances of a catastrophic event wiping out the entire species since it is unlikely that a disaster would strike two islands simultaneously (15). ,disease;pet; ,cites; ,2,1.0

However intensive surveys have failed to record a single individual since 2001 (1).,The leaf-scaled sea snake used to be the most common sea snake species encountered on the <strong>reef flat</strong> at Ashmore Reef (2). However despite it being a nature reserve since 1983 (1) sightings in this particular area have not been reported since 2001 (2). Illegal fishing on the reef has been monitored at various levels since 1983 although protection of marine life in the area was not actively enforced until 1998. Unfortunately none of the implemented habitat management plans are specifically targeted towards conserving the leaf-scaled sea snake and it is unclear how or to what extent these measures are reducing the current threats to this species (1). , ,protected; ,0,1.0

This is expected to affect this species through habitat loss physiological changes and loss of prey (13). ,The leatherback turtle is protected throughout most of its range (1) and international trade in the leatherback turtle and products is banned under Appendix I of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) (3). Many conservation projects have been set up on leatherback turtle nesting beaches with specific management protocols tailored to each location. The attachment of Turtle Excluding Devices (TEDs) to shrimp nets can help prevent the accidental capture of turtles (<strong>bycatch</strong>) and the US government has recently set up Leatherback Conservation Areas in the north Pacific that are off-limits to long-line fisheries during certain times of the year (12).  ,loss; ,cites;protected; ,1,2.0

Currently the greatest threat appears to be the loss of its habitat. As human populations in the region rise largely due to the immigration of people from nearby areas hit by drought or tribal conflict more land is converted to permanent agriculture (4) destroying the grassland required by the lark. Between 1973 and 2002 suitable grassland habitat in the area declined by about 30 percent and in recent years more has been lost to the rapid encroachment of shrubs (4). Excessive grazing pressure and the suppression of natural seasonal fires has created favourable conditions for the encroaching shrubs (4).

In 2000 the population in the Amani Nature Reserve in the East Usambaras was estimated at just 150 to 200 (4) although more recent work suggests this may be a slight underestimate (7). The population in Nilo Nature Reserve East Usambara Mountains which was initially discovered in 1996 (9) is currently being investigated and preliminary data suggest that the entire East Usambara population will be higher than previously thought (12). The population of the Njesi Plateau in Mozambique is unknown but is likely to be small (2) (3) (6). ,A number of conservation efforts are underway in the East Usambaras where the long-billed tailorbird currently occurs in at least two protected areas the Amani Nature Reserve and the Nilo Nature Reserve (2) (3) (9) (11). Projects are underway to increase the amount of forest in protected areas and the Amani Nature Reserve in particular has an active conservation programme (3) (5). Additional conservation actions for the species include a population monitoring programme extensive field surveys educational programmes and the recording and monitoring of every known tailorbird <strong>territory</strong> (3).

At that time chinchilla populations were flourishing but their pelts were the most valuable in the world reaching up to $100000 for one alone and soon they faced extinction in the wild (5). There are currently an estimated 10000 individuals left in the Chilean mountains (6) (7). More recently populations have also suffered due to habitat destruction by the burning and harvesting of the algarobilla shrub at lower altitudes (7).,Chinchilla are protected by law in their natural habitat but it is extremely hard to monitor hunting in the remote mountain ranges of the Andes and illegal hunting does continue in some areas (6) (7). For the same reason it is also difficult to monitor the population. Recent estimates suggest this species is becoming more isolated following habitat loss and therefore less likely to be able to recover without human intervention. Reintroductions have not worked in the past though breeding is still successful in captivity and hundreds of chinchilla are bred commercially for the pet trade (2).

It is also caught and exported illegally from Madagascar to Asia for the traditional medicine market. Furthermore land development on Madagascar is a serious threat to this turtle as it destroys its natural habitats. Clearing forests for agriculture and timber opens up Madagascarâ??s untouched habitat and leads to terrible erosion. Subsequent siltation of rivers and lakes renders the turtles even more susceptible to trapping (5).,The Madagascar big-headed turtle is protected from international trade by its listing on Appendix II of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) (3). In May 2003 the Turtle Conservation Fund (TCF) released the first ever list of the worldâ??s top 25 endangered turtles which included the Madagascar big-headed turtle (5). The TCF intends to cover a five year â??Global Action Planâ?? that includes captive breeding and reintroduction projects trade monitoring and establishment of rescue centres local conservation plans and educational programs (5).

The exact cause of this speciesâ?? decline is unclear but natural factors such as the <strong>El NiÃ±o</strong> cycle introduced species and human activities may all be involved (2). As a result of introduced predators such as black rats cats and the smooth-billed ani preying on eggs and chicks and high levels of nest infestation by the blood sucking parasite <i>Philornis downsi</i> causing the death of nestlings the mangrove finchâ??s breeding success is low (2). Concerted conservation action is necessary if this species is to be saved from extinction.,For over a decade the Charles Darwin Foundation (CDF) has been working to conserve the mangrove finch (2). At present extensive research is being conducted to better understand this speciesâ?? breeding biology and to determine the causes of its decline (2) (5). In the meantime active protection of the remaining breeding populations is being employed through predator and nest parasite control (5).

1331,1331,Corvus kubaryi,mariana crow ,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Corvidae,Corvus ,Length: 38 cm (2),The principal cause of the Mariana crowâ??s decline on Guam has been predation by the introduced brown tree snake <i>Boiga irregularis</i>. Despite protection of nest sites this has resulted in the near complete extirpation of the species with the exception of a small number of introduced specimens (2). On Rota this species has been seriously affected by a number of threats including: forest clearance for homestead and agricultural development; direct persecution; nest predation by introduced rats and monitor lizards; competition with the introduced bird species <i>Dicrurus macrocercus</i>; and disease (2). In addition recent typhoons have destroyed large areas of forest habitat on Rota and records indicate that brown tree snake individuals have been introduced to the island (1). If the snake establishes a population it is likely to have a catastrophic effect on the Mariana crowâ??s dwindling population potentially driving it to extinction (1) (2).,The Mariana crow is listed by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service as an endangered species and several conservation measures are in place to preserve its imperilled island populations (2) (5). At present one of the main priorities for the preservation of the Mariana crow is to research and reduce the threat posed by the brown treesnake on both islands including the prevention of further spread to Rota (5). In 1993 a National Wildlife Refuge was established on Guam to preserve the remaining forest and a 40 hectare snake-free area has been created for the introduction of Mariana crows. On Rota a predation control experiment is to be initiated and there are plans to extend the coverage of the islandâ??s protected areas under the Habitat Conservation Plan for Rota's Agricultural Homesteads (1) (2). In addition to the implementation of measures to reduce the brown treesnake population and to protect remaining habitat it is essential that further research is carried out to assess the population status of the Mariana crow on Rota. This includes detailed research into the relative importance of different factors affecting the speciesâ?? survival and reproduction (5). ,disease;pet; ,protected; ,2,1.0

Although it occupies all suitable areas it has a low population density with the total population currently numbering just 500 individuals (4). The population density is thought to be constrained by food availability which has been reduced as a result of the habitat damage caused by feral pigs. Habitat degradation elsewhere appears to exacerbate the effects of heavy rainfall which may have an effect on nest failure (7).,The Hawaiian Division of Forestry and Wildlife implemented a five year recovery plan for the Maui parrotbill in 2003 which aims to protect existing habitat continue research into the ecology of the species and the threats it faces restore potential habitat and run a captive breeding programme for release of Maui parrotbills into this newly restored habitat (7). ,disease; ,captive breeding; ,1,1.0

The species has a very small range and its habitat is continuing to decline in extent and quality compounding the major threat of nest predation. As a result the Mauritius olive white-eye population has declined drastically since the mid-1970s from around 350 pairs to only 100 or so in 2001 (2) (3) (6). In addition the extremely low reproductive success recorded in recent years is of critical concern (7). With such a small population the species is also particularly vulnerable to extinction from extreme events such as cyclones.,The Mauritius olive white-eye is protected by law and part of its range occurs within the Black River National Park. There are also plans to purchase habitat around Bassin Blanc (2). In 2005 a species recovery programme was initiated by the Mauritian Wildlife Foundation with the aim of increasing knowledge of the Mauritius olive white-eye and its threats and to investigate management techniques. Since then an intensive management plan has been applied to the species involving monitoring of the wild population undertaking predator control at nest sites rescue and harvest of wild nests artificial incubation and hand-rearing of offspring.

1338,1338,Cuora mccordi,mccords box turtle ,Animalia,Chordata,Reptilia,Testudines,Bataguridae,Cuora ,Maximum carapace length: 13.4 â?? 16.5 cm (2),Like many of Asiaâ??s turtle species Mccordâ??s box turtles are dangerously close to extinction because they are being over exploited by the Asian turtle trade for meat and traditional medicine (4). In addition the turtle has suffered from capture for the western pet market and from habitat loss and degradation. The species has become increasingly scarce within the Chinese food markets indicating that populations in the wild are declining. Furthermore the extremely high prices paid in the western pet market by turtle enthusiasts with individuals reaching up to US$ 2000 signifies the rarity and difficulty of obtaining these animals (2). It has been estimated that perhaps no more than 350 specimens remain possibly considerably fewer all within private or zoo collections (6). Although no direct studies have been made it is assumed that this speciesâ?? habitat must have been drastically affected by the large-scale deforestation experienced within southwest China. Additionally pollution is a major problem in the areaâ??s waterways. Indeed the China Environment Report ranks China as the highest producer of sulphur dioxide in the world with Guangxi and Guangdong belonging to the areas most affected by acid rain (2).,As a native Chinese species Mccordâ??s box turtle is protected by the Wildlife Protection Law of 1988 which requires that capture transport and trade in wild animals is by official permit only. Chinaâ??s National Environmental Protection Agency (1998) has recommended that the species be listed as â??major protected wildlifeâ?? in order to prohibit capture and trade completely. This would help the survival of this critically endangered turtle but only if such laws could viably be enforced something that is notoriously difficult. Over 51 nature reserves and two â??scenic areasâ?? have been established in Guangxi where Mccordâ??s box turtle may occur but quantitative surveys of the speciesâ?? population size and distribution are needed to better determine the benefits of these protected areas for the species (2). The current outlook for Mccordâ??s box turtle in the wild is pretty grim but the speciesâ?? prospects for continuing survival are nevertheless hopeful largely due to its ability to adapt well to captivity and successfully reproduce (6). However there have been no plans for releasing captive-bred individuals into the wild and until the current climate of the Asian turtle trade western pet market and ongoing habitat destruction change it would seem unsafe to do so. Until such time captive-bred individuals can serve to buffer against total extinction but nevertheless remain a poor substitute for a self-sustainable population in the wild where this turtle belongs. ,loss;environment;pet;pollution; ,protection law;protected; ,4,2.0

The main threats facing this species are deliberate killing by fishermen who perceive the species as a competitor for fish entanglement in fishing gear disturbance and habitat loss through development and tourism disease and the effects of toxic algal blooms (2). In 1997 two thirds of the seals in the largest population located at Cap Blanc Mauritania were lost due to the accumulation of toxins in fish following an algal bloom (5) (10). These shy creatures have taken to hauling out in caves to give birth rather than on developed beaches and the collapse of such caves is a further threat to the survival of the species (2).,The IUCN Species Survival Commission Seal Specialist Group has devised an Action Plan for the conservation of the species the aims of which include the involvement of local fishermen research into the status of the species and the development of a captive breeding programme (7). A Greek National Programme for the Protection of the Monk Seal has been established aiming to prevent human-induced mortalities of the species and to restore and maintain a viable self-supporting population (6). Some experts believe that the removal of pups from a population to supply a captive programme could severely affect breeding within the wild population and injure the pups concerned (7). Captive breeding is usually recommended for mammal species of such low numbers as this and with threats continuing in the wild but concerns that removing young seals from the wild will not severely affect breeding in the wild and will not injure or negatively affect survival of the captured young must be adequately addressed (11).

Not only does this logging result in a reduced area for the macaques to live but it also destabilises the local ecosystem causing water levels in the forest rivers to fluctuate much more extensively than in the past. The alternating flooding and very low water levels has also caused an increase in malarial mosquitoes (7).,The Mentawai Islands are of high conservation significance as they are home to an unusually high number of <strong>endemic</strong> species and <strong>subspecies</strong> (8) and are part of the Sundaland Biodiversity Hotspot (7).

Underplanting is one of the main problems affecting the remaining forest a process in which food-producing plants such as bananas are planted within forests where they alter the natural vegetation composition and eventually cause the degradation of the forest habitat.

However volcanic eruptions between 1995 and 1997 destroyed around two-thirds of its habitat all but removing this species from the SoufriÃ¨re and South SoufriÃ¨re hills and largely restricting it to just the Centre Hills. Initial surveys suggested that much of the population had survived the eruptions with healthy numbers remaining in the Centre Hills and a smaller relict population in the South SoufriÃ¨re hills. But between 1997 and 2003 the population declined very rapidly (2) (3). The exact cause of this decline is unknown but potential agents include ash fall on the forest causing insect availability to decrease or chronic ill health of birds (2). ,Since the devastating volcanic eruption that almost caused the extinction of this striking species the Montserrat oriole has been the target of much research and management. In June 1999 eight birds were taken to Jersey Zoo to enable the development of husbandry techniques.

On Dominica this Critically Endangered frog is favoured for its meaty legs which are cooked in traditional West Indian dishes and which are in fact the countryâ??s national dish (6). Annual harvests were thought to be taking between 8000 and 36000 animals before a ban on hunting was introduced and as a result of this exploitation the population on the island is thought to be near extinction (1).,Hunting of the mountain chicken was banned on Dominica in the late 1990s although a three month open season was declared at the end of 2001 and hunting was not fully prohibited until 2003 (1) (3). Public awareness programmes have also been implemented to inform the Dominican public of the threats the mountain chicken faces and to try to discourage hunting (1).   ,loss;hunting;disease; ,captive breeding; ,3,1.0

The wood is considered enormously valuable being very fragrant and resistant to termites borers and fungal disease. It is used locally for making carvings boxes and furniture sold to tourists and is also sold abroad for light construction and flooring. The timber is thought to be particularly good for boat-building to the point that fishery officials have urged that remaining supplies be reserved for the Lake Malawi fishing industry. The Forestry Department of Malawi have recently agreed to supply Mulanje Cedar to build 450 boats for this purpose (11). The treeâ??s decline has been somewhat stemmed by a ban on felling allowing exploitation only of dead trees but illegal felling and killing of trees continues at an alarming rate. The Mulanje Mountain Forest Reserve is also generally threatened by encroachment and large-scale development such as the continual threat of bauxite mining. Additionally there is concern that mature individuals appear to be dying at a high rate thought possibly to be due to their high sensitivity to forest fires and susceptibility to attacks by a species of aphid (3). Regeneration on the other hand seems to depend on fire and is extremely poor. In addition <i>Pinus patula</i> (originally a commercial plantation species) has invaded a number of areas suitable for <i>Widdringtonia</i> colonisation (5) (9). All these threats have greatly impacted the Mulanje cedar; a 2007 study found that the remaining Mulanje cedar forests had been reduced by 40 percent over the previous 15 years (3). Out of the remaining 845.3 hectares of forest identified over 32 percent of standing Mulanje cedar was found to be dead (3). As so much dead wood is available for utilisation there should be no reason to cut live Mulanje cedar (3).,All Mulanje cedars are protected within the Mulanje Mountain Forest Reserve and licences are available now only for the exploitation of dead trees from the Forestry Department of Malawi (3) (9).

1360,1360,Biswamoyopterus biswasi,namdapha flying squirrel ,Animalia,Chordata,Mammalia,Rodentia,Sciuridae,Biswamoyopterus ,Head-body length: 405 mm (2),This little-known flying squirrel has a very restricted range and is currently known from only one location (1). Like other restricted-range species this makes it particularly vulnerable to any threats which could rapidly affect all individuals in the population. The Namdapha flying squirrel is presently threatened by habitat loss and degradation (1) caused by clear-felling for human settlements shifting agriculture and the extraction of non-timber forest products particularly the leaves of a rattan palm <i>Zalacca secunda</i> for use as a roofing material (5).,The Namdapha flying squirrel occurs within Namdapha National Park in Arunachal Pradesh (4). Despite the protection of this large area it is still affected by human activities such as those mentioned above. The Namdapha National Park contains not only the Critically Endangered Namdapha flying squirrel but is also home to populations of other threatened species including tigers (<i>Panthera tigris</i>) snow leopards (<i>Uncia unicia</i>) and Asian elephants (<i>Elephas maximus</i>). The effective protection of the Namdapha National Park is therefore incredibly important but this is also an incredibly difficult aim to achieve. This is not only due to the parkâ??s inaccessibility the lack of legal enforcement and shortage of well-trained and equipped personnel but also due to the local peopleâ??s dependence on the forest and the materials it provides. This means that any conservation measures require local peopleâ??s participation to be successful (5). ,loss; , ,1,0.0

Its existence is also threatened by rapid afforestation with <i>Eucalyptus</i> and <i>Pinus</i> species for logging operations as well as pesticide pollution from drainage and run-off into marshes (2). Continuous over-grazing by livestock and the conversion of suitable habitat into agricultural land add to the need for protected areas to ensure the survival of this species (4).,Naroskyâ??s seedeater has been reported in two national parks in Argentina and a biosphere reserve in Uruguay. However law enforcement is weak and this does not guarantee the persistence of the species in these areas. Proposals to prevent the extinction of Naroskyâ??s seedeater include surveying south Paraguay for breeding populations monitoring known populations developing an action plan removing the incentives for afforestation of grasslands protection of breeding grounds and prohibiting the trapping and keeping of this bird in captivity (2). ,pet;pollution; , ,2,0.0

In 1988 only four percent of forest cover remained on Negros and Panay held on to just eight percent of its forest.  This alarming loss is due to the clearance of forest for agriculture timber and charcoal-burning and these activities remain a serious threat to the remaining fragments of forest.  The effect of this devastating habitat destruction is aggravated by local trapping and hunting of the Negros bleeding-heart for food and presumably for the cage-bird trade (1).  As a result of these threats the extremely small population of Negros bleeding-hearts (estimated to be between 50 and 249 individuals) is still declining (4) which makes it extremely vulnerable to extinction.,Despite the precarious status of the Negros bleeding-heart there are very few specific conservation measures in place.  It occurs within the Mount Canlaon Natural Park on Negros and possibly also in the North Negros Forest Reserve.  However the North Negros Forest Reserve receives virtually no protection at present (7).  On Panay it occurs in the North West Panay Peninsula which was proclaimed a Protected Area in 2001.  Forest Rangers of the Philippine Endemic Species Conservation Project (PESCP) patrol this area and the northern part of the Central Panay Mountain Range destroying snares and curbing illegal logging.

1364,1364,Himantopus novaezelandiae,new zealand black stilt ,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Charadriiformes,Recurvirostridae,Himantopus ,220 g (2),The massive decline and retraction in range of the black stilt is mainly attributed to the introduction of mammalian predators to New Zealand such as cats ferrets and stoats (6). In the Mackenzie Basin ongoing large-scale rabbit control programmes since the 1940s may have forced feral cats to switch to hunting native birds instead (3). Habitat modification has also contributed to the decline of this species (1); a massive hydroelectric scheme in the basin has considerably altered the natural habitat (7). Today mammalian predators still represent the major threat to the continued survival of this species along with <strong>hybridisation</strong> with the closely related Australasian pied stilt which successfully colonised New Zealand subsequent to European settlement in the 1800's (6). Since the 1970's the small remnant breeding population of black stilts has been restricted in range to the Mackenzie Basin where it has been intensively protected and managed (5). If numbers continue to fall <strong>hybridisation</strong> will become an even bigger problem as individuals find it harder to find mates within their own species.,Since the mid-1900's pure black stilts have numbered fewer than 100 individuals; in 1999 numbers fell as low as 40 only 9 of which were females (6). Since the 1970's intensive predator control protection and manipulation of wild nests and captive breeding and release programmes have been the only factors preventing this species from becoming extinct in the wild (5). The New Zealand Department of Conservation set out a new KakÃ¯ Recovery Plan in 2001 (3) in a concerted effort to save this species. Phase one of the plan aims to increase numbers in the wild through captive rearing and release programmes along with predator control measures (3). The second phase of the Recovery Plan aims to identify the causes of breeding failure in the wild (3). Recent improvements in release techniques have increased the initial survival of released birds to as much as 80 to 100 percent and these are encouraging results (6) although factors that inhibit recovery remain. ,hunting; ,captive breeding; ,1,1.0

Human impact through habitat destruction and the use of harmful insecticides (such as <strong>DDT</strong>) combined with natural factors such as volcanic activity and widespread fires are thought to be partially responsible (4) (5) (6) (9). However the largest impact on the nightingale reed-warbler has been from the introduction of the brown tree snake (<em>Boiga irregularis</em>) believed to be responsible for the warblerâ??s final extirpation from Guam in 1969 (2) (4).,A great deal of conservation work has been and continues to be undertaken to ensure the survival of this Critically Endangered bird. Currently it is protected by the U.S. Endangered Species Act making it illegal to hunt kill or possess a nightingale reed-warbler or its eggs. Furthermore the wetland habitats where a great number of populations live are protected under the U.S. Clean Water Act and in 1998 a recovery plan for the species was produced by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (4) (11). ,loss; ,protected;endangered species act; ,1,2.0

The recent precipitous decline however is almost undoubtedly linked to hunting and persecution disturbance at the breeding sites and the loss of suitable habitat such as <strong>steppe</strong> and unintensive arable land and flooding of foraging areas due to construction of dams and drainage of wetlands (5) (8). Pesticide poisoning has also had disastrous consequences most notably in Turkey in the late 1950s when hundreds were killed outright by DDT (sprayed to kill mosquitoes) with the survivors subsequently suffering very low breeding success (8) (9). In May 1996 40 of the Moroccan birds died in just nine days due to an epidemic of unknown cause demonstrating how vulnerable the small remnant populations are (8).,BirdLife International and the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds (RSPB) have been working alongside local people to research and monitor this enigmatic species. A major step has been to train and manage a team of wardens in Morocco to monitor breeding and roosting sites prevent disturbance by tourists or fishermen collect information and make local people aware of the birdâ??s significance; these conservation measures have resulted in a recent slight population increase (1) (7).

Habitat alteration and incidental poisoning may also have contributed to the decline (2). The species may now be vulnerable to predation by dingoes and competition with native species for food (5).,Huge efforts have been made to conserve this species (6).

1377,1377,Neophema chrysogaster,orangebellied parrot ,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Psittachiformes,Psittacidae,Neophema ,45 - 50 g (2),This previously abundant species has suffered a precipitous decline in numbers since the 1920s primarily due to habitat loss at the overwintering grounds caused by both urban development and farming practices (5) (6). Competition with introduced species for both food and nest sites together with predation by red foxes and feral cats have further depleted populations of orange-bellied parrots (6).,An Orange-Bellied Parrot Action Plan has been running since 1980 aiming to improve the conservation status of this species so that it is no longer classified as Critically Endangered (2). Populations are regularly monitored and areas of habitat particularly in the winter grounds are protected as reserves (2). The control of predators occurs in some areas and in the moorland habitat of Tasmania controlled burning is used to increase food productivity (2). A captive breeding programme has also been set up to augment wild population numbers and by 1999 72 birds had been released into the wild with some successfully completing the return migration (2). To date the success of the Action Plan has been mixed; some intensively managed populations are showing encouraging increases in numbers whilst others continue to fall (6). There are still fewer than 200 individuals (6) in the wild and intensive conservation work will be vital for the future of this colourful bird. ,loss;pet; ,captive breeding;protected; ,2,2.0

Crocodiles could be found in large numbers around small water areas during the dry season which made them easy targets for hunters (2). Today there are an estimated 250 to 1500 individuals left in the wild (2). Illegal hunting for meat and for teeth (which are thought to have medicinal properties) along with the collection of eggs and juveniles remains the major threat to this species (2). Further threats are posed from continued habitat destruction killing by local people and from competition with the spectacle caiman (<i>Caiman crocodilus</i>) which is found in the same area (2).,Orinoco crocodiles are one of the most highly endangered of all <strong>crocodilians</strong> due to the small size and highly fragmented nature of their population (2). International trade in this species is banned under Appendix I of the Convention of International Trade in Endangered Species (CTIES) (3) and it is protected throughout much of its range (4). These protection measures however are largely ineffective and unforced and illegal poaching remains the principal threat to this species (2). In Colombia very little is known about the current status of the species and this remains a high priority for any conservation action plan (4). In Venezuela a reintroduction/ restocking plan has been developed and captive breeding is carried out at a number of sites (4).  Effective monitoring of released crocodiles is required and protection measures need to be properly enforced in order to help this species recover from such crippling over-exploitation in the past (4). ,hunting;pet; ,captive breeding;protected; ,2,2.0

Like many other reptile species around the world the principal threat to its survival is the uncontrolled collection of wild specimens for the pet trade (1). The poaching of rare species is alarmingly widespread in the mountains of the Caucasus with the illegal wildlife trade being one of the main conservation concerns in the region (10).,Owing to its precarious status in the wild Orlov's viper is in dire need of a raft of immediate conservation measures. The main priorities include the establishment of reserves where this Critically Endangered snake will be protected from poaching; the development of conservation legislation particularly concerning the regulation of trade; the implementation of education programmes for local people; and further research into the species' natural history distribution and population dynamics (1). ,poaching;pet; ,protected; ,2,1.0
1382,1382,Batagur borneoensis,painted terrapin ,Animalia,Chordata,Reptilia,Testudines,Emydidae,Callagur ,1.7 kg (2),This species is now rare throughout much of its former range with only one or two rivers home to more than 100 nesting females (2). Painted terrapins are massively exploited for their eggs which are sold for human consumption in many parts of Asia (5). Terrapin eggs are worth five times as much as chicken eggs and this species is particularly vulnerable to over-exploitation due to its low egg productivity (2). Habitat destruction is another major source of species decline; sand mining beach protection and beachfront development all disrupt the breeding habits of the terrapins (2).,International trade in painted terrapins is banned by its listing on Appendix I of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) (1) and protective legislation is also in place in most of Peninsular Malaysia (2). Egg harvesting may only be carried out by licensed collectors who then sell 70 percent of their haul to the Malaysian Fisheries Department to be incubated thus ensuring the sustainable management of this species (2). Prices offered by the Fisheries Department are however not competitive with those obtained on the black market and in the majority of cases only a very small percentage of turtle eggs are recovered (2). The enforcement of these schemes is a priority for future conservation action plans along with the protection of areas where significant populations are known to exist. A decline in the demand for terrapin eggs is the key to saving this species from extinction but would require a cultural change amongst local communities. , ,cites; ,0,1.0

As an important commercial species the high quality wood of the Parana pine was exploited for the timber trade and its highly nutritious fruits were sold for human consumption (1) (4). However the Parana pine now occupies a patchy distribution across a limited range and consequently is one of Brazilâ??s rarest trees (5). Amongst the remaining population there is a significant lack of fruiting trees which has severely limited the speciesâ?? reproductive ability (4) (5). This has been further compounded by the annual exploitation of 3400 tons of its fruits and seeds. Attempts have been made to reintroduce the species into parts of its historical range but this has been prevented by the spread of competitive <em>Pinus</em> and <em>Eucalyptus</em> species and agricultural encroachment (1).    ,The survival of the Parana pine is now dependant upon the implementation of major conservation measures. The Brazilian government introduced a ban on the sale of this species in 2001 preventing further logging and several protected areas have been created with the objective of protecting remaining populations including the Campos do Jordao State Park the Irati National Park and the Cacador National Park (1) (2).

As an important commercial species the high quality wood of the Parana pine was exploited for the timber trade and its highly nutritious fruits were sold for human consumption (1) (4). However the Parana pine now occupies a patchy distribution across a limited range and consequently is one of Brazilâ??s rarest trees (5). Amongst the remaining population there is a significant lack of fruiting trees which has severely limited the speciesâ?? reproductive ability (4) (5). This has been further compounded by the annual exploitation of 3400 tons of its fruits and seeds. Attempts have been made to reintroduce the species into parts of its historical range but this has been prevented by the spread of competitive <em>Pinus</em> and <em>Eucalyptus</em> species and agricultural encroachment (1).    ,The survival of the Parana pine is now dependant upon the implementation of major conservation measures. The Brazilian government introduced a ban on the sale of this species in 2001 preventing further logging and several protected areas have been created with the objective of protecting remaining populations including the Campos do Jordao State Park the Irati National Park and the Cacador National Park (1) (2). Plans have also been developed to maintain the speciesâ?? genetic diversity and the number of fruiting trees through seed collection improved forestry management practices and the development of locally coordinated agro-forestry schemes (4) (5).  ,pet; ,protected; ,1,1.0

A combination of trapping for the <strong>aviculture</strong> trade and widespread deforestation has pushed the Philippine cockatoo towards the edge of extinction and it is now absent from 98 percent of its former range (2) (7).  A 1994 study showed this bird to be present on just eight of the Philippine islands (6).  Its remote forest habitat and agile flight are no deterrents for trappers who know the exact location of many of its nest holes and roosting sites and frequently raid them (7) (8).

Today habitat destruction is the most pressing threat to species survival with rainforests being cleared throughout the region to make way for rice fields in an effort to cope with the human population explosion (2). Locals in this area are also in contact with the infamous esturine or 'saltwater' crocodile (<i>Crocodylus porosus</i>) which is one of the largest reptiles in the world and has a reputation as a man-eater. This factor undoubtedly contributes to local intolerance of any crocodile species even the small Philippine crocodile which is often killed when encountered (5). The very word for 'crocodile' in the Filipino language is a vile insult (7).,Next to the Chinese alligator (<i>Alligator sinensis</i>) the Philippine crocodile is considered to be the most endangered crocodilian in the world. Some authorities believe there may be less than 100 individuals left in the wild (3) although some wild habitat still remains. Urgent research is needed to assess the current status in order to implement an effective management strategy for this remaining wild population (3). This species is protected from international trade by its listing on Appendix I of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) but there is only one officially protected area within the Philippines and this is poorly enforced (3). At present captive breeding takes place in a small programme run by the Silliman University and at the government-run Crocodile Farming Institute which breeds crocodiles for commercial and conservation reasons (3).

The remaining forest is patchy and continues to be destroyed as exotic plantations are planted around and right up to the edges of the indigenous forest the harvesting of which is greatly disruptive to the forest (1). Timber plantations are also associated with a high level of invasion by alien plants. The construction of a national road through Ngele Forest has fragmented habitat and potentially populations of the pink velvet worm.,Although a permit is required to collect any animals from the province and some degree of habitat protection has been given by the State access to the area where this species occurs remains relatively uncontrolled (1). Future conservation measures advocated include a publicity campaign to raise awareness of the species and further research on population numbers range and biology of the species (1). Fortunately five specimens are currently thriving in captivity in Hamburg providing the opportunity to study their life cycle reproduction and feeding behaviour (6). Although this captive population safeguards the survival of the species for the time being more needs to be done to protect the pink velvet wormâ??s diminishing restricted habitat if this ancient unusual and elusive species has any chance of surviving in the wild. , , ,0,0.0

The initial and primary cause of decline was the widespread forest clearance that accompanied European settlement during the 18th and 19th Centuries (2). The bird has also suffered badly from persecution as a crop pest and hunting for food and the pet trade so that by the 1930s this previously abundant species had dramatically reduced to around 2000 individuals confined to a small range in the Luquillo Mountains (3) (6). The species then endured an ongoing decline until 1975 after which intensive conservation efforts helped it to gradually recover although efforts were hindered by the impact of Hurricane Hugo in September 1989 which reduced the population of 47 birds to 22 (2) (3). Despite recent population increases the parrot is considered Critically Endangered because its numbers still remain dangerously small (7). Currently the principle threats are competition for nest-sites loss of young to parasitic botflies (<i>Philornis pici</i>) predation by the pearly-eyed thrasher (<i>Margarops</i> <i>fuscatus</i>) and the red-tailed hawk (<i>Buteo</i> <i>jamaicensis</i>) and natural disasters such as hurricanes (7) (8). The extremely small size of the remaining population deems all threats incredibly serious (8).,In 1968 concentrated conservation efforts were begun to try to mitigate all these threats involving experiments with artificial nest-sites control of nest predators and competitors and captive breeding and <strong>re-introduction</strong> (7). The Puerto Rican Parrot RecoveryÂ Programme was begunÂ between the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) the U.S.D.A. Forest Service and the Puerto Rico Department of Natural and Environmental Resources (DNER) (9). Captive breeding was initiated in 1973 with the creation of the Luquillo Aviary within the Caribbean National Forest (4). In 1993 this captive flock was split and a portion moved to a second aviary in Rio Abajo at the opposite end of the island in order to prevent the potential catastrophic loss of the entire captive flock due to hurricanes or disease (4) (5) (8). The captive breeding programme has experienced great success with 190 birds now living in the two breeding aviaries (4). Since May 2000 captive reared parrots have been being released into the wild to bolster the wild population with over 40 birds released to date (4). All remaining habitat is protected in the Caribbean National Forest (7) but it is nevertheless possible that a single powerful hurricane could destroy the entire wild population in their restricted range of a single mountainous valley (4). Thus exciting plans have been made by Dr. White for a huge release in 2006 into a second more protected Karst region on the opposite end of the island (4). Should this introduction be successful this rare parrot will be given an infinitely greater chance of survival and although still critically low the speciesâ?? steadily increasing numbers provide a glimpse of hope for the future. ,loss;hunting;pet; ,captive breeding;protected; ,3,2.0

The most significant threat to the purple-winged ground-dove is habitat loss (2) (3). Its range falls within the most important agricultural land in Brazil (3) and its habitat has therefore been subject to large-scale clearance for agricultural plantations leaving the remainder highly fragmented (2). This has led to concern that the increased distances between local bamboo flowering events and the likelihood of long periods without bamboo seed production anywhere within its range will rapidly drive the purple-winged ground-dove to extinction (2).,Although the purple-winged ground-dove has been recorded in several protected areas in Brazil and in IguazÃº National Park in Argentina only small numbers have been observed and the enforcement of habitat protection in these areas is often inadequate.

Competition with a number of alien plant species such as fountain grass (<em>Pennisetum setaceum</em>) on Hawaii Island is also impacting the puâ??u waâ??awaâ??a while the beetle (<em>Physomerus grossipes</em>) poses a significant future threat on Oahu where it has recently been introduced (2).,The puâ??u waâ??awaâ??a is listed as Endangered in the United States (6) which means that it is forbidden to remove the species from the wild and that care must be taken not to disturb its fragile habitat. A number of conservation strategies have since been put in place which should hopefully help protect this species from the threats it faces. This includes fencing plants to protect them from cattle such as on the Navyâ??s Lualualei Naval Reservation where a program of alien plant removal is also ongoing (2) and the development of fire protection plans such as in Kanepuu Preserve on Lanai Island (2) which should reduce the threat puâ??u waâ??awaâ??a faces from fire. ,pet; , ,1,0.0

The only viable population of pygmy hogs is today restricted to Manas National Park and it is thought that possibly as few as 100 to 150 pygmy hogs remain (4). Even within the park boundaries there are threats from livestock grazing poaching and fire; whilst continued political unrest in the area severely hampers effective conservation efforts (2).,The pygmy hog is protected under Schedule I of the Wildlife (Protection) Act 1972 in India and international trade is banned by its listing on Appendix I of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) (2). Manas National Park was declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1986 (2). The Pygmy Hog Conservation Programme (PHCP) was established in 1995 under the aegis of a formal 'International Conservation Management and Reseach Agreement (ICMRA)' between the Pigs Peccaries and Hippo Specialist Group (8) of the IUCN the Durrell Wildlife Conservation Trust (9) and relevant local and national governmental authorities (2). The PHCP has carried out a multi-faceted strategy including field status surveys behavioural studies captive breeding personnel training and local community awareness and assistance programmes (2). The Pygmy Hog Research and Breeding Centre near Guwahati in Assam was established in 1996 and by the year 2000 the only captive population of this species had grown from the original six individuals to a total of 77 (2). In 2008 16 of these pygmy hogs were released into the Sonai Rupai Wildlife Reserve where they will be carefully monitored (10).

Although droughts and population fluctuations have been a natural occurrence throughout Raso Islandâ??s recorded history there is concern that the effects of climate change may lead to more extreme periods of drought leading to this speciesâ?? extinction (2) (3).,Not only is the Raso lark a protected species under Cape Verde law but Raso Island is classified as a National Park and requires official authorisation to visit (2) (3). Unfortunately despite these regulations poor enforcement means that unofficial visits to the island by fishermen and tourists are common (3).

Red wolves were extensively trapped and shot as they were believed to pose a direct threat to livestock and game (5). <strong>Hybridisation</strong> posed a further threat to the survival of the species as the population became increasingly fragmented; isolated individuals would crossbreed with the closely related coyote (<i>Canis latrans</i>) (10). The taxonomic status of the red wolf has been widely debated. Recent genetic and morphological research suggests that the red wolf is a unique species rather than the hybrid offspring from gray wolf (<i>Canis lupus</i>) and coyote (<i>Canis latrans</i>) <strong>interbreeding</strong> (5) (11).,Despite the ongoing debate as to the species status of the red wolf the recovery programme initiated by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service is one of the most successful large mammal conservation efforts (9). Steps to save this much-maligned species began in 1967 and culminated in the <strong>re-introduction</strong> of captive-bred individuals into the wild. Four pairs of red wolves were released in North Carolina starting in 1987 (10). A second attempt in the Great Smoky Mountains National Park in Tennessee was conducted between 1992 and 1998 but was cancelled due to the inability of wolves to establish home ranges within the park and extremely low pup survival caused by diseases from domestic dogs (4).

These reductions were believed to be due to various factors including the fall in populations of large <strong>ungulates</strong> as a result of uncontrolled hunting disease direct persecution of the birds and developments in waste disposal meaning that carcasses were more likely to be quickly disposed of in areas of human habitation (4) (6).,Although the red-headed vulture occurs in various protected areas throughout its range these are unable protect it from diclofenac treated livestock. Fortunately the manufacture of diclofenac has now been banned in India Nepal and Pakistan and its use is being phased out and replaced with a similar drug that is not toxic to vultures. However it may be some years before the use of diclofenac completely comes to an end in these countries.

The aquarium fish trade may be one of the reasons for its decline in the wild although there is not yet any evidence to support this theory. A more likely reason for the redtailed black sharkâ??s demise is habitat alteration; during the 1970s numerous dams were constructed in Thailand which probably had severe impacts on the rivers in the region. Large areas of swamps in Thailand have also been drained destroying potential habitat for the redtailed black shark (1).,Due to its popularity in the aquarium trade (tens of thousands of captive bred individuals are exported annually from Thailand) (1) the redtailed black sharkâ??s survival is probably not currently at risk. ,pollution; ,captive breeding; ,1,1.0

Around 75 percent of the regent honeyeaterâ??s habitat is thought to have been cleared for agricultural or residential purposes including substantial areas of yellow box (<em>E. melliodora</em>) and white box woodlands which are particularly important to the regent honeyeater (6). The natural regeneration of these woodlands is also limited through livestock overgrazing the removal of mature seed dispersing trees and unnatural fire regimes (3). Many remnant woodlands are now heavily degraded and highly fragmented limiting the regent honeyeaterâ??s ability to move across the landscape. Woodland fragmentation also allows populations of more aggressive honeyeaters such as the noisy miner (<em>Manorina melanocephela</em>) to expand which often out-compete the regent honeyeater for foraging and nesting opportunities (6). In the face of such severe pressure the regent honeyeater population is declining and is now estimated at an alarmingly low 1500 mature individuals (4).,The regent honeyeater is described as a flagship species for the conservation of Australiaâ??s native woodlands as efforts to save this species should help conserve many other threatened species found within its habitat. As a result the regent honeyeater has received a large degree of interest and conservation objectives are outlined in a detailed recovery plan (7). Consequently timber extraction grazing and mining have all been prohibited or minimised in a number of sites that are regularly used by the species while guidelines have also been employed to ensure proper land and forestry management and to protect suitable breeding and foraging sites (6).    ,loss;fragmentation;pet; ,protected; ,3,1.0

The majority of the land in the Karoo Desert is very unfertile but the riverine rabbit occupies the flood plains of the seasonal Karoo rivers and its tributaries which are fertile and have therefore been ploughed extensively in some areas. Removal of the natural vegetation along the rivers and streams prevents the rabbit from constructing stable breeding burrows due to the loss of the soft <strong>alluvial</strong> top soils and from feeding and escaping predation (1). Overgrazing by domestic herbivores also poses a threat to the rabbitsâ?? habitat and results in habitat degradation and fragmentation (2). As rabbits and hares are adding to the menu of farm workers they are shot or trapped with gin traps (1).,The Endangered Wildlife Trustâ??s Riverine Rabbit Working Group (EWT-RRWG) was established in August 2003 with the aim of establishing and conserving an ecosystem and socioeconomic conditions in the Karoo that can support a stable population of riverine rabbits. The EWT-RRWG achieves this through surveys research and monitoring environmental education and awareness habitat management and rehabilitation and conservation stewardship programmes. At present none of the riverine rabbit habitat is protected and the species only occurs on private Karoo farmland. Therefore the establishment of Riverine Rabbit Conservancies is an important aim for the EWT-RRWG.

In the 1800s the rate of deforestation accelerated dramatically first with the production of coffee and later with cocoa. At one stage in the early 20th century SÃ£o TomÃ© was the worldâ??s largest producer of cocoa with an estimated 42 percent of the island being devoted to its production. The crash in the price of cocoa and the islandâ??s conversion to independence in 1975 put a stop to forest clearance but not before almost all the islandâ??s lowland <strong>primary forest</strong> had been destroyed (5). The impact of this large scale loss of habitat for the SÃ£o TomÃ© fiscal is plain to see with its population estimated in 2000 to be less than 50 individuals (2). While much of the cultivated land has now reverted back to <strong>secondary forest</strong> the SÃ£o TomÃ© fiscal appears to be restricted to the tiny remaining areas of lowland <strong>primary forest</strong>. Fortunately because these areas are so remote they are not under immediate threat but with road development opening up more and more land on the island this could very easily change in the future. Furthermore there is high probability that introduced animals such as rats monkeys weasels and civets have had a negative impact on nesting birds including the SÃ£o TomÃ© fiscal (2) (5).,With patches of <strong>primary forest</strong> protected within Obo Natural Park on SÃ£o TomÃ© it is hoped that habitat suitable for the SÃ£o TomÃ© fiscal will be preserved for the future. However the benefit this species derives from this protected area is unclear as its specific ecological requirements are still so poorly understood (2) (7). It is therefore paramount that further research is carried out to develop a greater understanding of this speciesâ?? ecology as well as its population size and dynamics. This information will be invaluable in determining which areas should be prioritised for protection. Unfortunately as with many developing countries human and financial resources for conservation are limited and consequently at this stage law enforcement is non-existent. Nonetheless proposals have been made to actively manage and protect these areas as well as to list the SÃ£o TomÃ© fiscal as a protected species under national law.

The remaining population on Silhouette is unknown but is thought to be very small. The main threat to <em>Schefflera procumbens</em> is its very restricted range which makes it highly susceptible to the impacts of any threats and it may also be negatively affected by competition with invasive species poor sexual reproduction low <strong>genetic variability</strong> and limited dispersal (1).,No specific conservation measures are currently known to be in place for <em>Schefflera procumbens</em> and this species does not occur in any protected areas.

1487,1487,Terpsiphone corvina,seychelles paradiseflycatcher ,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Muscicapidae,Terpsiphone ,Length: 20 cm (2),Habitat destruction has been the major cause of the deleterious decline in paradise flycatcher numbers (2). Suitable forests on La Digue have been cleared to make way for tourist and private development (2) and for coconut plantations (3). Recently a disease affecting takamaka trees has provided further cause for concern (2).,In 1981 a small area of mature woodland habitat was designated as a reserve areas of standing water have been created and public awareness programmes put into action (2). The remnant populations on additional islands require further investigation as to whether they are viable (2). Encouragingly the population on La Digue has recently shown a marked increase and may be more adaptable than was previously feared; <strong>territories</strong> have been found in woodland near to housing developments (2). ,disease; , ,1,0.0
1488,1488,Coleura seychellensis,seychelles sheathtailed bat ,Animalia,Chordata,Mammalia,Chiroptera,Emballonuridae,Coleura ,Head-body length: 55 â?? 65 mm (2)Male weight: 10.2 g (2)Female weight: 11.1 g (2),The Seychelles sheath-tailed bat has been lost from the majority of islands where it was originally found. The precise cause of this dramatic decline is unclear; it has been speculated that introduction of the predatory barn owl (<i>Tyto alba</i>) and declines in insect availability resulting from use of pesticides may be involved (3). However the recent discovery of a second roost near marshes on Silhouette showed that the bats here feed on different insects than those eaten by roosts that forage in palm woodlands elsewhere (4). It has therefore been argued that this variability in the diet demonstrates that food is not a limiting factor for the species and the decline in the species may rather be attributable to habitat alteration caused by invasive plants obstructing roost entrances (4).,The Nature Protection Trust of the Seychelles has monitored the known population of Seychelles sheath-tailed bats since 1997 (5) (6). As with other bats the protection of roosts and foraging habitat are of great importance. Existing roosts must be preserved not only from human disturbance but also from introduced plant species that smother the cave entrances (4). To this end one roost site had the invasive Kudzu vine <i>Pueraria phaesolides</i> cut back from its entrance in 2001 and 2004 and ongoing management aims to completely remove the species from the area (4). It is hoped that removal of invasive creepers from existing and abandoned roost sites will help to increase the desperately low numbers of this critically endangered bat to more sustainable levels. ,invasive; , ,1,0.0

This species appears to be facing competition from the beech <i>Fagus sylvatica</i> which may be more adaptable to climatic changes. A reduction in deep soil following deforestation could also have played a part in the decline of the Sicilian fir (2). The small numbers of firs remaining are now at an inherent risk from any chance event and fire poses a particular danger.,The Sicilian fir has been the subject of a concerted conservation programme to protect this rare and unique local species. The remaining wild trees occur within a Regional Park; grazing and visitor numbers in the valley are carefully controlled and the trees are monitored and fenced off (3). In addition an <glos><i>ex-situ</i></glos> conservation programme has been established and has produced around 110000 trees that are available for replanting. To date replanting efforts have met with little success but scientists at the University of Palermo are investigating this speciesâ?? optimum ecological conditions in an effort to rectify this (3).

Habitat destruction and hunting are the primary threats that have brought the silky sifaka to this perilous position and continue to threaten the future survival of this species. Habitat destruction such as <strong>slash-and-burn</strong> agriculture logging and mining takes place even within so-called protected areas and (7) unfortunately with such activities often comes improved infrastructure such as roads augmenting hunting opportunities (1). Sadly unlike several sifakas no taboos against hunting this species exist and many people in Madagascar view wild lemur meat as a delicacy (7).    ,The silky sifaka is present in a few protected areas: the Anjanaharibe-Sud Special Reserve Marojejy National Park and more rarely the Anjanaharibe and Manandriana portions of the Makira Protected Area  (1) (7). Marojejy National Park forms part of the World Heritage Site â??The Rainforests of the Atsinananaâ?? for which the silky sifaka is a flagship species (7) (8). It has been recommended that other areas of forest where the silky sifaka has been recorded should be protected (1). However as mentioned above the designation of protected areas does not always provide this Critically Endangered sifaka with the absolute protection it requires. A lack of awareness and understanding amongst local people of this sifakaâ??s rarity and uniqueness is one obstacle in conservation efforts and as a result a conservation education programme took place in 2004 with encouraging results; many local people were interested in learning more about this species and showed concern for its plight (4). ,hunting; ,protected; ,1,1.0

1497,1497,Numenius tenuirostris,slenderbilled curlew ,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Charadriiformes,Scolopacidae,Numenius ,Length: 36 - 41 cm (2),The decline in the population of slender-billed curlews may have been due to the extensive hunting of waders for food in the latter half of the 19<sup>th</sup>and early 20th Century. Curlews were a prime target due to their large size and slender-billed curlews may be tamer than other species making them easy targets (8). The threat of hunting remains and the continued loss and degradation of wetlands in the Mediterranean and North Africa as well as in the breeding and staging areas is also a serious threat (7). Population estimates made in 2000 put the number of slender-billed curlew at fewer than 50 individuals (7).,The slender-billed curlew is protected in the majority of range states through which it passes and is listed on Appendix I of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) (7). It is also listed on Appendix I of the Convention on Migratory Species (CMS) under which a Slender-billed Curlew Working Group (SbCWG) has been established in the framework of a â??CMS Memorandum of Understandingâ?? for the species (5) (9).

By 2000 dead and dying <i>Gyps</i> vultures were being found so frequently in Nepal and India it was thought that they were suffering from an epidemic. The unnaturally high death toll was thought to be caused by a fatal virus but testing has revealed that the vultures were suffering from kidney failure following the consumption of cattle that had previously been treated with the anti-inflammatory drug diclofenac (2). In fact the decline is a result of a lethal level of the drug in a small proportion of the <strong>ungulate</strong> carcasses available to vultures but as vultures travel long distances to reach <strong>carrion</strong> a considerable proportion of the population has been affected (7).,It is necessary to prevent exposure of vultures to livestock carcasses that have been contaminated with diclofenac and to find an alternative replacement drug (7). Government commitment to the control of the use of the drug is crucial but until it has been entirely removed from the environment a collaboration of bird protection organisations plan to take all slender-billed vultures into captivity for the next 20 to 30 years to avoid further deaths which would further reduce the chance of a successful recovery of this already rare species (8). ,loss; , ,1,0.0
1499,1499,Pristis pectinata,smalltooth sawfish ,Animalia,Chordata,Chondrichthyes,Rajiformes,Pristidae,Pristis ,350 kg (2),The smalltooth sawfish has been over-fished both intentionally and as <strong>by-catch</strong>. Accidentally caught sawfish are rarely returned to the water alive as they are difficult to disentangle from nets and are dangerous to fishermen. Sawfish are purposefully caught for sport for food and for their oil which is used to make soap medicine and for polishing leather as well as for their saws which are removed and sold as curios. Habitat modification is also contributing to the decline of this species which is slow to recover from population crashes due to slow maturation and a long reproductive cycle (1) (2) (3).,Florida has established three wildlife refuges to protect the habitat of the smalltooth sawfish and in the hope that numbers might increase sufficiently for re-colonisation of other areas (3). It has been protected from harvesting in Florida since 1992 and over the rest of American waters since 2003 (5). Research into smalltooth sawfish life-history and population distribution as well as education and awareness initiatives may help to prevent further decline of this species but these efforts must be made worldwide to ensure the protection of this amazing fish (6). , ,protected; ,0,1.0

During the 1960s the annual catch was around 80000 tonnes worldwide (5). The flesh of this species has a particularly high fat content and is prized in Japan especially for 'sashimi' markets (5) where an individual fish can fetch as much as US$ 10000 (4). Fishing mainly takes the form of <strong>purse seine netting</strong> in Australia (6) and longline fishing in the other range states; namely New Zealand Japan the Republic of Korea Taiwan and Indonesia (5).,In 1994 Australia Japan and New Zealand signed the Convention for the Conservation of Southern Bluefin Tuna in an attempt to curb the overfishing of this species (5). The Commission for the Conservation of the Southern Bluefin Tuna (CCSBT) has subsequently formed and in 2001 was joined by the Republic of Korea (5). The objective of the Commission is to ensure the conservation and optimum utilisation of the global southern bluefin tuna fishery through management measures including reduced fishing quotas and research (5). Some scientists and conservationists are worried however that the Commission does not go far enough and that global breeding stocks having been reduced by as much as 97% will require more drastic measures if they are ever to recover (6). ,fishing; , ,1,0.0

The main causes of habitat loss and degradation in Madagascar include human-caused fires conversion to agriculture charcoal production firewood exploitation and invasive alien plants (1) (11). Madagascarâ??s burgeoning human population can only cause this problem to worsen (11).,The Critically Endangered spider tortoise is protected by national law in Madagascar and listed on Appendix I of CITES which prohibits international trade in this species. Unfortunately compliance with the law is proving difficult to enforce with large numbers leaving the country illegally to support the exotic pet trade (4) (5) as well as being hunted for food by certain communities within Madagascar. The spider tortoiseâ??s occurrence in two protected areas (Lake Tsimanampetsotsa National Park and Cap Sainte-Marie Special Reserve) offers some much needed protection but owing to a lack of resources within the protected areas system habitat destruction and poaching still continues (4) (14). The need for a specific conservation action plan has been raised in addition to stricter measures to protect its habitat and the implementation of education programmes to try and protect this tortoise from hunting (9). These measures in addition to ensuring that populations of all <strong>subspecies</strong> are represented within protected areas (1) (15) are essential if the long-term survival of the spider tortoise is to be assured. ,loss;invasive;pet; ,cites;protected; ,3,2.0
1509,1509,Cyanopsitta spixii,spixs macaw ,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Psittaciformes,Psittacidae,Cyanopsitta ,Length: 55 - 57 cm (2),It is thought that the destruction of caraiba forest and other human activities over the last 500 years are largely responsible for the decline of the Spixâ??s macaw. More recently trapping for the illegal bird trade has driven this parrot to extinction in the wild (4) (5).,Until 2001 the Spixâ??s macaw recovery programme was coordinated and implemented through the Permanent Committee for the Recovery of the Spixâ??s Macaw (CPRAA) composed of the Brazilian government scientific advisors and Spixâ??s macaw holders (4). While the solitary male remained in the wild he was the subject of a number of study programmes and valuable information on the natural ecology and behaviour of this species was obtained (4). The wild male had mated with a blue-winged macaw (<em>Primoliismaracana</em>) and the pair successfully fostered blue-winged macaw nestlings which were introduced to them (4). This is an encouraging finding as wild blue-winged macaws could in theory be used to foster captive-bred Spixâ??s macaws in the same way (4). The future of Spixâ??s macaw depends on the success of the captive-bred population and its possible reintroduction into the wild. There have been recent problems however leading the Brazilian government to suspend CPRAA in 2001 due to internal conflicts (7). While the loss of Spixâ??s macaw in the wild was a devastating blow to the conservation programme if the different parties can cooperate there is hope that a wild population of Spixâ??s macaws can be successfully reintroduced. , , ,0,0.0

As with many coastal regions tidal mudflats are being reclaimed for industry or aquaculture. Pollution climate change and human disturbance have also altered the habitat of this species and hunting of shorebirds contributes to the decline of the spoon-billed sandpiper. Recent population surveys indicate an extremely rapid decline in this species with reduced productivity leading to fears that the population is ageing rapidly (2).,The spoon-billed sandpiper is protected in several areas throughout its range but would benefit from enforced legal protection wherever it is present. Shorebird hunting is prolific and affects many species; a ban would have wide-ranging benefits.

1511,1511,Brachionichthys hirsutus,spotted handfish ,Animalia,Chordata,Actinopterygii,Lophiiformes,Brachionichthyidae,Brachionichthys ,Length: 10 - 15 cm (2),The spotted handfish was common in the lower Derwent River estuary until the mid 1980s when the species underwent a catastrophic decline (2). Although unproven it is thought that the introduction of the northern Pacific seastar (<i>Asterias amurensis</i>) to Tasmania at this time may be the key to the decimation of the handfish population (3). These seastars are voracious predators of shellfish and it is thought that they may also eat the eggs of handfish or the sea squirts upon which the eggs are attached (2). The deterioration of coastal habitats due to development may also be involved in the decline (3). This species is under added threat from its vastly reduced population limited dispersal restricted distribution and low reproductive rate (3).,Just two spotted handfish were reported between 1990 and 1994; this dire state of the population led to the formation of the Spotted Handfish Recovery Team in 1996 (3). The Recovery Team consists of a number of government agencies concerned with saving this rare and bizarre fish. Research into existing wild populations and the development of captive breeding techniques are some of the priorities of the recovery plan (3).

1512,1512,Brachionichthys hirsutus,spotted handfish ,Animalia,Chordata,Actinopterygii,Lophiiformes,Brachionichthyidae,Brachionichthys ,Length: 10 - 15 cm (2),The spotted handfish was common in the lower Derwent River estuary until the mid 1980s when the species underwent a catastrophic decline (2). Although unproven it is thought that the introduction of the northern Pacific seastar (<i>Asterias amurensis</i>) to Tasmania at this time may be the key to the decimation of the handfish population (3). These seastars are voracious predators of shellfish and it is thought that they may also eat the eggs of handfish or the sea squirts upon which the eggs are attached (2). The deterioration of coastal habitats due to development may also be involved in the decline (3). This species is under added threat from its vastly reduced population limited dispersal restricted distribution and low reproductive rate (3).,Just two spotted handfish were reported between 1990 and 1994; this dire state of the population led to the formation of the Spotted Handfish Recovery Team in 1996 (3). The Recovery Team consists of a number of government agencies concerned with saving this rare and bizarre fish. Research into existing wild populations and the development of captive breeding techniques are some of the priorities of the recovery plan (3).

Today the landscape is altered beyond recognition and many of the <strong>endemic</strong> and unique species have been lost for ever (5). The introduction of goats and other livestock as well as the clearing of native forests for timber have ravaged the island; 60 percent of St Helena became barren ground known as the Crown Wastes following massive soil erosion (5). The St Helena boxwood appears to contain toxins that prevented it from being damaged by goats and therefore widespread erosion is likely to have been the main cause of its disappearance from the island (2).,Today all that survives of the St Helena boxwood are a precarious wild population and around 50 cultivated plants many situated at the Royal Botanic Gardens Kew in the UK (4). It is hoped that some of these will be returned to St Helena and <strong>re-introduced</strong> to the wild however early attempts at <strong>re-introduction</strong> have not proven successful and there is a lack of expertise on the island itself (4).

The St Helena ebony was once common in this area which stands as a pertinent warning of the effects of over-exploitation. Goats were introduced to the island in the early 16th Century in order to provide food for sailors passing through the area (4). Vast herds of wild goats roamed the island and fed on native plants such as the ebony; the low branches of this species made it highly accessible and seedlings were particularly vulnerable thus preventing population growth (4).,The St Helena ebony has proven easy to propagate and cuttings taken from the two remaining wild shrubs have been used to cultivate plants as part of the conservation programme for this species (4). Wild goats have been all but removed from the island following a concerted campaign in the 1960s (4). The ebony has been established in cultivation at two key sites: behind High Peak (not formerly within the range of the ebony) and Ebony Plain although limited regeneration has been observed at either site (3). There are currently around 2000 individuals (3) but these were all derived from the two remaining plants and subsequently have little genetic variation (4). At both sites the Ebony is planted with the hybrid <i>Trochetiopsis x benjaminii</i> Cronk also known as â??Rebonyâ?? and <strong>introgression</strong> is a possible threat (3).

A census carried out during 2005 and 2006 showed that this species had undergone a decline of more that 40 percent in just five years to a mere 235 individuals (3). There has since been a small increase in numbers however (6). The major factor suspected of causing the decline is a reduction in livestock grazing which has become unprofitable (2) and has led to longer grass swards and encroachment by shrubland (3). This is detrimental to breeding success as the birds rely on short swards in which to construct nests and forage. In addition to this threat growing populations of introduced predators are consuming large numbers of this speciesâ?? eggs and chicks. To compound these existing problems there are now plans to build an airport on St Helena potentially reducing available habitat and causing further disturbance and degradation due to tourist activity. With its population currently at the lowest level ever recorded the St Helena plover is perilously close to extinction and will require careful management to ensure its survival (3).,Protected by law on St Helena since 1894 in recent years the plight of the St Helena plover has galvanised a significant amount of attention from researchers and conservationists (2) (3).

At present around one third of the world's reef-building corals are threatened with extinction. The principal threat to corals is the rise in sea temperature associated with global climate change. This leads to coral bleaching where the symbiotic algae are expelled leaving the corals weak and vulnerable to an increasing variety of harmful diseases. Climate change is also expected cause more extreme weather incidents and to increase ocean acidification which impairs the coral's ability to form a skeleton. These global threats are compounded by localised threats from pollution destructive fishing practices invasive species and human development (6).,Staghorn corals are listed on Appendix II of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) and therefore trade in this coral should be carefully regulated and a permit is required to bring the coral or objects made from them into the countries that have signed the CITES convention (2).

1524,1524,Acipenser stellatus,stellate sturgeon ,Animalia,Chordata,Actinopterygii,Acipenseriformes,Acipenseridae,Acipenser ,Length: up to 2.18 metres (2),The major threat to the stellate sturgeonâ??s survival is overfishing for its meat and more significantly for caviar sold under the name â??sevrugaâ??. This is produced from the sturgeonâ??s unfertilised eggs and is almost always extracted by killing the female. The caviar industry is currently in crisis as the dwindling stocks of the stellate sturgeon and the other major caviar producing species can no longer provide sufficient caviar to meet the huge worldwide demand (2). Despite attempts to manage stellate sturgeon stocks illegal fishing and black market trade in caviar are threatening to drive this already endangered species to extinction (2) (7).,In 1998 the stellate sturgeon was listed by the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) meaning that all international trade in this species is controlled by maximum export quotas and trade permits (2) (3). The countries which are party to the CITES agreement must agree on sustainable catch and export quotas based on scientific surveys and must adopt regional conservation strategies and attempt to combat illegal fishing. The strict enforcement of these regulations meant that in 2006 caviar export was banned for all of the countries bordering the Caspian Sea since the countries failed to provide sufficient information about the sustainability of their catch. This promoted an agreement between the countries to reduce their stellate sturgeon caviar export quotas in 2007 by over 25 percent (8). The countries bordering the Black Sea have adopted an even stricter policy regarding their sturgeon stocks maintaining a zero quota policy which has continued into 2008 (9). Whether these reduced quotas will prove sufficient to allow the stellate sturgeonâ??s population to recover remains to be seen. ,fishing;overfishing;pollution; ,cites; ,3,1.0

Today however the islands of Jolo and Sanga-sanga have been almost completely logged and have consequently suffered the local extinction of the Sulu hornbill (5). Logging in Tawitawi has also caused the deleterious decline of the species in its final stronghold. Hunting has also been a major cause of the destruction of this species; nestlings are collected annually for food and adults are reportedly shot on site either for food or target practice (5). The tiny population of Sulu hornbills that remain is on the verge of extinction; political unrest in the region continues to hamper conservation efforts (2).,The Sulu hornbill does not currently occur within any protected areas (4) and is in grave danger of disappearing before it has been properly studied. Research into the life history and biology of this rare bird are urgently needed along with survey work and protection measures (2). The Sulu hornbill is listed on Appendix II of the Conventional on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) and the Mindano State University have carried out some public awareness campaigns (5).

However the main threat to orangutans today is loss of habitat (7). In the past twenty years 80 percent of orangutan habitat has been lost to illegal logging gold mining and conversion to permanent agriculture in particular palm oil plantations. What is special about these animals is their unique vulnerability to exploitation. Much of this may be attributed to their extremely long inter-birth interval typically eight years making them the slowest breeding primates on earth (7).,The Sumatran orangutan is fully protected by law in Indonesia and is listed on Appendix I of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) which bans international trade in this species.

Today the small isolated populations that remain continue to be primarily threatened by poaching (1) as sadly the Sumatran rhinoceros is one of the unfortunate animals that is highly valued in traditional Asian medicines. Many parts of its body are believed to have aphrodisiac and medicinal properties but its distinctive horn is most in demand and ends up either a powdered ingredient in medicines or artistically carved (2) (5). The populations of the Sumatran rhinoceros are now so small that breeding has become a rare activity and successful births are infrequent; as a result <strong>inbreeding depression</strong> has become a real and serious risk (1). The small numbers mean that even the death of a single animal brings the species a step closer to extinction (5).,Despite being listed on Appendix I of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) since 1975 (which prohibits trade in the species) (3) and being legally protected in all the countries in which it occurs (1) the Sumatran rhinoceros is still in a precarious situation.

The spread of alien vegetation and in particular the planting of exotic pines gums and poplars has resulted in the clogging of streams creating areas of stagnant water unsuitable for the Table Mountain ghost frog. Consequently even within its restricted range it has become locally extinct along certain stretches. Other potential threats include the construction of dams which reduce water flow frequent fires global climate change and intensive eco-tourism while in recent years the deadly fungal disease chytridiomycosis has been found in some populations of this Critically Endangered species (1) (2) (3).,The whole of the Table Mountain ghost frogâ??s range is incorporated within the Table Mountain National Park itself a part of the Cape Floristic World Heritage Site (1) (4). Given this species imperilled conservation status Western Cape Nature Conservation also has a monitoring programme in place (1). One of the main conservation priorities is to ensure the preservation of swift-flowing perennial mountain streams on Table Mountain. Furthermore with the looming threat of further cases of chytridiomycosis spreading through the population the establishment of a captive population may prove vital to this species survival (2) (3). ,disease; , ,1,0.0
1533,1533,Pomarea nigra,tahiti monarch ,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Monarchidae,Pomarea ,Length: 15 cm (2),The Tahiti monarch used to be common throughout the island but during the last century populations underwent a dramatic decrease and now number less than 50 restricted to a few valleys. These perilous declines have largely been the result of the accidental introduction of the black rat (<i>Rattus rattus</i>) to the island which prey on the eggs and chicks. However two introduced birds the Indian mynah and red-vented bulbul also pose a significant threat to the monarchâ??s survival. It is thought that the Indian mynah which was introduced to control wasps preys on eggs and chicks whereas the red-vented bulbul competes with the monarch for nest sites and territories (5).,In 1997 the total population was only 27 individuals. Since then a conservation programme was implemented and intensive surveys revealed the population had increased to 40 to 45 birds in 2004 (2) (3).

1534,1534,Pomarea nigra,tahiti monarch ,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Monarchidae,Pomarea ,Length: 15 cm (2),The Tahiti monarch used to be common throughout the island but during the last century populations underwent a dramatic decrease and now number less than 50 restricted to a few valleys. These perilous declines have largely been the result of the accidental introduction of the black rat (<i>Rattus rattus</i>) to the island which prey on the eggs and chicks. However two introduced birds the Indian mynah and red-vented bulbul also pose a significant threat to the monarchâ??s survival. It is thought that the Indian mynah which was introduced to control wasps preys on eggs and chicks whereas the red-vented bulbul competes with the monarch for nest sites and territories (5).,In 1997 the total population was only 27 individuals. Since then a conservation programme was implemented and intensive surveys revealed the population had increased to 40 to 45 birds in 2004 (2) (3). The recovery plan is largely focused on the control of the black rat.

The Taita apalis is thought to be confined to just five of the remaining tiny isolated forest fragments and these fragments are still under serious threat from agriculture plantations firewood extraction and cattle grazing which may prevent natural regeneration (2) (3) (5) (7) (8). Although now protected a lack of clear boundary demarcations can make it difficult to effectively conserve these forest fragments and wildfires are also a threat in some areas (2). This highly endangered bird was believed to number no more than 600 to 930 individuals in 2001 (2) (6) (7) and its population is fragmented into tiny isolated subpopulations (2) putting it at increased risk of extinction. Alarmingly surveys in 2009 and 2010 indicated a major crash in the remaining population with possibly only 60 to 130 birds now remaining although the causes of this dramatic decline are unclear (4). As it lives close to the maximum altitude within its range climate change is a potential threat as it could leave the Taita apalis with nowhere to move to if local conditions change (2).,Fortunately for the Taita apalis a range of conservation activities are now underway in the Taita Hills. The remaining forest fragments are being safeguarded by the Kenya Forest Department while Nature Kenya is committed to conservation in the area (2). An international research project is ongoing which includes studies into the Taita apalis (2) (9) and conservation actions include reforestation plans to reconnect forest patches and the development of alternative income-generating activities such as bee-keeping and butterfly-rearing. Local farmers have also been taught about responsible agricultural practices and tree nurseries have been established to provide native trees for restoring degraded habitat and fast-growing non-native trees to create buffer zones and to reduce pressure on the native forest (2) (6) (7). , , ,0,0.0

Today the surviving forest patches on which the highly specialised Taita thrush depends remain under serious threat from clearance and degradation. As a result the Taita thrush is currently listed as Critically Endangered on the IUCN Red List. One of the smaller sub-populations also has a highly male-biased sex ratio which might have significant consequences for the subpopulationâ??s long term survival (2) (3) (6) (7).,In cooperation with local communities considerable conservation work is underway in the Taita Hills. In order to restore existing forest fragments and hopefully enhance connectivity between them efforts are being made to reforest areas with indigenous seedlings. Farmers are also being educated in environmentally responsible agricultural practices and local people are being taught alternative income generating activities such as bee-keeping and butterfly rearing. In addition an ongoing collaborative research project is in place which will provide the ecological data necessary to implement appropriate conservation measures. As part of future conservation measures a translocation project for the most threatened subpopulation of the Taita thrush is being developed (2) (3) (6). , , ,0,0.0

The population of this species is thought to total no more than 600 individuals and is at risk from the effects of inbreeding (1).,The most important conservation measure for the Tenerife speckled lizard is the control of <strong>feral</strong> cat populations. Measures so far have included the use of fencing to exclude <strong>feral</strong> cats from the known habitat of the Tenerife speckled lizard (1).

The dramatic decline in numbers on Inaccessible Island is attributed to predation by feral pigs (now absent) and humans while the extinction on Tristan was probably the result of human exploitation in addition to predation by rats. On Gough storms have caused peat slips that have buried and killed nesting adults although this is likely to be only a very rare occurrence (3). The main threat comes from <strong>bycatch</strong> from longline fisheries with satellite tracking indicating a substantial overlap between the range of these birds and areas where longline fisheries are well known for their high rates of seabird bycatch mortality (3) (9). Furthermore if one parent is lost at sea the other cannot cope with the food demands of their chick and the chick will most probably die. Astonishing recent research has also shown that invasive introduced house mice three times the size of those in Europe are also devastating seabird populations on Gough Island by preying upon chicks (3) (10).

Most of this destruction has occurred at lower elevations in the <strong>submontane forest</strong> the preferred habitat of this species (2) (3) (4) (5) (8). A further threat introduced to the area more recently is banana farming with bananas planted beneath the forest canopy as a cash crop (3) (4) (9). Unfortunately this involves clearing shrubs and thinning the trees as well as gradually felling further trees to provide additional nutrients for the banana plants. Eventually this process destroys the forest with the land then usually converted to subsistence maize farming (9).,Uluguru North and Uluguru South Forest Reserves are managed as important water catchment areas for the 3.5 million people of the city of Dar-es-Salaam and are also of high importance in terms of biodiversity (2) (5) (8) (9). There are plans underway to reconnect the two reserves and to upgrade them to the status of Nature Reserve (2) (5) (7) and a range of conservation projects are underway in the area including work with local communities habitat restoration further surveys of the Uluguru bush-shrike population and monitoring of the speciesâ?? preferred habitat (2) (7) (8) (9). The development of ecotourism may also provide an alternative source of income for local people and an incentive to protect the forest (8) (9). Further conservation measures recommended for this rare <strong>endemic</strong> bird include additional monitoring and population estimates increased efforts to reduce firewood and timber harvesting within the reserves reforestation at lower elevations raising awareness of the importance of the area and continuing to work closely with local communities to ensure the appropriate management and sustainable utilisation of forest resources (2) (5) (8). ,loss; , ,1,0.0

In the early 20th century the eastern mosquitofish <i>Gambusia holbrooki</i> was introduced to the <strong>Iberian Peninsula</strong> in order to control malaria. The fish were not only successful in preying upon the mosquito larvae found in the wetland water bodies but were also more efficient at foraging than the native Valencia toothcarp. The invasive fish were therefore able to out-compete the Valencia toothcarp for resources during periods of scarcity and have promoted the native speciesâ?? decline (7). This has been compounded by the increasing habitat loss and degradation predominantly fuelled by the fact that the Valencia toothcarpâ??s range is a popular tourist destination. Many areas of this speciesâ?? wetland habitat have been drained to make way for development and to reduce mosquito breeding grounds (3) while the remainder are affected by urban and agricultural pollution (1). At present the Valencia toothcarp is perilously close to extinction with just ten wild populations of which only five have favourable conservation status (2),The Valencia toothcarp is listed in the Annexes II and IV of the European Union Habitats Directive and in the Appendix II of the Bern Convention both of which require that efforts are made to protect this species and its habitat (1). In order to fulfil this requirement three European action programmes have been developed to create a reserve network within this the Valencia toothcarpâ??s range. In addition since 1993 extensive reintroductions have been carried out restocking regions from which this species was previously extirpated. Nevertheless further protection is still required for the remaining wild populations along with the continuation of reintroductions and implementation of educational programmes to raise awareness of this threatened speciesâ?? plight (2). ,loss;invasive;pet;pollution; , ,4,0.0

Sadly the speciesâ?? large size deems it an easy target for hunters while its slow reproductive rate and generally low population densities makes it especially vulnerable to population collapses as a result of over-hunting (4). The habitat of the hybrid spider monkey (<i>A. h. hybridus</i>) is patchily distributed and there is a concern that few populations remain that are of an adequate size to be viable in the mid to long term. Populations are failing to be actively managed even within protected areas. However the brown spider monkey (<i>A. h. brunneus</i>) does not occur in any protected area and its population size is thought to be much smaller than that of the nominate subspecies (1). The brown spider monkey (<i>A. h. brunneus</i>) has a small geographic range where forest loss degradation and fragmentation are unfortunately widespread. Thus this subspecies has been officially recognised in 2004 and 2006 as one of the worldâ??s 25 most endangered primates (4).,The hybrid spider monkey (<i>A. h. hybridus</i>) is known to occur in 4 protected areas: Catatumbo-BarÃ­ El Cocuy National Park and TamÃ¡ National Park in Colombia and Guatopo National Park in Venezuela (2).

Deforestation in the Philippines has been widespread and habitat loss along with hunting pressure is one of the main causes of the precipitous decline in numbers. Interbreeding with domestic pigs provides a further threat to the few surviving populations and it seems unlikely that purebred forms will persist in the wild for long (4). These pigs also suffer from persecution by local farmers who view the animals as pests; they are subject to high levels of illegal hunting pressure for local consumption are caught in pitfall traps or wire snares and may sometimes be killed with explosive devices that are baited and buried in the ground to be excavated by rooting individuals (6).,The Visayan Warty Pig Conservation Programme was established in 1991 (4) with the long-term aim of reintroducing 'warties' into areas from which they have been lost (3).

1567,1567,Aceros waldeni,visayan wrinkled hornbill ,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Coraciiformes,Bucerotidae,Aceros ,Length: 60 - 65 cm (2),Habitat loss in the form of deforestation has been the major cause of a precipitous decline in the Visayan wrinkled hornbill and has resulted in its local extinction from the island of Guimaras (4). Shifting agriculture has cleared vast areas of forest and development and plantations have also played a part in habitat loss (7). In 1988 it was estimated that only four percent of Negros and eight percent of Panay remained forested (4). These birds have also been hunted for food and for collection for the pet trade in parts of their range and the isolated fragments of populations that remain are extremely vulnerable to any chance events such as the local failure of fruiting trees (4).,In 2001 the Visayan wrinkled hornbill was on the brink of extinction with only 60 to 80 breeding pairs remaining in the wild (8) (9). Fortunately effective conservation measures initiated by the Philippine Endemic Species Conservation Project (PESCP) saw the number of occupied nest holes on Panay increase to 1108 in 2008 (9). This was achieved primarily through a highly successful nest guarding scheme involving local communities (8) (9).

There are also significant concerns over the possible effects of a road situated very near to one of the locations where the frog has been located (1). In addition various species of water frog are sometimes consumed as part of drink with supposed aphrodisiac qualities and this may also have contributed to the decline of this species (7).,Despite <em>Telmatobius espadai </em>being classified as Critically Endangered by the IUCN Red List there are presently no known conservation methods in place for this species and no current information on its status.

Western gorillas are very susceptible to the illegal bushmeat trade as gorilla meat is viewed as a symbol of wealth and prestige (8).

Western gorillas are very susceptible to the illegal bushmeat trade as gorilla meat is viewed as a symbol of wealth and prestige (8). Male gorillas will actively defend their females and offspring if their group encounters a threat and this increases their chances of being killed by a hunter (8).,The western gorilla is listed on Appendix I of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) (3) and there has been a decline in international trade of the species (4). The United Nations Environmental Program (UNEP) has recognised the urgent need to protect our closest relatives and has established a Great Ape Survival Project (GRASP) aimed at identifying the conservation initiatives required to secure the future of the apes and at obtaining political support and funding to allow these to be achieved (9). ,loss; ,cites; ,1,1.0

However the most extensive and rapid deforestation in the latter half of the century has been caused by commercial logging with has particularly impacted the valuable primary lowland dipterocarp forests which shrunk from an estimated 10 million hectares in the 1950s to only one million by the late 1980s (7). Forest clearance and habitat degradation throughout Borneo and the Philippines may also be having a detrimental effect on the treeâ??s natural pollinators reducing the rate at which the species can reproduce and recover its populations (4).,This threatened species is located in a proposed reserve site (1) which if awarded official reserve status in the future would confer some degree of protection to the species. The Philippinesâ?? Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR) has also established a <strong>genebank</strong> of economically useful <strong>endemic</strong> and endangered forest tree species including white seraya (8).

The <strong>Atlantic coastal forest</strong> of Brazil is highly threatened by habitat loss mainly in the form of clearance for sugarcane and coffee plantations and pressure from urbanisation (7) (8) (13). Within this speciesâ?? range massive deforestation has drastically reduced forest cover to less than one percent of its former extent and the small remaining forest fragments are under continued threat from logging as well as from fires (3) (10). In addition a lack of knowledge about the white-collared kite whose very existence as a distinct species was still debated as recently as 2005 hinders efforts to conserve it (5) (6) (8). ,The white-collared kite is listed on Appendix II of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) meaning that any international trade in the species should be carefully monitored (4). In addition a large area of Murici Alagoas is legally protected and organisations such as the Instituto para a PreservaÃ§Ã£o da Mata AtlÃ¢ntica (IPMA) are working to create forest reserves on privately-owned land (3) (10). Further surveys and research into the white-collared kite are urgent priorities (3) (6) (10) and studies have been recommended to clarify its <strong>taxonomic</strong> status using genetic analysis (3). The designation of Murici as a biological reserve and the protection of other forest areas (3) (10) (13) such as Mata do Coimbra Ibateguara Alagoas (12) will also be important to its continued survival. Birds of prey make ideal charismatic â??flagshipâ?? species for conservation (6) and so any efforts to conserve this highly endangered kite would also be likely to benefit many of the other threatened species that share its fragile habitat. ,loss; ,cites;protected; ,1,2.0

The focus of conservation efforts must fall primarily on the Cat Ba Island <strong>subspecies</strong> with possibly as few as 59 individuals remaining today. This shockingly low number is the result of a massive 98% decline over the course of 40 years from between 2500 and 2800 individuals in the 1960s to just 53 in 2000. Such a dangerously small population of Cat Ba langurs gives the impression that the Chinese <strong>subspecies</strong> <i>Trachypithecus poliocephalus leucocephalus</i> is thriving with between 600 and 800 individuals alive today. This is of course far from the truth particularly as declines were recorded in the populations at Longgang National Nature Reserve and the Fusui Rare and Precious Animal Reserve in 1998 (5).,With just 53 Cat Ba langurs in the wild and two in captivity at the Endangered Primate Rescue Centre of Cuc Phuong National Park the Cat Ba Langur Conservation Project was started in 2000 by MÅ±nster Zoo and the Zoological Society for the Conservation of Species and Populations (ZGAP). Given the cause of the langurâ??s decline the main aim of the project was to halt poaching with the additional intention of promoting conservation awareness amongst the inhabitants of Cat Ba Island. The project has been extremely successful in dramatically reducing deaths as a result of poaching bringing the number from 30 deaths in the eight months prior to its start to three deaths in the first four years of the project. In this time nine langurs were born and have survived. The langurs are closely monitored and protection measures are in place particularly in the newly created langur sanctuary within the National Park.

These camels continue to be persecuted mainly as they are seen as competition with domestic livestock for the precious water and grazing of the desert (1). Bactrian camels persisted in China even though the Gashun Gobi desert (Lop Nur) was used as a nuclear test site for 45 years (3) today further habitat loss has occurred with the development of a gas pipe-line in the north of the reserve (1) and highly toxic illegal mining (3). Competition with domestic camels and livestock as well as <strong>hybridisation</strong> with domestic camels poses a further threat to the survival of the unique Bactrian camel (1). The total population is predicted to undergo an 80% reduction over the next three generations prompting the species to be listed as Critically Endangered by the World Conservation Union (IUCN) (1).,Areas of the Gobi and Gashun Gobi desert (Lop Nur) where the Bactrian camel remain are protected by the Great Gobi Reserve in Mongolia which was established in 1982 and by the newly established national reserve â??Lop Nur Wild Camel Reserveâ?? in China (1) (7). Both governments have agreed to protect this trans-boundary migrating species in a historic move (3). A captive breeding programme based in Mongolia and run by the Wild Camel Protection Foundation began in 2003 in an effort to safeguard the future of this fascinating animal (3). Recent studies of dromedary (one-humped) camels (<em>Camelus dromedarius</em>) have revealed an extraordinary immune system; camel milk has been found to arrest diabetes in humans and has proved to be a substitute for insulin with these results prompting hopes that further studies of the wild Bactrian camel may yield similarly remarkable discoveries (3) (7). ,loss;pet; ,captive breeding;protected; ,2,2.0
1594,1594,Camelus ferus,wild bactrian camel ,Animalia,Chordata,Mammalia,Cetartiodactyla,Camelidae,Camelus ,600 â?? 1000 kg (2),Wild Bactrian camels have been heavily hunted for their meat and hide over the centuries (4) and today only a few highly fragmented populations persist (1). These camels continue to be persecuted mainly as they are seen as competition with domestic livestock for the precious water and grazing of the desert (1). Bactrian camels persisted in China even though the Gashun Gobi desert (Lop Nur) was used as a nuclear test site for 45 years (3) today further habitat loss has occurred with the development of a gas pipe-line in the north of the reserve (1) and highly toxic illegal mining (3). Competition with domestic camels and livestock as well as <strong>hybridisation</strong> with domestic camels poses a further threat to the survival of the unique Bactrian camel (1). The total population is predicted to undergo an 80% reduction over the next three generations prompting the species to be listed as Critically Endangered by the World Conservation Union (IUCN) (1).,Areas of the Gobi and Gashun Gobi desert (Lop Nur) where the Bactrian camel remain are protected by the Great Gobi Reserve in Mongolia which was established in 1982 and by the newly established national reserve â??Lop Nur Wild Camel Reserveâ?? in China (1) (7). Both governments have agreed to protect this trans-boundary migrating species in a historic move (3).

1595,1595,Wollemia nobilis,wollemi pine ,Plantae,Tracheophyta,Coniferopsida,Coniferales,Araucariaceae,Wollemia ,Height: 35 m (2),The remaining population of Wollemi pines may represent a relict of the previous extent of this species; it is thought that these trees may have been undergoing a slow natural decline for thousands of years (3). The species is today threatened by the small size and limited range of its population which is intrinsically at risk from any chance event that may occur such as fire or the spread of disease (3).,The Wollemi pine is protected in Australia and the population is located within the Wollemi Pine National Park. A Recovery Plan has been drawn up outlining strategies for the management of this fragile population; the overall objective is to ensure that this species remains viable in the long-term (3). Such a fascinating tree may have much to reveal about ancient species that were previously known only from fossils. Its discovery underlines the vital role that habitat conservation has to play in the preservation of biodiversity (3). ,disease; ,protected; ,1,1.0
1596,1596,Plagopterus argentissimus,woundfin ,Animalia,Chordata,Actinopterygii,Cypriniformes,Cyprinidae,Plagopterus ,Length: up to 10 cm (2),From being the most abundant species in the Virgin River the woundfin has suffered a dramatic population decline (2). Loss and fragmentation of its habitat due to human activities is thought to be a major contributing factor in this decline (1) (4). The damming of the rivers and use of the water for agriculture and mining have also led to changes in the flow regimes of the rivers in the woundfinâ??s range (2) (4).,A major priority for the conservation of the woundfin is the protection and monitoring of its remaining habitat (4). Research is also being carried out in order to refine captive breeding methods so that this species can be re-introduced back into its historic range. However previous attempts to reintroduce the woundfin have proved unsuccessful (4). ,loss;fragmentation; ,cites;captive breeding; ,2,2.0

1598,1598,Rothmannia annae,wrights gardenia ,Plantae,Tracheophyta,Magnoliopsida,Rubiales,Rubiaceae,Rothmannia ,Height: up to 6 m (2),Wright's gardenia is restricted to one single population on Aride Island in the Seychelles. Other nearby populations have become extinct for unknown reasons which could also affect the only remaining population. Although the reason for local extinction is unknown it is thought that introduced pests may have been the cause as well as competition with <em>Pisonia grandis</em>. The highly restricted range of Wrightâ??s gardenia makes it particularly vulnerable to extinction (1).,The island of Aride is a Special Reserve (1) and has been the focus of a long-running habitat restoration programme carried out by the Royal Society for Nature Conservation which involves the removal of introduced plants such as coconut palms (3). Almost all non-native trees have been removed and <strong>endemics</strong> such as Wright's gardenia have been planted and are showing encouraging sings of recovery (3). Stands of Wright's gardenia have also been planted on the islands of Fregate and Silhouette; the first wild germination on an island other than Aride for over 100 years has recently occurred on Fregate (3). Careful monitoring and management of these populations are required but the future of this beautiful tree now appears more secure thanks to concerted conservation efforts in the Seychelles. ,pet; , ,1,0.0

1600,1600,Acipenser dabryanus,yangtze sturgeon ,Animalia,Chordata,Actinopterygii,Acipenseriformes,Acipenseridae,Acipenser ,16 kg (2),The Yangtze sturgeon is at risk from over-fishing pollution and habitat degradation and loss. An important factor in its decline was the construction of the Gezhouba Dam across the Yangtze River at Yichang in Hubei Province in 1981. As this prevented upstream migration necessary for spawning the Yangtze sturgeon is now only found above the dam (2).,Conservation of this fish is now urgent with emphasis needed on habitat protection capture control and stock replenishment. This sturgeon species spawns earlier in life than most sturgeons and therefore has aquaculture potential for caviar production. Controlled production of the Yangtze sturgeon could both reduce fishing levels and allow <strong>reintroductions</strong> of fish back into the river (2). ,loss;fishing;pollution; , ,3,0.0

Not only is the very limited range of this monkey being reduced due to deforestation but the yellow-breasted capuchin is trapped for the pet trade and hunted for meat (6).,Some protection of this species is achieved as a result of its presence in the Una Biological Reserve the CondurÃº State Park (2) and at two biological research stations. A survey of this species is being conducted believed to be among the rarest of Neotropical primates (2) but numbers will continue to decline unless the habitat of the yellow-breasted capuchin is protected (6). ,pet; ,protected; ,1,1.0
1602,1602,Cacatua sulphurea,yellowcrested cockatoo ,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Psittaciformes,Psittacidae,Cacatua ,350 g (2),The main factor responsible for the precipitous decline of all of the races of the yellow-crested cockatoo has been unsustainable over-exploitation for the pet trade. Habitat loss has also played a part in the decline (4).,The yellow-crested cockatoo is now fully protected by Indonesian law and international trade is restricted by CITES. It occurs within a number of protected areas and a species Recovery Plan was initiated in 1998. This programme continues today and is making progress in five key areas namely: controlling trade conserving key habitats removing the market demand for wild birds by establishing captive breeding facilities research into ecology and population dynamics and awareness campaigns (4). ,loss;pet; ,cites;captive breeding;protected; ,2,3.0
