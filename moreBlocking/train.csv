In addition this cycad is used in numerous ways by the local human population and some of this exploitation is having a negative impact on cycad numbers. <i>Cycas circinalis</i> is heavily harvested for its leaves with young leaves being used as food and medicine by indigenous and local communities and the mature leaves being sold in the floriculture industry (7). The biggest impact on <i>C. circinalis </i>populations however comes from the harvest of pith and male cone for the medicinal plant industry. While much of this harvest is illegal it is very difficult to patrol (7). It is not only the cycad itself that this harvesting may threaten; the harvesting of its seeds for human consumption appears to have little negative impact on <i>Cycas circinalis</i> populations but very heavy seed harvest could have an impact on the bats which reportedly feed on the seeds (7).,Significant populations of <i>Cycas circinalis</i> still exist in a number of national parks and forest reserves (2) which offers this species some protection. To reduce harvesting pressure on populations it has been suggested that people need to be encouraged to use substitutes. For example the floriculture industry could use leaves from cultivated palms that are faster growing.

Habitat degradation and conversion to developments for tourism human settlements and road construction are particularly severe problems while predation from introduced mammals such as rats and mongoose also threatens many native species (6). As a result of these threats the range of the Virgin Islands coqui has become highly fragmented and there is an ongoing decline in the quality of its habitat. The small distinct population on Great Dog is particularly vulnerable. The Virgin Islands coqui also appears to be declining with the spread of the predatory Cuban tree frog (<em>Osteopilus septentrionalis</em>) (1).<em>  </em>,A number of conservation recommendations have been made to protect the native fauna of the British Virgin Islands including the creation of protected areas and minimising the impacts of development through the better enforcement of protective legislation. Increased monitoring efforts for amphibian populations may also be required given the potential for deadly diseases such as the fungus chytridiomycosis to break out on the island especially as disease has been associated with dramatic amphibian declines on nearby islands (6). Additional study and protection of the Virgin Islands coqui population on Great Dog is a conservation priority for the species while there is also a need to afford its habitat on Tortola and Virgin Gorda increased protection and control invasive predators (1) (6). , ,protected; ,0,1.0,yes,0

    Hunting for the purposes of traditional ""medicine"" is the primary threat facing this species; most of the populations that survive are heavily reduced and fragmented. Only the subpopulation at Van Long, with about 50 individuals, is thought likely to survive given the current hunting pressure; however, quarrying for limestone (cement), which is currently taking place there, has affected the ranging behaviour of the animals (T. Nadler pers. comm.). The smallest groups are extremely unlikely to survive should the one reproductively active male be taken or killed (Nadler 2004). Forest loss is a more minor threat as it occurs in degraded areas. A potential threat is the rapid development of tourist facilities adjacent to protected areas, especially around Van Long and Hoa Lu Nature Reserves.

    
  ","[""\n    This species is currently listed only as CITES Appendix II. It is considered 'endangered' in Viet Nam, and is listed as a 'most endangered' species under Annex 1B of Decree 32 (2006). It occurs in six protected areas, but many still experience high hunting pressure. Van Long Nature Reserve was established for this species in 2001, and there has been some evidence of population growth in this reserve in the past five years. The connection of forest fragments in some already protected areas, such as Van Long, could greatly increase the size and survivability of some subpopulations. Also considered as beneficial population management for this species are the translocation of severely threatened (small) groups to safe and suitable habitat, and the augmentation of existing groups with offspring from a captive population. Delacour's langurs have been successfully kept and bred in captivity at the Endangered Primate Rescue Center in Cuc Phuong National Park, Viet Nam, which is currently the only collection keeping this species (Nadler 2004). It is necessary to ensure the sustainability of these programs.

During the 1990s when Vietnam opened itself up to the international community and the Chinese economy started to boom traders and poachers moved in to utilise Vietnamâ??s biodiversity (4). Poachers killed this langur not only for meat but also for bones organs and tissues that are used in traditional medicines (8). Hunting has reduced in recent years with increasing legal protection but continues to pose a significant threat. Habitat loss is also a danger to this species with the World Conservation Monitoring Centre of the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP-WCMC) estimating that a total of 30000 hectares of forest are destroyed each year in Vietnam (4). The clearing of forests to accommodate human commercial and residential growth continues to separate the remaining populations of Delacourâ??s langur which are now at risk of becoming too small to be viably sustainable (2). Sixty percent of Delacourâ??s langurs occur in isolated populations of fewer than 20 individuals. The loss of these sub-populations and consequently 60 percent of the whole population is feared likely in the near future without management strict regulations and law enforcement (5).,Four areas where Delacourâ??s langurs are protected include: Cuc Phuong National Park Pu Luong Nature Reserve Hoa Lu Cultural and Historical Site and the recently-established Van Long Nature Reserve which is believed to contain the largest remaining population of around 70 individuals (5) (8). Unfortunately protected areas often suffer more from poaching than unprotected areas because their dense population of wildlife is seen as more profitable (2). Thus conservation groups are working to increase the level of protection and law enforcement within these protected areas. The Van Long Nature Reserve is now well guarded by rangers largely funded by the Frankfurt Zoological Society. The Pu Luong Nature Reserve also employs a large number of rangers which are helping to save the small remaining populations (8). These are encouraging steps towards helping the survival of Delacourâ??s langur listed as one of the 25 most endangered primates in the world (8). Recent commitments by the Vietnamese government and several international conservation organisations to do more to protect Delacourâ??s langur have greatly increased the chances of saving this rare and remarkable species (2). ,loss;hunting;environment; ,protected; ,3,1.0,yes,1

Today habitat destruction is the most pressing threat to species survival with rainforests being cleared throughout the region to make way for rice fields in an effort to cope with the human population explosion (2). Locals in this area are also in contact with the infamous esturine or 'saltwater' crocodile (<i>Crocodylus porosus</i>) which is one of the largest reptiles in the world and has a reputation as a man-eater. This factor undoubtedly contributes to local intolerance of any crocodile species even the small Philippine crocodile which is often killed when encountered (5). The very word for 'crocodile' in the Filipino language is a vile insult (7).,Next to the Chinese alligator (<i>Alligator sinensis</i>) the Philippine crocodile is considered to be the most endangered crocodilian in the world. Some authorities believe there may be less than 100 individuals left in the wild (3) although some wild habitat still remains. Urgent research is needed to assess the current status in order to implement an effective management strategy for this remaining wild population (3). This species is protected from international trade by its listing on Appendix I of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) but there is only one officially protected area within the Philippines and this is poorly enforced (3). At present captive breeding takes place in a small programme run by the Silliman University and at the government-run Crocodile Farming Institute which breeds crocodiles for commercial and conservation reasons (3). Sadly there is currently little political will or local tolerance to save this ancient reptile in the wild and for the short term at least captive breeding programmes may be the key to the at least nominal survival of this crocodile (3). , ,cites;captive breeding;protected; ,0,3.0,yes,1

    The species is consumed by humans and is prized for its meat (both subsistence and commercial use for tourists), which has contributed to its decline. Substantial habitat loss is also taking place over much of its range due to agriculture, human settlement and pressure from touristic development. On Montserrat, populations in the South Soufriere Hills, Soufriere Hills and Garibaldi Hill have been lost to lava flows from recent volcanic eruptions. The population of Dominica, where the species was once most abundant, has declined catastrophically from 2002 until the present, following a major confirmed outbreak of the fungal disease chytridiomycosis. This decline is continuing and appears to have significantly impacted most, if not all, of the population in that country.

Since lungless salamanders need a damp environment to maintain the moist skin on which oxygen uptake depends (4) any alteration in moisture conditions poses a severe threat. Therefore although it still survives in shaded plantations and sugarcane fields any clearance of these to create more open drier habitats would have a negative impact on this species (1). Similarly climate change may also pose a threat and already appears to be causing dramatic declines in other Central American salamanders (12). Although there is not yet any direct evidence that the fungal disease chytridiomycosis has contributed to these declines its role in the decline of many other amphibian species suggests that it may also be a potential threat (12).,No specific conservation measures are currently known to be in place for Salvinâ??s mushroomtongue salamander but the maintenance of shaded habitats has been identified as being important to its long-term survival (1). The species may potentially occur within the Parque Nacional El Imposible in El Salvador although this is not yet confirmed.

As the Olifants River region experiences hot dry summers water is extracted from the main river and its tributaries to irrigate the surrounding agricultural land.  Impoundments are also constructed to store water after the winter rainy season.  Furthermore river beds are bulldozed into wide channels to prevent the adjacent land from being flooded in the rainy season (2).  Such activities greatly alter the habitat of the sawfin and restrict its ability to move freely between different areas.,CapeNature a public institution responsible for biodiversity in the Western Cape (5) classifies the sawfin as endangered which makes it an offence to remove captured fish from rivers and dams.  CapeNature also undertakes regular surveys of the Olifants River system and has successfully cultured the sawfin since 1994.  Juveniles are then introduced to suitable natural habitats or stocked into farm dams to establish refuge populations.  Small parts of the sawfinâ??s range fall within protected areas including the Cedarberg Matjies River and Oorlogskloof Nature Reserves (2).  However to ensure the sawfinâ??s future it is vital to protect the habitat in the specific tributaries and the small section of the Olifants River mainstream where the sawfin remains abundant.  In addition efforts to prevent further introductions of alien predatory fish species are imperative (2). ,fragmentation; ,protected; ,1,1.0,yes,0

Today habitat destruction is the most pressing threat to species survival with rainforests being cleared throughout the region to make way for rice fields in an effort to cope with the human population explosion (2). Locals in this area are also in contact with the infamous esturine or 'saltwater' crocodile (<i>Crocodylus porosus</i>) which is one of the largest reptiles in the world and has a reputation as a man-eater. This factor undoubtedly contributes to local intolerance of any crocodile species even the small Philippine crocodile which is often killed when encountered (5). The very word for 'crocodile' in the Filipino language is a vile insult (7).,Next to the Chinese alligator (<i>Alligator sinensis</i>) the Philippine crocodile is considered to be the most endangered crocodilian in the world. Some authorities believe there may be less than 100 individuals left in the wild (3) although some wild habitat still remains. Urgent research is needed to assess the current status in order to implement an effective management strategy for this remaining wild population (3). This species is protected from international trade by its listing on Appendix I of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) but there is only one officially protected area within the Philippines and this is poorly enforced (3).

Unfortunately urbanisation and agricultural activities are increasingly encroaching upon the speciesâ?? habitat and consequently the speciesâ?? habitat has dwindled and the population has declined (4). The principle agent behind this decline is the extraction of ground water for agriculture and human consumption causing breeding areas to dry up. Streams have also been dammed to form fish-farm ponds while pollutants seeping into the water table from septic tanks and sewer pipelines continue to degrade this rare speciesâ?? habitat (4) (5). These threats are compounded by the speciesâ?? short life span as two consecutive poor breeding seasons could wipe out a substantial portion of the remaining population (4) (6).,The future of the slackwater darter is very much dependant on the careful management of its habitat (4). The conservation objectives for this Endangered species are set out in a detailed recovery plan with the protection of both breeding and non-breeding habitat a key priority (6).

Road kills may pose a significant threat particularly during the breeding season when the toads migrate to the breeding sites (1) (2) and urban development can also increase the physical barriers to such movements (2). In addition artificial water bodies with vertical sides such as swimming pools and stormwater drains can present death traps to toads while further threats at some breeding sites include pollution and introduced species such as predatory fish invasive plants and captive ducks which can consume eggs and tadpoles. The replacement of lawns and flowerbeds with stone and paving may also be reducing available foraging habitat (2) and there is increasing concern that the introduced guttural toad <i>Amietophrynus gutturalis</i> may compete with the western leopard toad for food and resources (8). An isolated population in the east of the range appears to be most under threat despite occurring in the least urbanised habitat (9).,The western leopard toad is legally protected within South Africa (2) and also occurs in some protected areas such as the Agulhas National Park and in the northern parts of Cape of Good Hope Nature Reserve. However most of its habitat occurs outside of reserves and is unprotected (1) (2). Fortunately a number of organisations are working to involve the public and private landholders in the toadâ??s conservation. In 2007 the Western Leopard Toad Conservation Committee (WLT-CC) was formed and are helping to draft a Biodiversity Management Plan for the species (2) (9). Volunteers help rescue toads from roads during the breeding season and photographs sent in by the public are being used to monitor the toad population identifying individuals by their unique markings (2) (5). Genetic studies radio-tracking and monitoring of the invasive guttural toad are also underway (2) (5) (8) and local residents have been given advice on making swimming pools safer for toads (2).

    Historical exploitation for its valuable timber during the 19th centry led to a reduction of up to 95%. One consequence of this was the expansion of fynbos, a highly flammable vegetation formation. More frequent and more intense fires prevent regeneration; surviving trees are restricted to rocky ridges, ledges, and outcrops mostly beyond reach of the flames. Natural regeneration is also hampered as a result of granivory and herbivory by native rodents.

The wood is considered enormously valuable being very fragrant and resistant to termites borers and fungal disease. It is used locally for making carvings boxes and furniture sold to tourists and is also sold abroad for light construction and flooring. The timber is thought to be particularly good for boat-building to the point that fishery officials have urged that remaining supplies be reserved for the Lake Malawi fishing industry. The Forestry Department of Malawi have recently agreed to supply Mulanje Cedar to build 450 boats for this purpose (11). The treeâ??s decline has been somewhat stemmed by a ban on felling allowing exploitation only of dead trees but illegal felling and killing of trees continues at an alarming rate. The Mulanje Mountain Forest Reserve is also generally threatened by encroachment and large-scale development such as the continual threat of bauxite mining. Additionally there is concern that mature individuals appear to be dying at a high rate thought possibly to be due to their high sensitivity to forest fires and susceptibility to attacks by a species of aphid (3). Regeneration on the other hand seems to depend on fire and is extremely poor. In addition <i>Pinus patula</i> (originally a commercial plantation species) has invaded a number of areas suitable for <i>Widdringtonia</i> colonisation (5) (9). All these threats have greatly impacted the Mulanje cedar; a 2007 study found that the remaining Mulanje cedar forests had been reduced by 40 percent over the previous 15 years (3). Out of the remaining 845.3 hectares of forest identified over 32 percent of standing Mulanje cedar was found to be dead (3). As so much dead wood is available for utilisation there should be no reason to cut live Mulanje cedar (3).,All Mulanje cedars are protected within the Mulanje Mountain Forest Reserve and licences are available now only for the exploitation of dead trees from the Forestry Department of Malawi (3) (9). The Mulanje Mountain Conservation Trust has also been set up to provide long-term support for the research and conservation of biological diversity in the Mulanje Mountain Forest Reserve and the sustainable utilisation of its natural resources. The Trust is working with the Forestry Department of Malawi in bringing in community participation to manage the resources of the forest reserve and maximise the benefits among resource users (12). Not only is the Mulanje cedar a national emblem to Malawi but it is also of critical financial importance to this relatively poor country and as such its protection and sustainable use is a national priority (6). ,fishing;disease; ,protected; ,2,1.0,yes,0

    This species is highly restricted in distribution, occurs in generally small subpopulations, and shows little evidence of recovering from historical habitat losses without significant positive human intervention. Principle causes of decline include impoundments, channelization, pollution, and sedimentation that have altered or eliminated those habitats that are essential to the long-term viability of many riverine mussel populations. Detailed information on these threats can be found in USFWS (2003).  Many of the impacts discussed in USFWS (2003) occurred in the past as unintended consequences of human development in the Apalachicolan Region. However, the species and its habitats continue to be impacted by excessive sediment bed loads of smaller sediment particles, changes in turbidity, increased suspended solids (primarily resulting from nonpoint-source loading from poor land-use practices, lack of BMPs, and maintenance of existing BMPs), and pesticides. Other primarily localized impacts include gravel mining, reduced water quality below dams, developmental activities, water withdrawal, impoundments, and alien species. Toxic spills are also a possibility in all extant populations (USFWS 2003).  Siltation from poorly conducted agricultural and silvicultural activities; chicken farm litter nutrients; localized industrial, municipal, and residential pollution; watershed development (bridge, highway construction projects, etc.), urban sprawl in upper Flint and Chattahoochee may impact potential populations; competition from Asian Clam is a possibility.

Since lungless salamanders need a damp environment to maintain the moist skin on which oxygen uptake depends (4) any alteration in moisture conditions poses a severe threat. Therefore although it still survives in shaded plantations and sugarcane fields any clearance of these to create more open drier habitats would have a negative impact on this species (1). Similarly climate change may also pose a threat and already appears to be causing dramatic declines in other Central American salamanders (12). Although there is not yet any direct evidence that the fungal disease chytridiomycosis has contributed to these declines its role in the decline of many other amphibian species suggests that it may also be a potential threat (12).,No specific conservation measures are currently known to be in place for Salvinâ??s mushroomtongue salamander but the maintenance of shaded habitats has been identified as being important to its long-term survival (1).

During the dry season, they drink water on the ground, and when they move between forest patches they move along the ground where their conspicuous colouration makes them vulnerable to predators and hunters.

Suitable forest habitat is diminishing as a result of land clearance for agriculture and livestock timber harvesting for charcoal and construction and small-scale mining for gemstones (4) and even within a so-called protected area where this species occurs an annual deforestation rate of 1.2 percent has been recorded (6). Whilst taboos against hunting once existed in many parts of Madagascar the increase in immigrants without belief in such taboos has led to a worrying growth in hunting (2). Such threats have already reduced this speciesâ?? population to perilously low levels - in 2003-2004 it was estimated there were only 915 individuals remaining â?? and continue to push Perrierâ??s sifaka towards extinction (6). Such a small population is at great risk of problems arising from loss of <strong>genetic variation</strong> making the long term viability of this species highly questionable (2) (6).,Analamerana Special Reserve harbours the majority of the Perrierâ??s sifaka population (1) although rather than offering the protection this rare species requires forest within the reserve is still being gradually destroyed (1) (6) and this species clearly requires further protection if it is going to survive. Since 2005 a group of interested parties led by the Monaco-based non-governmental organisation Act for Nature and the Groupe dâ??Etude et de Recherche sur les Primates de Madagascar have been conducting a conservation and research programme for Perrierâ??s sifaka. The programmeâ??s goals are to secure this speciesâ?? future in at least one major area currently without any degree of protection and to gain further scientific knowledge on this species that will help inform future conservation measures (7).

The majority of the land in the Karoo Desert is very unfertile but the riverine rabbit occupies the flood plains of the seasonal Karoo rivers and its tributaries which are fertile and have therefore been ploughed extensively in some areas. Removal of the natural vegetation along the rivers and streams prevents the rabbit from constructing stable breeding burrows due to the loss of the soft <strong>alluvial</strong> top soils and from feeding and escaping predation (1). Overgrazing by domestic herbivores also poses a threat to the rabbitsâ?? habitat and results in habitat degradation and fragmentation (2). As rabbits and hares are adding to the menu of farm workers they are shot or trapped with gin traps (1).,The Endangered Wildlife Trustâ??s Riverine Rabbit Working Group (EWT-RRWG) was established in August 2003 with the aim of establishing and conserving an ecosystem and socioeconomic conditions in the Karoo that can support a stable population of riverine rabbits. The EWT-RRWG achieves this through surveys research and monitoring environmental education and awareness habitat management and rehabilitation and conservation stewardship programmes. At present none of the riverine rabbit habitat is protected and the species only occurs on private Karoo farmland. Therefore the establishment of Riverine Rabbit Conservancies is an important aim for the EWT-RRWG. Conservancies are areas established by a voluntary agreement with private landowners who have riverine rabbits and potentially suitable habitat on their properties. So far three have been established in the Karoo. The conservation and management of riverine rabbit populations and their habitat is outlined in the conservancy constitution and landowners strictly control or prohibit any hunting with dogs and the use of gin traps (7). With the EWT-RRWG raising awareness of the riverine rabbitâ??s threatened status and coordinating conservation efforts it is hoped that the risk of extinction to this rare species can be reduced. ,loss;fragmentation; ,protected; ,2,1.0,yes,1

In Indonesia habitat destruction is a major problem as a result of illegal and commercial logging and large agricultural projects such as rubber and oil palm plantations (7).  Sumatra has a very high rate of habitat loss with some areas losing up to 65 percent of their forest cover in the last 25 years (8).Â Only 33.8 percent of Sumatra remains covered by <strong>primary forest</strong> and only 1.3 percent of this is upper montane vegetation in which <i>Nepenthes lavicola </i>is found.  The highly localised distribution of <i>Nepenthes lavicola</i> makes it particularly susceptible to the impacts of habitat disturbance or catastrophic environmental events such as drought or fire.  In addition highland plants such as <i>Nepenthes lavicola</i> take longer than lowland plants to recover from any disturbance as growth is slower (2).,<i>Nepenthes lavicola </i>is listed on Appendix II of the Convention of International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) which limits international trade in this species.  However this is very difficult to regulate.  Trade in <i>Nepenthes</i> species does not need to be identified down to species level and plants simply labelled as <i>Nepenthes </i>accounted for 94 percent of exported plants between 1988 and 1993.  This needs to be remedied and urgent attention is required to close other trade loopholes. Presently over-collection does not seem to pose an extensive threat for <i>Nepenthes lavicola</i> and artificial cultivation reduces this threat further (2).

This has been caused by introduced predatory fish primarily the smallmouth bass (<i>Micropterus dolomieu</i>) in addition to habitat degradation and fragmentation (2).  As the Olifants River region experiences hot dry summers water is extracted from the main river and its tributaries to irrigate the surrounding agricultural land.  Impoundments are also constructed to store water after the winter rainy season.  Furthermore river beds are bulldozed into wide channels to prevent the adjacent land from being flooded in the rainy season (2).  Such activities greatly alter the habitat of the sawfin and restrict its ability to move freely between different areas.,CapeNature a public institution responsible for biodiversity in the Western Cape (5) classifies the sawfin as endangered which makes it an offence to remove captured fish from rivers and dams.  CapeNature also undertakes regular surveys of the Olifants River system and has successfully cultured the sawfin since 1994.  Juveniles are then introduced to suitable natural habitats or stocked into farm dams to establish refuge populations.  Small parts of the sawfinâ??s range fall within protected areas including the Cedarberg Matjies River and Oorlogskloof Nature Reserves (2).

Today however the distribution of pine savannas dominated by the longleaf pine is less than three percent of its original extent. The dramatic decline in its distribution is attributable to over harvesting particularly during the 19th century as well as clearance for urban development agriculture and pine plantations (6). Furthermore the fragmentation and mismanagement of the remaining stands has resulted in the suppression of wildfires allowing non-fire tolerant hardwood species to outcompete the longleaf pine (2) (6) (8) (9). Consequently broadleaved hardwood forests in the region are now far more extensive than they were in pre-settlement times (9).,Considerable efforts are being made to restore longleaf pine across its natural range. Organisations such as the Longleaf Alliance are bringing together private landowners forest industries state and federal agencies conservation groups and researchers to determine the most appropriate means for revitalising this threatened ecosystem.

Rats and mongooses have also been suggested as potential threats (as invasive predators), although literature on this subject is equivocal (Hedges, 1993, and Thurley and Bell, 1994, support the notion that these introduced species comprise threats to amphibian species, while Reagan and Waide, 1996, suggest that rats are lesser predators of Eleutherodactylus coqui), and there is currently no consensus regarding the impact that these species may or may not have on amphibian declines in Puerto Rico. Future research efforts directed at investigating the impact of these invasive species on amphibian populations may help to elucidate their relative contribution to amphibian declines.

In addition many of the older trees are dying indicating that the population does not appear to be naturally regenerating (5) (7). The rarity of the bastard quiver tree may be partly attributed to their habitat; in harsh environments the problems of survival are amplified (5). Similar declines in population regeneration in sister species <i>Aloe dichotoma</i> (the quiver tree) have been attributed to climate change (8) and it is very likely that the bastard quiver tree is being affected similarly. These effects are worsened by the removal of plants by horticultural collectors as well as through herbivory by baboon porcupines rock rabbits and livestock which also trample young plants (4) (5) (7). Populations may also be affected by damage caused by leaf scale insects and by base metal mining in Namibia (9).,Bastard quiver trees are protected in South Africa and Namibia (10) and are listed on Appendix I of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) effectively banning international trade in wild plants of this species (1).

Therefore although it still survives in shaded plantations and sugarcane fields any clearance of these to create more open drier habitats would have a negative impact on this species (1). Similarly climate change may also pose a threat and already appears to be causing dramatic declines in other Central American salamanders (12).

One small population is likely to be lost within the next 25 years as mining activity is planned in part of Sainte Luce while many other populations are under continual threat from local communities exploiting the forestâ??s resources (1). Indeed the day gecko is suspected to have become extinct in Petriky Forest due to tree felling for timber fuel and conversion to agricultural land (2). This highly specialised species is also threatened by the selective removal of <em>Pandus</em> trees (1). ,The Ambatotsirongorongo Forest which supports a large proportion of the remaining day gecko population is encompassed by a newly created protected area. Five forest fragments at Sainte Luce in which the day gecko is also found are also managed within a community resource use agreement which aims to protect the local peopleâ??s livelihoods whilst conserving biodiversity (1).

The principle agent behind this decline was the creation of Greers Ferry Lake in 1962 which resulted in the inundation of downstream tributaries creating deep pools with increased sedimentation and lower oxygen levels in the water. As an inhabitant of shallow fast-moving streams the yellowcheek darter was displaced from much of its former range moving upstream to less suitable areas of habitat. The speciesâ?? migratory behaviour was also disrupted while the loss of downstream refugia made the species more vulnerable to droughts resulting in the loss of many populations (7). Other threats such as the channelization of streams for agriculture and human consumption have isolated some populations and a loss of <strong>genetic diversity</strong> has been observed due to <strong>inbreeding</strong> (3) (8).,Having suffered such a severe decline the yellowcheek darter is in drastic need of major conservation measures. Indeed the species has been proposed for Threatened Status under the U.S Endangered Species Act (9). An agreement has also been made between several conservation organisations and landowners to mitigate threats to the species protect bordering terrestrial habitats; and explore potential reintroduction programmes (3).

Hurricane-force winds have recently scoured the Na Pali sea cliffs killing many plants (7). Additionally while most populations are found on virtually inaccessibly sea-cliffs the Waiahuakua population on Kauaâ??i is more accessible and has suffered damage from the activities of feral goats (6). In the early 1990s Kauaâ??i had a total of approximately 150 individuals on the Na Pali sea cliffs where today there remain only seven (7). With such critically low numbers there is a concern that genetic variability will get too low as a result of inbreeding between remaining plants for the species to adequately respond to environmental pressures (7) (3). Thus although once fairly common this species is now teetering on the brink of extinction in the wild (8).,Botanists and horticulturists concerned about the plight of Hawaiiâ??s threatened plant species have helped save this fantastic plant from total extinction by pollinating the remaining wild specimens by hand and collecting seeds for propagation (8). Successful germination of the seeds has enabled large numbers of plants to be grown in botanical gardens to be used in a replanting programme (8). Today there are more plants in the Limahuli Gardens and McBride Gardens on Kauaâ??i than there are in the wild (5)! Endangered species may benefit from increased artificial gene flow especially if they have passed through a genetic bottleneck due to <strong>inbreeding depression</strong> and hand pollination experiments have aided in this respect (7).

    Hunting for the purposes of traditional ""medicine"" is the primary threat facing this species; most of the populations that survive are heavily reduced and fragmented. Only the subpopulation at Van Long, with about 50 individuals, is thought likely to survive given the current hunting pressure; however, quarrying for limestone (cement), which is currently taking place there, has affected the ranging behaviour of the animals (T. Nadler pers. comm.). The smallest groups are extremely unlikely to survive should the one reproductively active male be taken or killed (Nadler 2004). Forest loss is a more minor threat as it occurs in degraded areas. A potential threat is the rapid development of tourist facilities adjacent to protected areas, especially around Van Long and Hoa Lu Nature Reserves.

Van Long Nature Reserve was established for this species in 2001, and there has been some evidence of population growth in this reserve in the past five years. The connection of forest fragments in some already protected areas, such as Van Long, could greatly increase the size and survivability of some subpopulations. Also considered as beneficial population management for this species are the translocation of severely threatened (small) groups to safe and suitable habitat, and the augmentation of existing groups with offspring from a captive population. Delacour's langurs have been successfully kept and bred in captivity at the Endangered Primate Rescue Center in Cuc Phuong National Park, Viet Nam, which is currently the only collection keeping this species (Nadler 2004).

Deforestation as a result of agricultural industrial and residential development has led to habitat loss and fragmentation and the consequent isolation of subpopulations which impedes out-breeding and genetic diversity. From 1956 to 1993 Sri Lanka lost more than 50 percent of its forests to human activities followed by a similar rate of decline between 1994 and 2003. This species has also suffered from hunting and illegal trade of its meat and skin with the skin used to make drums in some areas. The purple-faced langur is hunted mainly for subsistence living and trade at local village level. According to continuing trends populations of this species are predicted to decline by more than 50 percent within the next 11 to 22 years (1).,The commercial exploitation of purple-faced langurs is regulated by their listing on Appendix II of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) (3). All four <strong>subspecies</strong> are also protected under the Flora and Fauna Protection Ordinance 1993 and exist in a number of protected areas (1). However the issue of habitat loss still places these <strong>subspecies</strong> classified as Endangered and Critically Endangered at serious risk of extinction (1). Indeed the Critically Endangered western purple-faced langur (<i>T. v. nestor</i>) was officially recognised in 2004 as one of the worldâ??s 25 most endangered primates. This <strong>subspecies</strong> requires good canopy cover but possibly fewer than three forests currently exist within Sri Lanka that can support viable populations and none of these are within protected areas. Furthermore the human-modified areas that support much of the langur population such as gardens and rubber plantations are under private ownership and therefore unstable changing rapidly due to human population expansion and development. Censuses are therefore urgently needed to identify forest areas suitable for conservation. Further studies are also essential to better understand the decline of sub-populations in both space and time in the extremely disturbed habitats where these langurs survive today (6). ,loss;fragmentation;hunting; ,cites;protected; ,3,2.0,yes,0

The wood is considered enormously valuable being very fragrant and resistant to termites borers and fungal disease. It is used locally for making carvings boxes and furniture sold to tourists and is also sold abroad for light construction and flooring. The timber is thought to be particularly good for boat-building to the point that fishery officials have urged that remaining supplies be reserved for the Lake Malawi fishing industry. The Forestry Department of Malawi have recently agreed to supply Mulanje Cedar to build 450 boats for this purpose (11). The treeâ??s decline has been somewhat stemmed by a ban on felling allowing exploitation only of dead trees but illegal felling and killing of trees continues at an alarming rate. The Mulanje Mountain Forest Reserve is also generally threatened by encroachment and large-scale development such as the continual threat of bauxite mining. Additionally there is concern that mature individuals appear to be dying at a high rate thought possibly to be due to their high sensitivity to forest fires and susceptibility to attacks by a species of aphid (3). Regeneration on the other hand seems to depend on fire and is extremely poor. In addition <i>Pinus patula</i> (originally a commercial plantation species) has invaded a number of areas suitable for <i>Widdringtonia</i> colonisation (5) (9). All these threats have greatly impacted the Mulanje cedar; a 2007 study found that the remaining Mulanje cedar forests had been reduced by 40 percent over the previous 15 years (3). Out of the remaining 845.3 hectares of forest identified over 32 percent of standing Mulanje cedar was found to be dead (3). As so much dead wood is available for utilisation there should be no reason to cut live Mulanje cedar (3).,All Mulanje cedars are protected within the Mulanje Mountain Forest Reserve and licences are available now only for the exploitation of dead trees from the Forestry Department of Malawi (3) (9). The Mulanje Mountain Conservation Trust has also been set up to provide long-term support for the research and conservation of biological diversity in the Mulanje Mountain Forest Reserve and the sustainable utilisation of its natural resources. The Trust is working with the Forestry Department of Malawi in bringing in community participation to manage the resources of the forest reserve and maximise the benefits among resource users (12).

    This species is threatened by non-targeted hunting (Bleisch 1991) and habitat loss due to forest clearing (Bleisch 1995). It is also sometimes caught in snares set for other animals (Bleisch 1995). Previously, collection of magnolia flower buds and bark (by cutting down tress) by local villagers removed a food source of this species, but this practice has reportedly ceased (Dunyan pers. comm. 2006). There is currently construction and development for tourism, including a tourist road, cable car and hotels within the nature reserve, which are a potential threat because of habitat destruction and disturbance. At lower elevations, there is continued pressure from agricultural expansion and collection of firewood. The species occurs at only a single locality, making it vulnerable to epidemic disease or catastrophes.

The human population in this remote corner of China has exploded in recent decades and forests are being cleared both for timber and to make way for agriculture (5). The populations of snub-nosed monkeys that remain are isolated in fragments of the former forest (8). Hunting of this primate was banned in China in 1975 but lack of funds and staff means that this law is hard to enforce and hunting persists (2). Monkeys are also accidentally trapped in snares set out for other wildlife (6).,The Government of China banned the hunting of snub-nosed monkeys in 1975 although this has proven difficult to enforce (2). Around half the population of the Yunnan snub-nosed monkey occurs within protected reserves such as Baima Snow Mountain Nature Reserve where wardens are trying to work closely with the local people to secure the future of this species (5). In 1998 a national logging ban on all remaining old-growth forests came into force which will help to preserve some of the monkey's precious habitat (5).

Currently those threats come in the form of habitat degradation and hunting. As tourism on the island of Utila increases the mangrove forest habitat of the spiny-tailed iguana is being cleared for the construction of houses and marinas and used as a garbage dump site (1). Beaches are also being affected with some beaches being sold for the development of houses hotels and road construction and other beach areas becoming covered with introduced invasive plants creating a habitat unsuitable for egg-laying (1). In addition despite being protected by Honduran law this rare reptile is still hunted locally for its meat (1).,Tremendous conservation efforts have been initiated for the Utila spiny-tailed iguana in an attempt to prevent its extinction. In 1994 the Frankfurt Zoological Society and the Senckenberg Nature Research Society together initiated work to preserve the Utila spiny-tailed iguana.

In addition many of the older trees are dying indicating that the population does not appear to be naturally regenerating (5) (7). The rarity of the bastard quiver tree may be partly attributed to their habitat; in harsh environments the problems of survival are amplified (5). Similar declines in population regeneration in sister species <i>Aloe dichotoma</i> (the quiver tree) have been attributed to climate change (8) and it is very likely that the bastard quiver tree is being affected similarly. These effects are worsened by the removal of plants by horticultural collectors as well as through herbivory by baboon porcupines rock rabbits and livestock which also trample young plants (4) (5) (7). Populations may also be affected by damage caused by leaf scale insects and by base metal mining in Namibia (9).,Bastard quiver trees are protected in South Africa and Namibia (10) and are listed on Appendix I of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) effectively banning international trade in wild plants of this species (1).

Unfortunately like many other species of mussel the Cumberland bean pearly mussel is under threat due to human activities namely siltation channelization and water pollution such as from toxic chemical spills and run-off from urban and agricultural areas (8). Being a filter feeder the Cumberland bean pearly mussel must have exceptionally clean water to feed reproduce and respire thus any pollution or siltation seriously jeopardises the musselâ??s chance of survival as the water becomes dirty or poisonous. In addition channelization destroys suitable river habitats changing the dynamics of the water downstream so that it is no longer suitable for the mussel (2). Population numbers are hard to estimate as little data are available; however it is thought that there are around 1000 to 2000 individuals left in the wild meaning that this species has suffered a decline of around 75 to 90 percent since it was first discovered (4).,This species was first listed as Endangered by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service in June 1976 and a conservation plan was approved in August 1984. The aims of the recovery plan are to re-establish the Cumberland bean pearly mussel within two river systems that were formerly part of its range and to prevent the loss or degradation of existing habitats (4) (8). It is essential for more research to be carried out on the life history of this mysterious mussel including studies to identify the host fish species of the <strong>larvae</strong> to understand how to rear the species in a laboratory to aid with reintroduction and to identify potential habitats for reintroduction (4). ,pollution; , ,1,0.0,yes,0

This has been caused by introduced predatory fish primarily the smallmouth bass (<i>Micropterus dolomieu</i>) in addition to habitat degradation and fragmentation (2).  As the Olifants River region experiences hot dry summers water is extracted from the main river and its tributaries to irrigate the surrounding agricultural land.  Impoundments are also constructed to store water after the winter rainy season.  Furthermore river beds are bulldozed into wide channels to prevent the adjacent land from being flooded in the rainy season (2).  Such activities greatly alter the habitat of the sawfin and restrict its ability to move freely between different areas.,CapeNature a public institution responsible for biodiversity in the Western Cape (5) classifies the sawfin as endangered which makes it an offence to remove captured fish from rivers and dams.  CapeNature also undertakes regular surveys of the Olifants River system and has successfully cultured the sawfin since 1994.  Juveniles are then introduced to suitable natural habitats or stocked into farm dams to establish refuge populations.  Small parts of the sawfinâ??s range fall within protected areas including the Cedarberg Matjies River and Oorlogskloof Nature Reserves (2).

In addition part of the <em>E. whitelockii</em> population occurs within the boundary of the Queen Elizabeth National Park although the integrity of some of Ugandaâ?? protected areas is a moot point (4). Owing to the increased pressure on <em>E. whitelockii</em> a local community-based conservation project is fortunately being implemented in the region. The project is aiming to raise community awareness on the conservation and importance of the species as well as to create a seed bank and nursery. The propagation of <em>E. whitelockii</em> in a nursery will provide plants for replanting in the wild to bolster the population (10). With the population under as serious threat as it is projects like this may be critical to this species survival. , ,cites;protected; ,0,2.0,yes,0

In Indonesia habitat destruction is a major problem as a result of illegal and commercial logging and large agricultural projects such as rubber and oil palm plantations (7).  Sumatra has a very high rate of habitat loss with some areas losing up to 65 percent of their forest cover in the last 25 years (8).Â Only 33.8 percent of Sumatra remains covered by <strong>primary forest</strong> and only 1.3 percent of this is upper montane vegetation in which <i>Nepenthes lavicola </i>is found.  The highly localised distribution of <i>Nepenthes lavicola</i> makes it particularly susceptible to the impacts of habitat disturbance or catastrophic environmental events such as drought or fire.  In addition highland plants such as <i>Nepenthes lavicola</i> take longer than lowland plants to recover from any disturbance as growth is slower (2).,<i>Nepenthes lavicola </i>is listed on Appendix II of the Convention of International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) which limits international trade in this species.  However this is very difficult to regulate.  Trade in <i>Nepenthes</i> species does not need to be identified down to species level and plants simply labelled as <i>Nepenthes </i>accounted for 94 percent of exported plants between 1988 and 1993.  This needs to be remedied and urgent attention is required to close other trade loopholes. Presently over-collection does not seem to pose an extensive threat for <i>Nepenthes lavicola</i> and artificial cultivation reduces this threat further (2).

Therefore although it still survives in shaded plantations and sugarcane fields any clearance of these to create more open drier habitats would have a negative impact on this species (1). Similarly climate change may also pose a threat and already appears to be causing dramatic declines in other Central American salamanders (12).

    Hunting for the purposes of traditional ""medicine"" is the primary threat facing this species; most of the populations that survive are heavily reduced and fragmented. Only the subpopulation at Van Long, with about 50 individuals, is thought likely to survive given the current hunting pressure; however, quarrying for limestone (cement), which is currently taking place there, has affected the ranging behaviour of the animals (T. Nadler pers. comm.). The smallest groups are extremely unlikely to survive should the one reproductively active male be taken or killed (Nadler 2004). Forest loss is a more minor threat as it occurs in degraded areas. A potential threat is the rapid development of tourist facilities adjacent to protected areas, especially around Van Long and Hoa Lu Nature Reserves.

    
  ","[""\n    This species is currently listed only as CITES Appendix II. It is considered 'endangered' in Viet Nam, and is listed as a 'most endangered' species under Annex 1B of Decree 32 (2006). It occurs in six protected areas, but many still experience high hunting pressure. Van Long Nature Reserve was established for this species in 2001, and there has been some evidence of population growth in this reserve in the past five years. The connection of forest fragments in some already protected areas, such as Van Long, could greatly increase the size and survivability of some subpopulations. Also considered as beneficial population management for this species are the translocation of severely threatened (small) groups to safe and suitable habitat, and the augmentation of existing groups with offspring from a captive population. Delacour's langurs have been successfully kept and bred in captivity at the Endangered Primate Rescue Center in Cuc Phuong National Park, Viet Nam, which is currently the only collection keeping this species (Nadler 2004). It is necessary to ensure the sustainability of these programs.

During the 1990s when Vietnam opened itself up to the international community and the Chinese economy started to boom traders and poachers moved in to utilise Vietnamâ??s biodiversity (4). Poachers killed this langur not only for meat but also for bones organs and tissues that are used in traditional medicines (8). Hunting has reduced in recent years with increasing legal protection but continues to pose a significant threat. Habitat loss is also a danger to this species with the World Conservation Monitoring Centre of the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP-WCMC) estimating that a total of 30000 hectares of forest are destroyed each year in Vietnam (4). The clearing of forests to accommodate human commercial and residential growth continues to separate the remaining populations of Delacourâ??s langur which are now at risk of becoming too small to be viably sustainable (2). Sixty percent of Delacourâ??s langurs occur in isolated populations of fewer than 20 individuals. The loss of these sub-populations and consequently 60 percent of the whole population is feared likely in the near future without management strict regulations and law enforcement (5).,Four areas where Delacourâ??s langurs are protected include: Cuc Phuong National Park Pu Luong Nature Reserve Hoa Lu Cultural and Historical Site and the recently-established Van Long Nature Reserve which is believed to contain the largest remaining population of around 70 individuals (5) (8). Unfortunately protected areas often suffer more from poaching than unprotected areas because their dense population of wildlife is seen as more profitable (2). Thus conservation groups are working to increase the level of protection and law enforcement within these protected areas. The Van Long Nature Reserve is now well guarded by rangers largely funded by the Frankfurt Zoological Society. The Pu Luong Nature Reserve also employs a large number of rangers which are helping to save the small remaining populations (8). These are encouraging steps towards helping the survival of Delacourâ??s langur listed as one of the 25 most endangered primates in the world (8). Recent commitments by the Vietnamese government and several international conservation organisations to do more to protect Delacourâ??s langur have greatly increased the chances of saving this rare and remarkable species (2). ,loss;hunting;environment; ,protected; ,3,1.0,yes,1

This has been caused by introduced predatory fish primarily the smallmouth bass (<i>Micropterus dolomieu</i>) in addition to habitat degradation and fragmentation (2).  As the Olifants River region experiences hot dry summers water is extracted from the main river and its tributaries to irrigate the surrounding agricultural land.  Impoundments are also constructed to store water after the winter rainy season.  Furthermore river beds are bulldozed into wide channels to prevent the adjacent land from being flooded in the rainy season (2).  Such activities greatly alter the habitat of the sawfin and restrict its ability to move freely between different areas.,CapeNature a public institution responsible for biodiversity in the Western Cape (5) classifies the sawfin as endangered which makes it an offence to remove captured fish from rivers and dams.  CapeNature also undertakes regular surveys of the Olifants River system and has successfully cultured the sawfin since 1994.  Juveniles are then introduced to suitable natural habitats or stocked into farm dams to establish refuge populations.  Small parts of the sawfinâ??s range fall within protected areas including the Cedarberg Matjies River and Oorlogskloof Nature Reserves (2).  However to ensure the sawfinâ??s future it is vital to protect the habitat in the specific tributaries and the small section of the Olifants River mainstream where the sawfin remains abundant.

This has been caused by introduced predatory fish primarily the smallmouth bass (<i>Micropterus dolomieu</i>) in addition to habitat degradation and fragmentation (2).  As the Olifants River region experiences hot dry summers water is extracted from the main river and its tributaries to irrigate the surrounding agricultural land.  Impoundments are also constructed to store water after the winter rainy season.  Furthermore river beds are bulldozed into wide channels to prevent the adjacent land from being flooded in the rainy season (2).  Such activities greatly alter the habitat of the sawfin and restrict its ability to move freely between different areas.,CapeNature a public institution responsible for biodiversity in the Western Cape (5) classifies the sawfin as endangered which makes it an offence to remove captured fish from rivers and dams.  CapeNature also undertakes regular surveys of the Olifants River system and has successfully cultured the sawfin since 1994.  Juveniles are then introduced to suitable natural habitats or stocked into farm dams to establish refuge populations.  Small parts of the sawfinâ??s range fall within protected areas including the Cedarberg Matjies River and Oorlogskloof Nature Reserves (2).  However to ensure the sawfinâ??s future it is vital to protect the habitat in the specific tributaries and the small section of the Olifants River mainstream where the sawfin remains abundant.  In addition efforts to prevent further introductions of alien predatory fish species are imperative (2). ,fragmentation; ,protected; ,1,1.0,yes,0

    Areas on Anegada that once contained dense populations of iguanas now support few or none.  Research indicates that this is due to three major causes, including competitive grazing pressure from free-ranging livestock, predation by feral dogs, and predation of juveniles by feral cats.Â Competition with livestock for food is the principal reason, although predation, habitat loss and a multiple year drought are also having a negative impact.

In the absence of introduced predators, however, the iguanas appear to do well and reproduce in areas that are free of sheep (the only feral grazing competitor present).  Currently, approximately 20 adult iguanas are estimated to inhabit Guana.  Offspring have been seen each year since 1987, but recruitment is very low over much of the island.

Sadly the speciesâ?? large size deems it an easy target for hunters while its slow reproductive rate and generally low population densities makes it especially vulnerable to population collapses as a result of over-hunting (4). The habitat of the hybrid spider monkey (<i>A. h. hybridus</i>) is patchily distributed and there is a concern that few populations remain that are of an adequate size to be viable in the mid to long term. Populations are failing to be actively managed even within protected areas. However the brown spider monkey (<i>A. h. brunneus</i>) does not occur in any protected area and its population size is thought to be much smaller than that of the nominate subspecies (1). The brown spider monkey (<i>A. h. brunneus</i>) has a small geographic range where forest loss degradation and fragmentation are unfortunately widespread. Thus this subspecies has been officially recognised in 2004 and 2006 as one of the worldâ??s 25 most endangered primates (4).,The hybrid spider monkey (<i>A. h. hybridus</i>) is known to occur in 4 protected areas: Catatumbo-BarÃ­ El Cocuy National Park and TamÃ¡ National Park in Colombia and Guatopo National Park in Venezuela (2). Although not in any protected areas a refuge remains for the brown spider monkey (<i>A. h. brunneus</i>) in the SerranÃ­a de San Lucas in southern BolÃ­var which has been identified as an important site for the potential establishment of a national park. A park in the SerranÃ­a San Lucas would protect a number of species <strong>endemic</strong> to the region including two other threatened primate species the white-footed tamarin (<i>Saguinus leucopus</i>) and woolly monkey (<i>Lagothrix lagothricha lugens</i>). However the region has been a centre of civil unrest for years and census work there would be hazardous since guerilla groups have placed anti-personnel mines in some parts of the mountain range. Although limiting opportunities for surveys and conservation work this civil unrest has proved to be a double-edged sword since it is also probably the reason why forest is still remaining considering the insatiable destruction of the forests elsewhere across the country (4). ,loss;fragmentation;hunting; ,protected; ,3,1.0,yes,0

Additional threats include fires set to increase livestock pasture, the cutting of trees to produce charcoal, forest destruction caused by itinerant miners, and hunting. During the dry season, they drink water on the ground, and when they move between forest patches they move along the ground where their conspicuous colouration makes them vulnerable to predators and hunters.

In the Philippines large areas of forest had already been cleared by the end of the nineteenth century for agricultural expansion which continued throughout the twentieth century (7). However the most extensive and rapid deforestation in the latter half of the century has been caused by commercial logging with has particularly impacted the valuable primary lowland dipterocarp forests which shrunk from an estimated 10 million hectares in the 1950s to only one million by the late 1980s (7). Forest clearance and habitat degradation throughout Borneo and the Philippines may also be having a detrimental effect on the treeâ??s natural pollinators reducing the rate at which the species can reproduce and recover its populations (4).,This threatened species is located in a proposed reserve site (1) which if awarded official reserve status in the future would confer some degree of protection to the species. The Philippinesâ?? Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR) has also established a <strong>genebank</strong> of economically useful <strong>endemic</strong> and endangered forest tree species including white seraya (8). This project has involved collecting and propagating the species to be maintained in an arboretum and gathering data on growth and survival of the species planted (8). A large scale project has also been initiated in Sabah Malaysia to rehabilitate 25000 hectares of logged forests using indigenous tree species such as dipterocarps in order to counteract atmospheric carbon dioxide (9). <i>Parashorea malaanonan</i> has been one of the main dipterocarp species planted to date (9). Indeed although such conservation efforts are not directed specifically at white seraya the tree is likely to benefit indirectly from a variety of such efforts to conserve lowland forests generally. Whether for environmental concerns or to protect the host of endangered species that inhabit lowland forests across Borneo and the Philippines conservation of such forests will undoubtedly help preserve this enormous tree which needs to be recognised for its crucial ecological importance as much as for its economic value. , , ,0,0.0,yes,0

This has been caused by introduced predatory fish primarily the smallmouth bass (<i>Micropterus dolomieu</i>) in addition to habitat degradation and fragmentation (2).  As the Olifants River region experiences hot dry summers water is extracted from the main river and its tributaries to irrigate the surrounding agricultural land.  Impoundments are also constructed to store water after the winter rainy season.  Furthermore river beds are bulldozed into wide channels to prevent the adjacent land from being flooded in the rainy season (2).  Such activities greatly alter the habitat of the sawfin and restrict its ability to move freely between different areas.,CapeNature a public institution responsible for biodiversity in the Western Cape (5) classifies the sawfin as endangered which makes it an offence to remove captured fish from rivers and dams.  CapeNature also undertakes regular surveys of the Olifants River system and has successfully cultured the sawfin since 1994.  Juveniles are then introduced to suitable natural habitats or stocked into farm dams to establish refuge populations.  Small parts of the sawfinâ??s range fall within protected areas including the Cedarberg Matjies River and Oorlogskloof Nature Reserves (2).  However to ensure the sawfinâ??s future it is vital to protect the habitat in the specific tributaries and the small section of the Olifants River mainstream where the sawfin remains abundant.

Only the subpopulation at Van Long, with about 50 individuals, is thought likely to survive given the current hunting pressure; however, quarrying for limestone (cement), which is currently taking place there, has affected the ranging behaviour of the animals (T. Nadler pers. comm.). The smallest groups are extremely unlikely to survive should the one reproductively active male be taken or killed (Nadler 2004).

A potential threat is the rapid development of tourist facilities adjacent to protected areas, especially around Van Long and Hoa Lu Nature Reserves.

It occurs in six protected areas, but many still experience high hunting pressure. Van Long Nature Reserve was established for this species in 2001, and there has been some evidence of population growth in this reserve in the past five years. The connection of forest fragments in some already protected areas, such as Van Long, could greatly increase the size and survivability of some subpopulations. Also considered as beneficial population management for this species are the translocation of severely threatened (small) groups to safe and suitable habitat, and the augmentation of existing groups with offspring from a captive population. Delacour's langurs have been successfully kept and bred in captivity at the Endangered Primate Rescue Center in Cuc Phuong National Park, Viet Nam, which is currently the only collection keeping this species (Nadler 2004).

Deforestation as a result of agricultural industrial and residential development has led to habitat loss and fragmentation and the consequent isolation of subpopulations which impedes out-breeding and genetic diversity. From 1956 to 1993 Sri Lanka lost more than 50 percent of its forests to human activities followed by a similar rate of decline between 1994 and 2003. This species has also suffered from hunting and illegal trade of its meat and skin with the skin used to make drums in some areas. The purple-faced langur is hunted mainly for subsistence living and trade at local village level. According to continuing trends populations of this species are predicted to decline by more than 50 percent within the next 11 to 22 years (1).,The commercial exploitation of purple-faced langurs is regulated by their listing on Appendix II of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) (3). All four <strong>subspecies</strong> are also protected under the Flora and Fauna Protection Ordinance 1993 and exist in a number of protected areas (1). However the issue of habitat loss still places these <strong>subspecies</strong> classified as Endangered and Critically Endangered at serious risk of extinction (1). Indeed the Critically Endangered western purple-faced langur (<i>T. v. nestor</i>) was officially recognised in 2004 as one of the worldâ??s 25 most endangered primates. This <strong>subspecies</strong> requires good canopy cover but possibly fewer than three forests currently exist within Sri Lanka that can support viable populations and none of these are within protected areas. Furthermore the human-modified areas that support much of the langur population such as gardens and rubber plantations are under private ownership and therefore unstable changing rapidly due to human population expansion and development. Censuses are therefore urgently needed to identify forest areas suitable for conservation. Further studies are also essential to better understand the decline of sub-populations in both space and time in the extremely disturbed habitats where these langurs survive today (6). ,loss;fragmentation;hunting; ,cites;protected; ,3,2.0,yes,0

Since lungless salamanders need a damp environment to maintain the moist skin on which oxygen uptake depends (4) any alteration in moisture conditions poses a severe threat. Therefore although it still survives in shaded plantations and sugarcane fields any clearance of these to create more open drier habitats would have a negative impact on this species (1). Similarly climate change may also pose a threat and already appears to be causing dramatic declines in other Central American salamanders (12). Although there is not yet any direct evidence that the fungal disease chytridiomycosis has contributed to these declines its role in the decline of many other amphibian species suggests that it may also be a potential threat (12).,No specific conservation measures are currently known to be in place for Salvinâ??s mushroomtongue salamander but the maintenance of shaded habitats has been identified as being important to its long-term survival (1).

Habitat degradation and conversion to developments for tourism human settlements and road construction are particularly severe problems while predation from introduced mammals such as rats and mongoose also threatens many native species (6). As a result of these threats the range of the Virgin Islands coqui has become highly fragmented and there is an ongoing decline in the quality of its habitat. The small distinct population on Great Dog is particularly vulnerable. The Virgin Islands coqui also appears to be declining with the spread of the predatory Cuban tree frog (<em>Osteopilus septentrionalis</em>) (1).<em>  </em>,A number of conservation recommendations have been made to protect the native fauna of the British Virgin Islands including the creation of protected areas and minimising the impacts of development through the better enforcement of protective legislation. Increased monitoring efforts for amphibian populations may also be required given the potential for deadly diseases such as the fungus chytridiomycosis to break out on the island especially as disease has been associated with dramatic amphibian declines on nearby islands (6).

Although unproven it is thought that the introduction of the northern Pacific seastar (<i>Asterias amurensis</i>) to Tasmania at this time may be the key to the decimation of the handfish population (3). These seastars are voracious predators of shellfish and it is thought that they may also eat the eggs of handfish or the sea squirts upon which the eggs are attached (2). The deterioration of coastal habitats due to development may also be involved in the decline (3). This species is under added threat from its vastly reduced population limited dispersal restricted distribution and low reproductive rate (3).,Just two spotted handfish were reported between 1990 and 1994; this dire state of the population led to the formation of the Spotted Handfish Recovery Team in 1996 (3). The Recovery Team consists of a number of government agencies concerned with saving this rare and bizarre fish. Research into existing wild populations and the development of captive breeding techniques are some of the priorities of the recovery plan (3).

During <strong>hibernation</strong> the Indiana bat is vulnerable to human disturbance which can cause direct mortality or cause them to rouse and deplete their important energy reserves.  Disturbance can be in the form of researchers vandalism and the commercialization of caves allowing tourists to visit caves.  Modifications to mines and caves such as the construction of gates to restrict human access alter airflow temperature and humidity to which the Indiana bat is very sensitive; or gates may not allow sufficient flight space for the bats and thus block them from a critical <strong>hibernation</strong> site (2) (3).  As Indiana bats <strong>hibernate</strong> in very large numbers in only a few caves this makes them particularly vulnerable to disturbance and natural disasters as a large proportion of the total population can be affected by a single event (3).,As well as being classified as Endangered on the IUCN Red List 2007 (1) the Indiana bat is also listed as Endangered under the Endangered Species Act of 1973.  As an outcome of this the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service has drawn up a recovery plan with the goal of improving the status of the Indiana bat so that it can be removed from the Endangered Species List (3).  To reach the goal a number of actions are required; conserving and managing the hibernacula and the summer habitat conducting further essential research and implementing a public information and outreach program.  Dependent on funding and the implementation of conservation actions it has been estimated that the species can fully recover by the year 2027 (3).  At present the primary conservation effort has been to control human access of caves by erecting properly designed gates that keep people from disturbing hibernating bats while maintaining temperature humidity and allowing access for bats (3). ,loss; ,endangered species act; ,1,1.0,yes,0

The main threat to this species is thought to be habitat loss which is occurring due to excessive groundwater pumping for agriculture (1). The Comanche Spring pupfish has become locally extinct in the spring where it was discovered due to groundwater extraction (1) and excessive water removal is still a problem in the area as much more water being removed than being replaced by rainfall (3). Other threats to this species include competition and <strong>hybridisation</strong> with non-native species such as the sheepshead minnow (<em>Cyprinodon variegatus</em>) (14). An especially large population of this <strong>invasive</strong> fish lives in Lake Balmorhea and the upstream dispersal of this population is proving to be detrimental to the Comanche Springs pupfish (15).,Current conservation efforts for this species are focussed on moderating water level fluctuations and removing <strong>invasive</strong> species (1). A man-made refugium and cienega were constructed in Balmorhea State Park in 1996 in an attempt to provide the Comanche Springs pupfish with a habitat that is not at risk of being drained (15). This wetland area has been located within the boundaries of the natural cienega in an effort to make it resemble and function similarly to the original habitat of this species (16). This conservation measure has proved to be a success and the area is now home to the worldâ??s largest Comanche Springs pupfish population.

In addition to causing widespread deforestation mining activities have also resulted in large waste heaps and increased erosion (1) (2) (6) (7) (9). Further threats to the native vegetation include human-generated wildfires which are often started deliberately to clear brush as well as agriculture livestock grazing and the spread of invasive exotic species (6) (7) (8) (9) (10).,New Caledonia is considered a biodiversity â??hotspotâ?? having for its size a remarkably unique and diverse flora and fauna (8) (9) (10).

    These animals are hunted for food and traditional â??medicine,â?? sometimes as illegal exports to China. Habitat loss for agriculture and wood extraction is also a major threat. A large length of the Chindwin (where the species was discovered) and its adjacent plains are scheduled to be inundated by the Tazone hydro-electric power dam. As well as direct loss of habitat through inundation this will result in massive increases in hunting as the construction labourers will be expected to live off the land, and the reservoir formed will greatly increase accessibility to a huge area of foothill forest; without specific, directed, management, hunters will no doubt take advantage of this. A very large area of suitable habitat falls within the proposed Hukaung Tiger Reserve, but it is unclear whether this area supports morphologically typical animals. If they do not occur in Hukaung, habitat loss is a sever threat to the species, because most other protected areas in the Myanmar part of its range are highland, and habitat below 900 m is heavily degraded and fragmented, and such processes are ongoing.

The focus of conservation efforts must fall primarily on the Cat Ba Island <strong>subspecies</strong> with possibly as few as 59 individuals remaining today. This shockingly low number is the result of a massive 98% decline over the course of 40 years from between 2500 and 2800 individuals in the 1960s to just 53 in 2000. Such a dangerously small population of Cat Ba langurs gives the impression that the Chinese <strong>subspecies</strong> <i>Trachypithecus poliocephalus leucocephalus</i> is thriving with between 600 and 800 individuals alive today. This is of course far from the truth particularly as declines were recorded in the populations at Longgang National Nature Reserve and the Fusui Rare and Precious Animal Reserve in 1998 (5).,With just 53 Cat Ba langurs in the wild and two in captivity at the Endangered Primate Rescue Centre of Cuc Phuong National Park the Cat Ba Langur Conservation Project was started in 2000 by MÅ±nster Zoo and the Zoological Society for the Conservation of Species and Populations (ZGAP). Given the cause of the langurâ??s decline the main aim of the project was to halt poaching with the additional intention of promoting conservation awareness amongst the inhabitants of Cat Ba Island. The project has been extremely successful in dramatically reducing deaths as a result of poaching bringing the number from 30 deaths in the eight months prior to its start to three deaths in the first four years of the project. In this time nine langurs were born and have survived. The langurs are closely monitored and protection measures are in place particularly in the newly created langur sanctuary within the National Park. This highly protected area is home to 20 individuals from a large reproducing group which are protected by a rotation of 20 rangers â?? an incredible ratio of one ranger to one langur. The sanctuary is visibly marked around its circumference and is inaccessible to tourists. The Cat Ba Langur Conservation Project has constructed two new ranger stations provided boats to ease patrols and has even seen the voluntary relocation of several local floating households to support the rangers (3). The Cat Ba langur also has the support of Flora and Fauna Internationalâ??s Flagship Species Fund (5) and the Cat Hai District Womenâ??s Union who implemented a project entitled â??Contributing to Biodiversity Conservation in Cat Ba National Park through Community Activityâ??

Habitat degradation and conversion to developments for tourism human settlements and road construction are particularly severe problems while predation from introduced mammals such as rats and mongoose also threatens many native species (6). As a result of these threats the range of the Virgin Islands coqui has become highly fragmented and there is an ongoing decline in the quality of its habitat. The small distinct population on Great Dog is particularly vulnerable. The Virgin Islands coqui also appears to be declining with the spread of the predatory Cuban tree frog (<em>Osteopilus septentrionalis</em>) (1).<em>  </em>,A number of conservation recommendations have been made to protect the native fauna of the British Virgin Islands including the creation of protected areas and minimising the impacts of development through the better enforcement of protective legislation. Increased monitoring efforts for amphibian populations may also be required given the potential for deadly diseases such as the fungus chytridiomycosis to break out on the island especially as disease has been associated with dramatic amphibian declines on nearby islands (6).

In addition many of the older trees are dying indicating that the population does not appear to be naturally regenerating (5) (7). The rarity of the bastard quiver tree may be partly attributed to their habitat; in harsh environments the problems of survival are amplified (5). Similar declines in population regeneration in sister species <i>Aloe dichotoma</i> (the quiver tree) have been attributed to climate change (8) and it is very likely that the bastard quiver tree is being affected similarly.

The Cat Loc population may be too small to be viable, and no breeding has been observed for many years, and it is possible that the animals are too old to breed. The population is so small that all the animals could be of the same sex.

In addition habitat loss resulting from logging activities and development has impacted the species and the two critically small populations are also exceptionally vulnerable to disease and natural disasters both of which could wipe out an entire population (6).,In Indonesia the Javan rhino has been legally protected since 1931 and Ujung Kulon National Park was set aside for the conservation of this species. The protected area in which the Vietnamese Javan rhinoceros occurs (previously known as the Cat Loc Nature Reserve) was for many years ineffectively protected (6) but since the Cat Loc area was integrated into the Cat Tien National Park in 1998 more forest guards have been deployed and the conservation organisation WWF has been supporting these teams with better equipment and allowances (7). ,loss;hunting;disease; ,protected;wwf; ,3,2.0,yes,1

By 2000 the species had undergone an estimated 80 percent population decline and is also now much reduced in range (1) (2) (4). Channel modifications including dams dredging and mining together with pollution sedimentation and water withdrawal all directly threaten the oyster musselâ??s habitat (1) (2) (3) (4) while impoundments such as dams can greatly alter factors such as water flow temperature and oxygen levels as well as presenting barriers to dispersal. Adverse effects on host fish can also indirectly impact the musselâ??s reproductive cycle. Large portions of the oyster musselâ??s historical range including the entire length of the main Tennessee and Cumberland River channels are now impounded or greatly modified leading to the extirpation of the oyster mussel from many areas (2) (3) (4). The small and fragmented populations that remain are under increased risk from isolated events such as chemical spills or from the potential negative effects of genetic isolation (4).,In 1997 the oyster mussel was listed as Endangered by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (7) and a recovery plan was drawn up for the species (4). The conservation measures recommended by this plan include the protection of remaining mussel populations and habitat identifying or re-establishing additional populations undertaking further research into the speciesâ?? ecology life history and genetic diversity the implementation of a monitoring programme and working to improve habitat quality (3) (4). Techniques for the artificial propagation of laboratory- or hatchery-reared mussels are also being developed with the ultimate aim of reintroducing the oyster mussel into parts of its historical range (3) (4) (8). ,pollution; , ,1,0.0,yes,0

In Indonesia habitat destruction is a major problem as a result of illegal and commercial logging and large agricultural projects such as rubber and oil palm plantations (7).  Sumatra has a very high rate of habitat loss with some areas losing up to 65 percent of their forest cover in the last 25 years (8).Â Only 33.8 percent of Sumatra remains covered by <strong>primary forest</strong> and only 1.3 percent of this is upper montane vegetation in which <i>Nepenthes lavicola </i>is found.  The highly localised distribution of <i>Nepenthes lavicola</i> makes it particularly susceptible to the impacts of habitat disturbance or catastrophic environmental events such as drought or fire.  In addition highland plants such as <i>Nepenthes lavicola</i> take longer than lowland plants to recover from any disturbance as growth is slower (2).,<i>Nepenthes lavicola </i>is listed on Appendix II of the Convention of International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) which limits international trade in this species.  However this is very difficult to regulate.  Trade in <i>Nepenthes</i> species does not need to be identified down to species level and plants simply labelled as <i>Nepenthes </i>accounted for 94 percent of exported plants between 1988 and 1993.  This needs to be remedied and urgent attention is required to close other trade loopholes. Presently over-collection does not seem to pose an extensive threat for <i>Nepenthes lavicola</i> and artificial cultivation reduces this threat further (2).  Conservation efforts can be made more effective not only by the implementation and enforcement of protective laws but also by the encouragement of artificial propagation and establishment of habitat reserves (9). ,loss;environmental;environment; ,cites; ,3,1.0,yes,0
