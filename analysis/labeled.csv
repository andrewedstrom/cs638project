For centuries MadagascarÃ¢??s forests have experienced successive waves of degradation at the hands of human colonists each with different destructive patterns of land use (7). In more recent years illegal and commercial logging charcoal production and burning to clear land for agriculture or cattle pasture have all had a devastating impact often changing open forest into dense shrubby undergrowth unsuitable as rat habitat or destroying the vegetation completely (3). The rats continue to suffer from human disturbance in the remaining forests which are used by the villagers to gather firewood collect honey dig up edible roots and hunt tenrecs and lemurs (3) (7). Predation by introduced predators such as dogs may also be playing a significant role in this speciesÃ¢?? decline (3).,This large rodent is in urgent need of conservation and its future remains highly uncertain. The Durrell Wildlife Conservation Trust is currently working closely with the Madagascan government and local community to help protect the species and has also established a captive breeding programme (5). The Menabe Forest an Alliance for Zero Extinction site due to the presence of this and a number of other endangered species was previously heavily impacted by subsistence farming wood extraction and livestock ranching. Fortunately in order to protect its unique but rapidly diminishing biodiversity the Madagascan government aims to expand the nationÃ¢??s protected area network and on March 28 2006 the Minister of the Environment Water and Forests signed a decree giving 125000 hectares of Menabe Forest temporary protected status. This is the first step towards making the site an official protected area. However while community and conservation groups have begun the slow process of agreeing on the official boundaries and goals of the new protected area (9) prospectors have begun using dynamite to search for oil reserves in Menabe causing concerns about further forest degradation (7).

Current areas of habitat are threatened by slash and burn agriculture, charcoal production, burning for cattle pasture and logging (Sommer 2003). There is a road that now cuts through the middle of the species' range, and has divided the range. Throughout its range, increasing visits by hunters and their dogs have targeted this species.

For centuries MadagascarÃ¢??s forests have experienced successive waves of degradation at the hands of human colonists each with different destructive patterns of land use (7). In more recent years illegal and commercial logging charcoal production and burning to clear land for agriculture or cattle pasture have all had a devastating impact often changing open forest into dense shrubby undergrowth unsuitable as rat habitat or destroying the vegetation completely (3). The rats continue to suffer from human disturbance in the remaining forests which are used by the villagers to gather firewood collect honey dig up edible roots and hunt tenrecs and lemurs (3) (7). Predation by introduced predators such as dogs may also be playing a significant role in this speciesÃ¢?? decline (3).,This large rodent is in urgent need of conservation and its future remains highly uncertain. The Durrell Wildlife Conservation Trust is currently working closely with the Madagascan government and local community to help protect the species and has also established a captive breeding programme (5). The Menabe Forest an Alliance for Zero Extinction site due to the presence of this and a number of other endangered species was previously heavily impacted by subsistence farming wood extraction and livestock ranching. Fortunately in order to protect its unique but rapidly diminishing biodiversity the Madagascan government aims to expand the nationÃ¢??s protected area network and on March 28 2006 the Minister of the Environment Water and Forests signed a decree giving 125000 hectares of Menabe Forest temporary protected status. This is the first step towards making the site an official protected area. However while community and conservation groups have begun the slow process of agreeing on the official boundaries and goals of the new protected area (9) prospectors have begun using dynamite to search for oil reserves in Menabe causing concerns about further forest degradation (7). Official full protected status is urgently needed in this area if the Malagasy giant rat is to be successfully brought back from the brink of extinction. ,loss;pet; ,captive breeding;protected; ,Endangered,"['Tanzania', 'Kenya']",2,2,

Consequently trade in this butterfly has been somewhat reduced but illegal collection continues to threaten this species. Today however the greatest threat to Queen AlexandraÃ¢??s birdwing is the loss of its lowland rainforest habitat. Historically forests were cleared for subsistence farming and logging and large tracts of forest were destroyed by the volcanic eruption of Mount Lamington in 1951. Presently the main cause behind forest loss is the expansion of the palm oil industry compounded by the development of rubber and cocoa plantations (7).Â Â ,Threatened by illegal trade and habitat loss the survival of Queen AlexandraÃ¢??s birdwing is dependant upon the successful implementation of conservation measures. To abate trade pressure Queen AlexandraÃ¢??s birdwing is listed on Appendix I of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) and as an Annex A species in the EU Council Regulation on trade of wild species both of which prohibit international trade (2) (3). Furthermore the Papua New Guinea government has provided financial aid to local communities to develop butterfly nurseries.Â  These licensed farms aim to sustainably trade wild butterflies whilst providing local communities with an additional income and improving the long-term survival prospects of many rare butterfly species (8).

    Hunting for the purposes of traditional ""medicine"" is the primary threat facing this species; most of the populations that survive are heavily reduced and fragmented. Only the subpopulation at Van Long, with about 50 individuals, is thought likely to survive given the current hunting pressure; however, quarrying for limestone (cement), which is currently taking place there, has affected the ranging behaviour of the animals (T. Nadler pers. comm.). The smallest groups are extremely unlikely to survive should the one reproductively active male be taken or killed (Nadler 2004).

Van Long Nature Reserve was established for this species in 2001, and there has been some evidence of population growth in this reserve in the past five years. The connection of forest fragments in some already protected areas, such as Van Long, could greatly increase the size and survivability of some subpopulations. Also considered as beneficial population management for this species are the translocation of severely threatened (small) groups to safe and suitable habitat, and the augmentation of existing groups with offspring from a captive population. Delacour's langurs have been successfully kept and bred in captivity at the Endangered Primate Rescue Center in Cuc Phuong National Park, Viet Nam, which is currently the only collection keeping this species (Nadler 2004).

During the 1990s when Vietnam opened itself up to the international community and the Chinese economy started to boom traders and poachers moved in to utilise VietnamÃ¢??s biodiversity (4). Poachers killed this langur not only for meat but also for bones organs and tissues that are used in traditional medicines (8). Hunting has reduced in recent years with increasing legal protection but continues to pose a significant threat. Habitat loss is also a danger to this species with the World Conservation Monitoring Centre of the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP-WCMC) estimating that a total of 30000 hectares of forest are destroyed each year in Vietnam (4). The clearing of forests to accommodate human commercial and residential growth continues to separate the remaining populations of DelacourÃ¢??s langur which are now at risk of becoming too small to be viably sustainable (2). Sixty percent of DelacourÃ¢??s langurs occur in isolated populations of fewer than 20 individuals. The loss of these sub-populations and consequently 60 percent of the whole population is feared likely in the near future without management strict regulations and law enforcement (5).,Four areas where DelacourÃ¢??s langurs are protected include: Cuc Phuong National Park Pu Luong Nature Reserve Hoa Lu Cultural and Historical Site and the recently-established Van Long Nature Reserve which is believed to contain the largest remaining population of around 70 individuals (5) (8). Unfortunately protected areas often suffer more from poaching than unprotected areas because their dense population of wildlife is seen as more profitable (2). Thus conservation groups are working to increase the level of protection and law enforcement within these protected areas. The Van Long Nature Reserve is now well guarded by rangers largely funded by the Frankfurt Zoological Society. The Pu Luong Nature Reserve also employs a large number of rangers which are helping to save the small remaining populations (8). These are encouraging steps towards helping the survival of DelacourÃ¢??s langur listed as one of the 25 most endangered primates in the world (8).

Consequently trade in this butterfly has been somewhat reduced but illegal collection continues to threaten this species. Today however the greatest threat to Queen AlexandraÃ¢??s birdwing is the loss of its lowland rainforest habitat. Historically forests were cleared for subsistence farming and logging and large tracts of forest were destroyed by the volcanic eruption of Mount Lamington in 1951. Presently the main cause behind forest loss is the expansion of the palm oil industry compounded by the development of rubber and cocoa plantations (7).Â Â ,Threatened by illegal trade and habitat loss the survival of Queen AlexandraÃ¢??s birdwing is dependant upon the successful implementation of conservation measures. To abate trade pressure Queen AlexandraÃ¢??s birdwing is listed on Appendix I of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) and as an Annex A species in the EU Council Regulation on trade of wild species both of which prohibit international trade (2) (3). Furthermore the Papua New Guinea government has provided financial aid to local communities to develop butterfly nurseries.Â  These licensed farms aim to sustainably trade wild butterflies whilst providing local communities with an additional income and improving the long-term survival prospects of many rare butterfly species (8). In addition a large wildlife management area has been created protecting much Queen AlexandraÃ¢??s birdwing habitat. Assuming these measures continue successfully there is significant hope that the beautiful Queen AlexandraÃ¢??s birdwing will continue to grace the forests of Papua New Guinea (7).Â  ,loss; ,cites; ,Critically Endangered,['Vietnam'],1,1,

It may also be advisable to establish a self-sustaining captive population in collaboration with the Ethiopian conservation authorities, as an insurance against future adversity for the wild population.\n\n    \n  ']",Decreasing,Endangered,1,Tragelaphus buxtoni,mountain nyala ,Animalia,Chordata,Mammalia,Cetartiodactyla,Bovidae,Tragelaphus ,150 - 320 kg (3) (4),The mountain nyala has undergone a substantial decline in recent decades from an estimated 7000 to 8000 individuals in the 1960s (2) (11) to perhaps fewer than 2500 today (1) although others believe it to number nearer 4000 (4). It has also reduced in range and remaining populations are fragmented making them particularly vulnerable (1) (10). The main threats to the mountain nyala come from human activity within its range with increasing human and livestock populations putting ever-increasing pressure on the species through illegal hunting competition with cattle predation by domestic dogs and habitat clearance for agriculture grazing firewood harvesting and settlement (1) (2) (4) (10) (11). The species has been extensively hunted for its meat and horns and there is continued pressure from the trophy hunting industry to increase hunting quotas (1) (4).,Despite being fully protected by law enforcement is generally absent and the mountain nyala is only effectively protected within a small area in the north of Bale Mountains National Park which is estimated to hold a large proportion of the total population (1) (9) (14). A smaller protected area Kuni-Muktar Wildlife Sanctuary was established for the species in 1990 but severe poaching deforestation cultivation and erosion were thought to have eliminated the mountain nyala there (1) (10) until the presence of a small population was confirmed in 2003 (4).

Much of Sri LankaÃ¢??s original tropical moist montane forest has been cleared during the last two centuries for cinchona coffee tea rubber and cardamom plantations for grazing livestock by logging companies illegal logging and removal of timber by peripheral villagers (5) (8). The montane forests of the Knuckles Mountains where this species is found have been particularly affected by cardamom cultivation which requires that much of the forest understorey is cleared and although the canopy is retained for shade continuing weeding of the area to remove competing vegetation prevents natural regeneration of the forest. Some areas are also still cultivated for vegetables using traditional slash and burn techniques and on occasion this can lead to out-of-control forest fires (6). With a rapidly growing population and increasing demand for agricultural land the destruction of montane forests continues at an alarming rate. Further more there is intensive use of pesticides on vegetable cultivations and tea plantations in Sri Lanka which could be having a serious polluting affect. Although the impact these chemicals are having on non-target species is not yet known studies elsewhere indicate that they could potentially be devastating with possibilities for <strong>bioaccumulation</strong>. There is also evidence in the tropical moist montane forests of the Knuckles Mountains of large-scale forest die-back thought to be the result of acid rain and these forests are considered particularly at risk from climate change especially global warming (5).,Project Knuckles 2004 and a follow-up expedition in 2005 were initiated to conduct the first in-depth study of reptiles and the primary threats facing them in the Knuckles Mountain Range (6). It was discovered that the region held some of the highest reptile diversity in the country and is therefore an important site for conservation. TennentÃ¢??s leaf-nosed lizard was one of three target species studied (9). As of 2000 areas above 1067 m above sea level were given protected status as conservation forest. As such cardamom cultivation has had to be abandoned in the area. However rather than allowing the natural regeneration of native forest the cardamom appears to have been replaced by a series of invasive weeds such as mistflower (<i>Eupatorium riparium</i>) and Lantana (<i>Lantana camara</i>) (6). Fortunately TennentÃ¢??s leaf-nosed lizards appear to be fairly adaptable and tolerant of some degree of habitat disturbance having been recorded from forests under planted with cardamom and pine plantations providing hope for the long-term survival of this unique unusual looking reptile (3) (6). ,loss;fragmentation;pet; ,protected; ,Critically Endangered,"['Cambodia', 'China', 'Thailand', 'Laos']",4,3,

Their slow growth rate and late onset of sexual maturity make these fish extremely vulnerable to the effects of over-fishing (5). Not only does this mean that individuals are often harvested many years before reaching maturity and therefore unable to increase abundance through reproduction but also that populations will be slow to recover from collapses in numbers (7). Since population numbers are now too low to sustain target fisheries Atlantic halibut are predominantly taken as <strong>bycatch</strong> by bottom trawlers and longliners (8). Surveys indicate that these fish have continued to decline in the North Atlantic over the past two decades despite being taken only incidentally as <strong>bycatch</strong> with little targeted halibut fishing (7).,There is currently no management plan in place for this fish and it is therefore thought probable that numbers of Atlantic halibut will continue to decline.

Indeed much of the forest understorey has been cleared for planting cardamom in the Knuckles Mountains where this lizard is found although the canopy has been retained for shade (4). The Agra-Bopath area of this speciesÃ¢?? range is becoming increasingly isolated by surrounding vegetable cultivations and tea plantations with the lack of clearly demarcated boundaries leading to significant encroachment into this forest (4) (5). Isolation of populations prevents both important genetic flow between subpopulations and means of escape from forest fires (4) (7). Further more there is intensive use of pesticides on vegetable cultivations and tea plantations in Sri Lanka which could be having a serious polluting affect. Although the impact these chemicals are having on non-target species is not yet known studies elsewhere indicate that they could potentially be devastating (4) with possibilities for <strong>bioaccumulation</strong> (5). Climatic change and global warming may also be having a negative impact on the species as a result of forest diebacks due to acid rain (5). Domestic animals in the Knuckles Mountains such as cats dogs and poultry also prey on reptiles (7) although the <strong>arboreal</strong> nature of the spineless forest lizard probably limits this threat.,Project Knuckles 2004 was initiated to conduct the first in-depth study of reptiles and the primary threats facing them in the Knuckles Mountain Range (7). It was discovered that the region held some of the highest reptile diversity in the country and is therefore an important site for conservation (9). The spineless forest lizard was one of three target species studied (9).

Indeed so dramatic were these declines that between 1932 and 1980 commercial landings diminished from 115 tonnes biomass to 5 tonnes in Californian waters and from 363 tonnes to 12 tonnes in Mexican waters. The speciesÃ¢?? limited distribution large size and aggregation in spawning areas made it an easy target for fisheries (1). Unfortunately its slow growth and late onset of sexual maturity make the fish extremely vulnerable to population collapses from over-fishing and slow to recover (5). Additionally it appears that the black sea bass may also be suffering from toxin poisoning. Sediments along the coast of California have been found to carry very high levels of toxins such as DDE and PCB with an area off the Palos Verdes peninsula thought to contain possibly the highest loads of DDE (a breakdown product of DDT) in the worldÃ¢??s oceans. The toxins cannot be broken down so as a mid-level predator black sea bass ingest the cumulative toxins in increased concentrations from the food chain below it and have been found to be carrying extremely high body burdens of DDE and PCB in southern California. The chemicals have been recorded to interfere with normal reproductive biology in other species of fish as well as amphibians reptiles and birds but more research is needed into the effects they are having on this giant fish and its process of recovery in California (3).,The black sea bass has been protected in California since 1981 and in Mexico since 1992. Both commercial and recreational fishing of this species were prohibited in California in 1981 although two fish per angler per trip are allowed to be caught south of the U.S.-Mexican border and one fish per trip to be taken incidentally by commercial fishermen. The law also limited the amount of black sea bass that could be caught in Mexican waters and landed in California (1). Although these laws have prevented commercial fishermen from targeting and profiting from these fish they have failed to protect the habitats occupied by the species from fishing and have probably done little to reduce incidental mortality since black sea bass entangled in nets have simply been discarded back into the sea (5). Indeed many fish in spawning aggregations in the summer have been caught and released frequently receiving injuries in the process (6). However the banning of gill nets in California in 1990 has probably helped significantly reduce the incidental mortality of this species and anecdotal data suggest that numbers may be beginning to rebound (1) (5). Nevertheless either voluntary or imposed seasonal and/or area closures would undoubtedly help further minimise incidental mortalities and greatly aid the recovery of this magnificent and dramatic giant of the sea (3) (6). ,fishing; ,protected; ,Critically Endangered,"['Venezuela', 'Mexico']",2,1,

    The desiccation and pollution of the canal system and lakes in Xochimilco and Chalco, as a result of urbanization, as well as the traditional consumption of the species by local people, is threatening the survival of this species. Increased tourist activity is poorly regulated and adds further pollution (Zambrano, 2006). The species is also captured for medicinal purposes. The harvesting is targeted at animals that are less than one year old. It was formerly also captured for the international pet trade, although probably all animals in the international trade are now of captive origin. Introduced fishes (tilapia and carp) have increased to high abundances (a recent study collected 600kg of tilapia in one small channel using a 100m net) and have also impacted axolotls through competition and predation. The animals are also being affected by disease, probably spread by invasive species, and as a result of poor water quality.

The most significant threat to the axolotl is the increasing pollution of the lakes and canal system as Mexico City continues to grow (1). Land drainage flood control and sewage disposal methods from the 17th century to the present have all contributed to the destruction of the water system of Mexico City (3).,Recent stabilisation of axolotl numbers may be attributable to the restoration of the Parco Ecologico Xochimilco over the last 20 years. This protected area requires continued restoration to support the axolotl population which it is hoped may begin to increase with the introduction of captive-bred axolotls.

Although Ã¢??subsistenceÃ¢?? gathering of the species has occurred for hundreds of years by native people together with collection for its yellow-rayed <strong>carapace</strong> which is used for a container for cooking oil seeds etc. the impact was relatively small and sustainable. In recent years however subsistence has been replaced by mass commercial harvesting as the price of this species skyrocketed in the Asian markets (primarily Taiwan and China) (8). The tortoise has also been hard hit recently by the illegal international pet trade often ending up in European and North American collections (9). With their distinctive markings and dramatic colours these tortoises are attractive to collectors and their rarity makes them particularly valuable (10). Indeed adults can fetch up to US$7000 each from private collectors in the Western world (10) and this high price and demand encourages overexploitation of wild populations (5). Habitat destruction and wild fires also pose a threat to these tortoises particularly to smaller individuals (5).,The Burmese star tortoise exists in two protected areas Shwe Settaw Wildlife Sanctuary and Minzontaung Wildlife Sanctuary and an area proposed for protected status Myaleik Taung. At the Minzontaung Wildlife Sanctuary and Myaleik Taung the species is protected by local religious beliefs that deem it bad luck to collect the tortoises and commercial poaching is so far virtually non-existent. The Sanctuary is also well patrolled by guards with access strictly controlled and wild fires are managed. The Minzontaung Wildlife Sanctuary and Myaleik Taung therefore offer excellent potential for the successful conservation of the Burmese star tortoise (5). Sadly the Shwe Settaw Wildlife Sanctuary does not seem to be faring so well which has recently been reduced by around 30% due to the sale of a large tract to an agricultural development consortium. Subsistence and commercial harvest from the Sanctuary is commonplace with one village trader admitting to collecting 300 individuals in 6 months and there being at least one trader in every village. The Burmese star tortoise is fully protected by law and it is a capital offence to remove them from the wild. However the Myanmar Government reportedly ignore the capture and sale of these tortoises or are easily bribed with rampant civil war and radical guerrilla soldiers near the borders deterring police involvement there. A captive breeding programme has been set up at the Shwe Settaw Wildlife Sanctuary but hybridisation with <i>Indotestudo elongata</i> in a shared fenced area has been common. There is also evidence that this area is quickly grazed and tortoises here starve to death at an alarming rate. Stricter enforcement of protection laws is desperately needed and more effective management protocols at this Sanctuary but as long as a lucrative market exists tortoise hunting is likely to remain an attractive economic option for rural people (8). One suggestion has been to promote the significance of rural religious beliefs for the benefit of tortoise conservation in this area which has helped protect this beautiful species so effectively in the Minzontaung Wildlife Sanctuary and Myaleik Taung (5). However in a financially depressed society such as this the economic lure of such profitable natural resources may sadly win out (8). ,pet; ,protection law;captive breeding;protected; ,Critically Endangered,"['Guinea', 'Gabon']",2,1,

Only the subpopulation at Van Long, with about 50 individuals, is thought likely to survive given the current hunting pressure; however, quarrying for limestone (cement), which is currently taking place there, has affected the ranging behaviour of the animals (T. Nadler pers. comm.). The smallest groups are extremely unlikely to survive should the one reproductively active male be taken or killed (Nadler 2004).

During the 1990s when Vietnam opened itself up to the international community and the Chinese economy started to boom traders and poachers moved in to utilise VietnamÃ¢??s biodiversity (4). Poachers killed this langur not only for meat but also for bones organs and tissues that are used in traditional medicines (8). Hunting has reduced in recent years with increasing legal protection but continues to pose a significant threat. Habitat loss is also a danger to this species with the World Conservation Monitoring Centre of the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP-WCMC) estimating that a total of 30000 hectares of forest are destroyed each year in Vietnam (4). The clearing of forests to accommodate human commercial and residential growth continues to separate the remaining populations of DelacourÃ¢??s langur which are now at risk of becoming too small to be viably sustainable (2). Sixty percent of DelacourÃ¢??s langurs occur in isolated populations of fewer than 20 individuals. The loss of these sub-populations and consequently 60 percent of the whole population is feared likely in the near future without management strict regulations and law enforcement (5).,Four areas where DelacourÃ¢??s langurs are protected include: Cuc Phuong National Park Pu Luong Nature Reserve Hoa Lu Cultural and Historical Site and the recently-established Van Long Nature Reserve which is believed to contain the largest remaining population of around 70 individuals (5) (8).

Habitat destruction has been the major cause of this decline and wetland areas continue to be modified for agriculture in an effort to cope with the intense human population pressure in the region (4). A highly secretive species spending a long period of time (6 to 7 months) below ground in burrows the Chinese alligator now primarily exists in populated areas where it inevitably comes into conflict with local farmers. Burrow systems cause drainage problems for fields and alligators also consume ducks owned by farmers (2). Despite a lack of commercial value for the Chinese alligator's skin on the international market these reptiles are often killed when encountered either through fear or due to a threat to livelihood (2).,In contrast to the decimated wild population the breeding of captive Chinese alligators has been very successful and the captive population currently exceeds 10000 individuals (2). The Anhui Research Centre of Chinese Alligator Reproduction (ARCCAR) was established in 1979 and houses captive-bred alligators within 26 small protected reserves (2). Any wild populations that remain are severely fragmented and almost none exist in their natural habitat (2). However the Chinese government has recently allocated funds to create new habitats with a view to introduce captive-bred alligators into the wild in three other provinces (2).

The area has suffered widespread disruption and destruction of its wetland habitat from agricultural development tapping of vernal pools for irrigation of crops river channelisation and encroaching urban development all of which are thought to have played a role in the demise of this species (2) (4). Additionally an introduced alien plant garden lippia (<i>Phyla</i> spp.) poses an immediate threat to the speciesÃ¢?? remaining range. The plant forms dense mats in vernal pools crowding out native vegetation and hindering the beetleÃ¢??s foraging (2). Only around 75 individuals have been seen since 1974 and the speciesÃ¢?? small range places it in very serious danger of extinction (4).,The delta green ground beetle is protected by the Lacey Act which prohibits its import export transport sale purchase receipt or acquisition (4). The beetle is also protected through its occurrence in the Jepson Prairie Reserve (5) but other suitable sites nearby are on private land and negotiations over their protection are ongoing (2). Since its life cycle is intricately intertwined with the seasonal changes of its vernal pool habitat conservation of the delta green ground beetle very much depends upon the protection of this habitat which is itself endangered (2).

The rarity of the bastard quiver tree may be partly attributed to their habitat; in harsh environments the problems of survival are amplified (5). Similar declines in population regeneration in sister species <i>Aloe dichotoma</i> (the quiver tree) have been attributed to climate change (8) and it is very likely that the bastard quiver tree is being affected similarly. These effects are worsened by the removal of plants by horticultural collectors as well as through herbivory by baboon porcupines rock rabbits and livestock which also trample young plantsÂ (4) (5) (7).

For centuries MadagascarÃ¢??s forests have experienced successive waves of degradation at the hands of human colonists each with different destructive patterns of land use (7). In more recent years illegal and commercial logging charcoal production and burning to clear land for agriculture or cattle pasture have all had a devastating impact often changing open forest into dense shrubby undergrowth unsuitable as rat habitat or destroying the vegetation completely (3). The rats continue to suffer from human disturbance in the remaining forests which are used by the villagers to gather firewood collect honey dig up edible roots and hunt tenrecs and lemurs (3) (7). Predation by introduced predators such as dogs may also be playing a significant role in this speciesÃ¢?? decline (3).,This large rodent is in urgent need of conservation and its future remains highly uncertain. The Durrell Wildlife Conservation Trust is currently working closely with the Madagascan government and local community to help protect the species and has also established a captive breeding programme (5). The Menabe Forest an Alliance for Zero Extinction site due to the presence of this and a number of other endangered species was previously heavily impacted by subsistence farming wood extraction and livestock ranching. Fortunately in order to protect its unique but rapidly diminishing biodiversity the Madagascan government aims to expand the nationÃ¢??s protected area network and on March 28 2006 the Minister of the Environment Water and Forests signed a decree giving 125000 hectares of Menabe Forest temporary protected status. This is the first step towards making the site an official protected area. However while community and conservation groups have begun the slow process of agreeing on the official boundaries and goals of the new protected area (9) prospectors have begun using dynamite to search for oil reserves in Menabe causing concerns about further forest degradation (7).

Although Ã¢??subsistenceÃ¢?? gathering of the species has occurred for hundreds of years by native people together with collection for its yellow-rayed <strong>carapace</strong> which is used for a container for cooking oil seeds etc. the impact was relatively small and sustainable. In recent years however subsistence has been replaced by mass commercial harvesting as the price of this species skyrocketed in the Asian markets (primarily Taiwan and China) (8). The tortoise has also been hard hit recently by the illegal international pet trade often ending up in European and North American collections (9). With their distinctive markings and dramatic colours these tortoises are attractive to collectors and their rarity makes them particularly valuable (10). Indeed adults can fetch up to US$7000 each from private collectors in the Western world (10) and this high price and demand encourages overexploitation of wild populations (5). Habitat destruction and wild fires also pose a threat to these tortoises particularly to smaller individuals (5).,The Burmese star tortoise exists in two protected areas Shwe Settaw Wildlife Sanctuary and Minzontaung Wildlife Sanctuary and an area proposed for protected status Myaleik Taung. At the Minzontaung Wildlife Sanctuary and Myaleik Taung the species is protected by local religious beliefs that deem it bad luck to collect the tortoises and commercial poaching is so far virtually non-existent. The Sanctuary is also well patrolled by guards with access strictly controlled and wild fires are managed. The Minzontaung Wildlife Sanctuary and Myaleik Taung therefore offer excellent potential for the successful conservation of the Burmese star tortoise (5). Sadly the Shwe Settaw Wildlife Sanctuary does not seem to be faring so well which has recently been reduced by around 30% due to the sale of a large tract to an agricultural development consortium. Subsistence and commercial harvest from the Sanctuary is commonplace with one village trader admitting to collecting 300 individuals in 6 months and there being at least one trader in every village. The Burmese star tortoise is fully protected by law and it is a capital offence to remove them from the wild. However the Myanmar Government reportedly ignore the capture and sale of these tortoises or are easily bribed with rampant civil war and radical guerrilla soldiers near the borders deterring police involvement there. A captive breeding programme has been set up at the Shwe Settaw Wildlife Sanctuary but hybridisation with <i>Indotestudo elongata</i> in a shared fenced area has been common. There is also evidence that this area is quickly grazed and tortoises here starve to death at an alarming rate. Stricter enforcement of protection laws is desperately needed and more effective management protocols at this Sanctuary but as long as a lucrative market exists tortoise hunting is likely to remain an attractive economic option for rural people (8). One suggestion has been to promote the significance of rural religious beliefs for the benefit of tortoise conservation in this area which has helped protect this beautiful species so effectively in the Minzontaung Wildlife Sanctuary and Myaleik Taung (5). However in a financially depressed society such as this the economic lure of such profitable natural resources may sadly win out (8). ,pet; ,protection law;captive breeding;protected; ,Critically Endangered,['Peru'],1,1,1.0

A highly secretive species spending a long period of time (6 to 7 months) below ground in burrows the Chinese alligator now primarily exists in populated areas where it inevitably comes into conflict with local farmers. Burrow systems cause drainage problems for fields and alligators also consume ducks owned by farmers (2). Despite a lack of commercial value for the Chinese alligator's skin on the international market these reptiles are often killed when encountered either through fear or due to a threat to livelihood (2).,In contrast to the decimated wild population the breeding of captive Chinese alligators has been very successful and the captive population currently exceeds 10000 individuals (2).

Although the Evrotas River naturally dries up during periods of drought water extraction for agriculture has exacerbated this resulting in fish being stranded in stagnant pools of water with low oxygen concentration and high temperatures (1) (6). This was most severe in 2007 when a prolonged drought resulted in around 80 percent of the main river course drying up (6). As the European dace inhabits fast flowing cold waters mass fish mortality has been observed in areas where its habitat has been degraded in such a way (5).

    Declines have been caused by water pollution, siltation, and construction of reservoirs for hydropower, navigation, and flood control (USFWS 1995, End. Sp. Tech. Bull. 16[5]:8). These degraded/destroyed the habitat and fragmented the populations. Current concerns include siltation and excessive nutrient inputs deriving from runoff from small-scale agriculture, grazing, and urbanization (USFWS 1995, J. M. Pierson pers. comm. 1995).

A decrease in water quality was probably the most significant agent as the loss of the species from the Cahaba River coincided with an increase in nitrogen and phosphorous caused by sewage discharge. This led to higher algal biomass and decreased levels of dissolved oxygen in the water (4) (5). The blue shiner is also threatened by increased siltation as it relies on sight to detect its prey while in Georgia urbanisation and resulting pollution and water extraction threatens the speciesÃ¢?? habitat. In many areas the blue shiner now exists in small highly fragmented populations which are more vulnerable to habitat degradation and a loss of <strong>genetic diversity</strong> greatly increasing the speciesÃ¢?? extinction risk (5) (7).,The future of the blue shiner very much depends on the protection of its habitat particularly the Conasauga River. Fortunately for this rare species efforts are underway to protect this fragile environment. The Nature Conservancy is working with private landowners and government agencies to protect the Conasauga River and conserve the populations of rare and endangered fish that inhabit its waters (5) (8). The National Resources Conservation Service is also working to protect <strong>riparian</strong> habitat around the Conasauga River and to tackle threats (5) (9). The blue shiner will also benefit from further studies into its ecology threats and population trends (5). ,loss;pollution; , ,Endangered,"['United Kingdom', 'New Zealand']",2,2,1.0
