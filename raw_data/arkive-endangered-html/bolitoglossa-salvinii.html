        <h2><img src="/rimg/factsheet/Status.png" class="heading" /></h2><p class="Status"><p>Classified as Endangered (EN) on the IUCN Red List (1)<warehouse:ref entitytype="ScientificReference"></warehouse:ref><warehouse:ref entitytype="ScientificReference">.</warehouse:ref></p></p><h2><img src="/rimg/factsheet/Description.png" class="heading" /></h2><p class="Description"><p>Belonging to a diverse group of amphibians known as the lungless salamanders (Plethodontidae) (4) (5) (6) (7), Salvin’s mushroomtongue salamander is a strikingly coloured amphibian, its black body marked with an orange to reddish or purplish-brown band along the back, edged with a wavy yellow border and with variable and irregular black spots (8) (9). A relatively large and robust species, with well-developed limbs, it has a long, thick, <strong>prehensile</strong> tail, an adaptation to the species’ <strong>arboreal</strong> lifestyle. The large, fully webbed hands and feet are also thought to give good grip when climbing (3) (4) (5) (6) (8) (9).</p>
<p>As in other lungless salamanders, the female Salvin’s mushroomtongue salamander grows larger than the male, although males tend to have a broader head, longer legs, and larger hands and feet (6). Breeding males also possess an enlarged ‘mental gland’ under the chin, which is rubbed on the female’s body during courtship (6) (7). All lungless salamanders are characterised by the presence of a distinctive shallow groove, known as the ‘nasolabial groove’, which runs on each side of the head from the nostril to the edge of the upper lip, and serves to carry chemical signals from the ground to the nasal cavity (4) (6) (7).</p></p><h2><img src="/rimg/factsheet/Range.png" class="heading" /></h2><p class="Range"><p>Salvin’s mushroomtongue salamander has been recorded from the upper coastal plain on the Pacific slopes of southern Guatemala, as well as from one location in El Salvador (1) (8) (10) (11).</p></p><h2><img src="/rimg/factsheet/Habitat.png" class="heading" /></h2><p class="Habitat"><p>This species originally inhabited forest, including dry forest and lowland wet forest, but with the loss of these habitats from much of its range it is now most commonly found in shaded coffee and banana plantations, and in sugarcane fields (1) (8). Salvin’s mushroomtongue salamander has been observed climbing on <em>Heliconia</em> leaves and other large-leafed plants (3), and has been recorded at elevations of around 600 to 1,250 metres (1) (8) (10) (11).</p></p><h2><img src="/rimg/factsheet/Biology.png" class="heading" /></h2><p class="Biology"><p>An active, climbing species (3), Salvin’s mushroomtongue salamander feeds on small <strong>invertebrates</strong>, such as insects. Prey is captured using the remarkable projectile tongue, which can be shot out at great speed to strike moving prey at some distance away (3) (4) (6). If attacked, <em>Bolitoglossa</em> species may arch the back and wave the tail, and can even shed the tail if it is grasped by a predator (4) (6). As the group’s name suggests, lungless salamanders are unusual in lacking lungs, meaning that these species must instead absorb oxygen through the skin and the mouth lining (4) (5) (6) (7).</p>
<p>Salvin’s mushroomtongue salamander is likely to be active year-round, with breeding potentially taking place at any time of the year (4). The male salamander produces a gelatinous packet of sperm, known as a <strong>spermatophore</strong>, which, after successful courtship, is picked up from the substrate in the <strong>cloaca</strong> of the female (7). <strong>Fertilisation</strong> then occurs inside the female’s body (4) (7). Female <em>Bolitoglossa</em> salamanders typically lay small clutches of eggs in damp places on land. The eggs may take several months to develop, and hatch directly into miniature versions of the adult rather than going through a <strong>larval</strong> stage (1) (4) (5) (6) (7).</p></p><h2><img src="/rimg/factsheet/Threats.png" class="heading" /></h2><p class="Threats"><p>Salvin’s mushroomtongue salamander was once relatively common, but has undergone a decline as a result of the loss and fragmentation of its forest habitat, mainly due to subsistence agriculture and wood extraction (1) (8). Since lungless salamanders need a damp environment to maintain the moist skin on which oxygen uptake depends (4), any alteration in moisture conditions poses a severe threat. Therefore, although it still survives in shaded plantations and sugarcane fields, any clearance of these to create more open, drier habitats would have a negative impact on this species (1). Similarly, climate change may also pose a threat, and already appears to be causing dramatic declines in other Central American salamanders (12). Although there is not yet any direct evidence that the fungal disease chytridiomycosis has contributed to these declines, its role in the decline of many other amphibian species suggests that it may also be a potential threat (12).</p></p><h2><img src="/rimg/factsheet/Conservation.png" class="heading" /></h2><p class="Conservation"><p>No specific conservation measures are currently known to be in place for Salvin’s mushroomtongue salamander, but the maintenance of shaded habitats has been identified as being important to its long-term survival (1). The species may potentially occur within the Parque Nacional El Imposible in El Salvador, although this is not yet confirmed. It is not currently known from any protected areas in Guatemala, but a number of protected areas have been proposed within its range and may benefit the species in the future (1).</p>
<p>Efforts to understand the causes of global amphibian declines have so far focused mainly on frogs, with relatively little attention on salamanders. However, the severe declines observed in many Central American salamander species has highlighted the need for increased understanding and protection of these unusual and intriguing amphibians (12).</p></p><h2><img src="/rimg/factsheet/FurtherInformation.png" class="heading" /></h2><p class="Find out more"><p>To find out more about the amphibians of Guatemala see:</p>

<li><strong>Invertebrates: </strong>animals with no backbone, such as insects, crustaceans, worms, molluscs, spiders, cnidarians (jellyfish, corals, sea anemones), echinoderms, and others.</li>
<li><strong>Larval: </strong>of the stage in an animal’s lifecycle after it hatches from the egg. Larvae are typically very different in appearance to adults; they are able to feed and move around but usually are unable to reproduce.</li>
<li><strong>Prehensile: </strong>capable of grasping.</li>
<li><strong>Spermatophore: </strong>gelatinous jelly cone with a sperm cap deposited by a male during courtship and picked up by the cloacal lips of the female.</li>
