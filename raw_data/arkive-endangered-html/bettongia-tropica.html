        <h2><img src="/rimg/factsheet/Status.png" class="heading" /></h2><p class="Status"><p>Classified as Endangered (EN) on the IUCN Red List (1) and listed on Appendix I of CITES (3).</p></p><h2><img src="/rimg/factsheet/Description.png" class="heading" /></h2><p class="Description"><p>While this small, compact <strong>marsupial</strong> belongs to the kangaroo family, at first glance it appears similar to a rat, as its alternative common name of northern rat kangaroo suggests (4). Compared to most kangaroos, the northern bettong is delicately built, but it does retain short and muscular forearms with small, clawed paws and heavily muscled, well-developed hind legs, and it moves with a low, springy hop (5). Its head is broad with a flat, naked muzzle, short, pointed ears, and bright, black eyes (6). Short, dense hair covers most of the body (7), which is pale greyish-brown on the back and cream on the underside (4). The northern bettong also possesses a weakly prehensile (grasping) tail, which has a distinctive short, black brush of fur at the tip (4) (6). Initially, the northern bettong was considered to be a <strong>subspecies</strong> of the brush-tailed bettong (<em>Bettongia penicillata</em>) due to its similar genetics and appearance, but the two are now recognised as distinct species (4).</p></p><h2><img src="/rimg/factsheet/Range.png" class="heading" /></h2><p class="Range"><p>The northern bettong is <strong>endemic</strong> to Queensland, Australia. Currently, it is found in three geographically isolated locations: the Lamb Range, Coane Range and Mount Carbine Tableland, all in north-eastern Queensland. There may also be a population in one further location, the Mount Windsor Tableland, but the northern bettong has not been recorded here for several years. It has been documented at elevations from 800 to 1,200 metres above sea level (1).</p></p><h2><img src="/rimg/factsheet/Habitat.png" class="heading" /></h2><p class="Habitat"><p>This small mammal prefers to inhabit forests dominated by eucalyptus trees, with a dense canopy and grassy forest floor (4).</p></p><h2><img src="/rimg/factsheet/Biology.png" class="heading" /></h2><p class="Biology"><p>The northern bettong is a <strong>nocturnal</strong> animal, which spends the day resting in a well-disguised nest built of grass and vegetation, commonly dug into a shallow hole in the ground. During the night, it may travel large distances in order to locate the broadly dispersed truffles (edible fruiting bodies of fungi) which constitute 45 percent of its diet. Cockatoo grass (<em>Alloteropsis semialata</em>) is another important component of the northern bettong’s diet, and it will also feed on other grasses and fungi, as well as a wide variety of leaves, seeds, insects and tubers (1).</p>
<p>A solitary animal, the northern bettong occupies a large <strong>home range</strong>, containing three or four nest sites which the bettong moves between. Males typically occupy a ‘core’ <strong>home range</strong> of 72 hectares, while females occupy a smaller 49 hectares, and home ranges typically overlap (8).</p>
<p>The northern bettong may breed at any time of year, regardless of the season (9). Females produce two to three litters every year, with a single young born per litter after a <strong>gestation</strong> period of about 21 days. Like all <strong>marsupials</strong>, the young is very undeveloped at birth and continues its development in the protection of the mother’s pouch, where it remains for 110 to 115 days. Female northern bettongs reach sexual maturity at around 11 months of age, while males reach maturity later, at around 14 months (10). Life expectancy is approximately six years (6).</p></p><h2><img src="/rimg/factsheet/Threats.png" class="heading" /></h2><p class="Threats"><p>Numbers of this rare species are thought to be declining (1). This fall in numbers has been attributed to several different threats, in particular the alteration of the northern bettong’s preferred habitat as a result of a change in fire regimes in the last half century. Less frequent fires have allowed rainforest to encroach into the species’ eucalypt forest habitat and, along with invasive <strong>feral</strong> pigs, this has affected the supply of its primary food source, truffles. Over-grazing has also substantially diminished vegetation which the bettong requires for both shelter and food, such as cockatoo grass. Furthermore, predation by domestic dogs is of concern, particularly in areas where humans live close to bettong habitat (1) (4).</p></p><h2><img src="/rimg/factsheet/Conservation.png" class="heading" /></h2><p class="Conservation"><p>Some of the northern bettong’s range lies within protected areas, including the Lamb Range State Forest, Wet Tropics World Heritage Area and the Davies Creek National Park (1), which should hopefully offer some protection from the many threats it faces. In addition, a recovery plan for the northern bettong has been established which includes plans for the maintenance of habitat, a restriction on forest clearing activities, the monitoring and management of fire and grazing regimes, and the monitoring and control of <strong>feral</strong> pigs and predators (11). It is hoped that the recovery plan will improve the conservation status of the northern bettong, not only by maintaining the existing wild populations but also by creating new ones.</p></p><h2><img src="/rimg/factsheet/FurtherInformation.png" class="heading" /></h2><p class="Find out more"><p>To find out about wildlife conservation in Queensland see:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Endemic: </strong>a species or taxonomic group that is only found in one particular country or geographic area.</li>
<li><strong>Feral: </strong>previously domesticated animals that have returned to a wild state.</li>
<li><strong>Gestation: </strong>the state of being pregnant; the period from conception to birth.</li>
<li><strong>Home range: </strong>the area occupied by an animal during routine activities, which is not actively defended.</li>
<li><strong>Marsupial: </strong>a diverse group of mammals characterised by their reproduction, in which gestation is very short, and the female typically has a pouch (marsupium) in which the young are raised. When born, the tiny young crawls to the mother’s teats, where it attaches and stays for a variable amount of time, whilst it continues to develop. Marsupials also differ from placental mammals in their dentition.</li>
<li><strong>Nocturnal: </strong>active at night.</li>
<li><strong>Subspecies: </strong>a population usually restricted to a geographical area that differs from other populations of the same species, but not to the extent of being classified as a separate species.</li>
