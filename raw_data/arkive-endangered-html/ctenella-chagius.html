<p>Like those of other <strong>colony</strong>-forming corals, <strong>colonies</strong> of <em>Ctenella chagius</em> are composed of numerous small <strong>polyps</strong>, which are soft-bodied animals, related to anemones. Each <strong>polyp</strong> bears numerous tentacles that direct food into a central mouth, where it is digested in a sac-like body cavity. One of the most remarkable and ecologically important features of these corals is that the <strong>polyps</strong> secrete a hard skeleton, called a ‘corallite’, which over successive generations contributes to the formation of a coral reef. The coral skeleton forms the bulk of the <strong>colony</strong>, with the living <strong>polyp</strong> tissue comprising only a thin veneer (4).</p></p><h2><img src="/rimg/factsheet/Range.png" class="heading" /></h2><p class="Range"><p><em>Ctenella chagius </em>is <strong>endemic</strong> to the Chagos Archipelago, where it is found around numerous islands including the British Indian Ocean Territory, Mauritius and Réunion Island (1). The coral reefs of the British Indian Ocean Territory cover roughly 4,000 square kilometres, which is approximately one and a half percent of the total global area of coral reefs (5), and are among the most diverse reefs known in the Indian Ocean (3).&nbsp;</p></p><h2><img src="/rimg/factsheet/Habitat.png" class="heading" /></h2><p class="Habitat"><p>This locally common species is found on reef slopes (1) (4) and lagoons, between depths of 3 and 45 metres (1).&nbsp;</p></p><h2><img src="/rimg/factsheet/Biology.png" class="heading" /></h2><p class="Biology"><p>Like many coral species, <em>Ctenella chagius</em> is zooxanthellate (6), meaning its tissues contain large numbers of single-celled <strong>algae</strong> called zooxanthellae. The coral and the <strong>algae</strong> have a <strong>symbiotic</strong> relationship, in which the <strong>algae</strong> gain a stable environment within the coral's tissues, while the coral receives nutrients produced by the <strong>algae</strong> through <strong>photosynthesis</strong>. By harnessing the sun's energy in this way, corals are able to grow rapidly and form vast reef structures, but are constrained to living near the water surface (4). While, on average, a zooxanthellate coral can obtain around 70 percent of its nutrient requirements from zooxanthellae <strong>photosynthesis</strong>, the coral may also feed on <strong>zooplankton</strong> (7).&nbsp;</p></p><h2><img src="/rimg/factsheet/Threats.png" class="heading" /></h2><p class="Threats"><p>The major threat to one third of the world’s reef-building corals is global climate change (8), with temperature extremes leading to coral bleaching. During bleaching, the <strong>symbiotic</strong> <strong>algae</strong> are expelled, resulting in weak and vulnerable corals that are susceptible to disease. Climate change may also increase the severity of <strong>El Niño</strong> events and storms with strong waves and currents which destroy coral reefs. Greater levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere also cause increased ocean acidification, which can reduce a coral’s ability to create its hard skeleton. In addition, rising sea levels may cause less sun to reach the coral, thereby decreasing <strong>photosynthesis</strong> (1).</p>
<p>Localised threats to <em>Ctenella chagius</em> include human development, such as industry, settlements, and agricultural and industrial pollution. Sediment which runs into the sea from soil erosion disrupts <strong>photosynthesis</strong>, and tourism and its related activities release pollutants into the water, whilst invasive species can disrupt the natural balance of the reef. Also, several methods of fishing, including dynamite, chemical and bottom trawling, can damage coral (1).</p></p><h2><img src="/rimg/factsheet/Conservation.png" class="heading" /></h2><p class="Conservation"><p>In addition to being listed on Appendix II of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES), which makes it an offence to trade <em>Ctenella chagius</em> without a permit, this coral falls within several Marine Protected Areas across its range. The recommended measures for preserving this species include more research into suitable habitats, population numbers and the threats to the species, as well as identifying, establishing and managing new protected areas, along with expanding existing protected areas. Disease also needs to be managed and controlled, and it is further recommended that colonies should be artificially grown as an extra safety measure (1).</p></p><h2><img src="/rimg/factsheet/FurtherInformation.png" class="heading" /></h2><p class="Find out more"><p>Learn about efforts to conserve <em>Ctenella chagius</em>:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Algae: </strong>simple plants that lack roots, stems and leaves but contain the green pigment chlorophyll. Most occur in marine and freshwater habitats.</li>
<li><strong>Colony/Colonies: </strong>a group of organisms living together.  Individuals in the group are not physiologically connected and may not be related, such as a colony of birds. Another meaning refers to organisms, such as bryozoans, which are composed of numerous genetically identical modules (also referred to as zooids or ‘individuals’), which are produced by budding and remain physiologically connected.</li>
<li><strong>El Niño: </strong>a natural phenomenon that happens every 4 to 12 years, and lasts for several months, when upwelling of cold, nutrient-rich water does not occur. This causes the warming of ocean surface water off the western coast of South America and causes die-offs of plankton and fish. It also affects Pacific jet stream winds, altering storm tracks and creating unusual weather patterns in various parts of the world.</li>
<li><strong>Endemic: </strong>a species or taxonomic group that is only found in one particular country or geographic area.</li>
<li><strong>Photosynthesis: </strong>metabolic process characteristic of plants in which carbon dioxide is broken down, using energy from sunlight absorbed by the green pigment chlorophyll. Organic compounds are made and oxygen is given off as a by-product.</li>
<li><strong>Polyp: </strong>typically sedentary soft-bodied component of cnidaria, a group of simple aquatic animals including the sea anemones, corals and jellyfish.  A polyp comprises a trunk that is fixed at the base, and a mouth that is placed at the opposite end of the trunk and is surrounded by tentacles.</li>
<li><strong>Symbiotic: </strong>describing a relationship in which two organisms form a close association, the term is now usually used only for associations that benefit both organisms (a mutualism).</li>
<li><strong>Zooplankton: </strong>tiny aquatic animals that drift with currents or swim weakly in water.</li>
