        <h2><img src="/rimg/factsheet/Status.png" class="heading" /></h2><p class="Status"><p>Carnaby’s black-cockatoo is classified as Endangered (EN) on the IUCN Red List (1) and is listed on Appendix II of CITES (6).</p></p><h2><img src="/rimg/factsheet/Description.png" class="heading" /></h2><p class="Description"><p>Carnaby’s black-cockatoo (<em>Calyptorhynchus latirostris</em>) is a large, black cockatoo <strong>endemic</strong> to south-western parts of Western Australia (2) (4) (7). Its feathers are mainly black to brownish-black, with off-white edges, and it has a wide white band on the tail (2) (3) (4) (7) (8). Carnaby’s black-cockatoo also has a whitish patch on the cheek, a short erectable crest on top of the head (2) (3), and a strong, curved bill, which has a flaky texture (4) (8).</p>
<p>There are a number of small differences between the male and female Carnaby’s black-cockatoo. The male has a dark greyish-black bill, a pink ring of skin around the eye and greyish-brown legs, whereas the female has a whitish bill, a grey eye ring and light grey to pinkish legs. The female Carnaby’s black-cockatoo also has a slightly larger white cheek patch than the male (2) (3) (4) (8).</p>
<p>The juvenile Carnaby’s black-cockatoo is similar in appearance to the adult female (2) (3) (4), but is best distinguished by its harsh call for food (4). Juveniles also have a smooth rather than flaky texture to the bill (4).</p>
<p>Carnaby’s black-cockatoo is often mistaken for the closely related Baudin’s black-cockatoo (<em>Calyptorhynchus baudinii</em>), and the two were previously considered to be the same species (4) (5). The only noticeable differences between the two species are that Carnaby’s black-cockatoo produces a slightly longer contact call and has a shorter upper <strong>mandible</strong>, giving rise to its alternative common name of short-billed black-cockatoo (2) (3) (4) (5) (8) (9). Carnaby’s black-cockatoo and Baudin’s black-cockatoo also have slightly different feeding habits and habitat preferences (7).</p>
<p>A fairly noisy bird, Carnaby’s black-cockatoo gives a variety of calls, the most common being a high-pitched, wailing ‘<em>whee-la</em>’ (2) (3). A harsh screech is also given in alarm, while young birds give a constant harsh wheezing sound (3).</p></p><h2><img src="/rimg/factsheet/Range.png" class="heading" /></h2><p class="Range"><p>Carnaby’s black-cockatoo is <strong>endemic</strong> to southwest Western Australia, where it is mainly found between Murchison River and Esperance, and inland to Coorow, Kellerberrin and Lake Cronin (2) (3) (4) (8) (10).</p></p><h2><img src="/rimg/factsheet/Habitat.png" class="heading" /></h2><p class="Habitat"><p>Carnaby’s black-cockatoo is a very mobile species and occupies two distinct habitats at different times of year (4) (7). It generally nests in dry eucalypt woodland, particularly those containing salmon gum (<em>Eucalyptus salmonophloia</em>) and wandoo (<em>Eucalyptus wandoo</em>) (3) (4) (7) (8) (10), with most breeding occurring in areas with an annual average rainfall of around 300 to 750 millimetres (3) (8) (10). These woodlands are situated near foraging habitat of shrubland and ‘kwongan heathland’, which is dominated by plants in the Proteaceae family, such as <em>Hakea</em>, <em>Banksia</em> and <em>Dryandra</em> species. These provide a food source for the breeding cockatoos (4) (8).</p>
<p>Outside of the breeding season, Carnaby’s black-cockatoo generally moves to wetter coastal areas, where it feeds in heathlands and scrublands (4) (8) (10). Plantations of introduced pines (<em>Pinus</em> spp.) have also become important feeding and roosting sites for Carnaby’s black-cockatoo during the non-breeding season (2) (4) (8). Although many populations of Carnaby’s black-cockatoo migrate, some may remain close to the breeding areas year-round (4).</p>
<p>Carnaby’s black-cockatoo is also an occasional visitor to forests containing marri (<em>Corymbia calophylla</em>), jarrah (<em>Eucalyptus marginata</em>) or karri (<em>Eucalyptus diversicolor</em>) (2) (4) (8), and will sometimes also forage on introduced weeds in pastures or along rail or road verges (4).</p></p><h2><img src="/rimg/factsheet/Biology.png" class="heading" /></h2><p class="Biology"><p>The diet of Carnaby’s black-cockatoo consists mainly of seeds from a variety of plants, including those of <em>Hakea</em>, <em>Banksia</em>, <em>Grevillea</em>, <em>Eucalyptus</em> and <em>Dryandra</em> species. It also occasionally takes fruit and nectar, as well as insect <strong>larvae</strong> that it finds on these plants. Carnaby’s black-cockatoo has also adapted to feed on non-native plants such as the wild radish (<em>Raphanus raphanistrum</em>), wild geranium (<em>Erodium</em> spp.) and pines (<em>Pinus</em> spp.) (2) (4) (7) (8). This species uses its short, powerful bill to break open the hard cases of fruit capsules and access the seeds (3) (8) (9).</p>
<p>Carnaby’s black-cockatoo is very sociable and can often be seen in groups of three or more, and even in large flocks of hundreds or sometimes thousands of birds outside of the breeding season (2) (3) (4) (7) (8).</p>
<p>This species mates from the age of four onwards (2) (3) (4) (8) (11), and typically pairs for life (2) (3) (4) (7). Carnaby’s black-cockatoo nests in hollows in large eucalypt trees, usually from two to ten or more metres above the ground (4) (8). The eggs are laid among wood chippings at the base of the hollow (4) (7), and breeding pairs may return to the same nesting site year on year (2) (4) (7). Fewer than half of the nest hollows in an area are likely to be occupied, due to fierce competition between the female cockatoos (2).</p>
<p>Carnaby’s black-cockatoo usually lays a clutch of two white or creamy white eggs, generally between July and October or November (2) (4) (7). The eggs are <strong>incubated</strong> by the female for 28 to 29 days (2) (4) (8), during which time the female is fed by the male (3) (7) (10). In most cases the second nestling dies within 48 hours of hatching, and only rarely do the adults raise more than one chick (2) (7) (8) (11). The breeding success of this species is dependent on the presence of suitable feeding areas close to its woodland nesting habitat (2) (4) (7) (8).</p>
<p>The young Carnaby’s black-cockatoo is initially brooded by the female for the first two weeks of life, after which both adults share in feeding it. After 10 to 12 weeks the young cockatoos fledge, but remain with the adults for up to a year, moving with them to the coast at the end of the breeding season to join larger flocks (4) (7) (8). Carnaby’s black-cockatoo is a long-lived species that may potentially live for 40 to 50 years in the wild (4) (10).</p></p><h2><img src="/rimg/factsheet/Threats.png" class="heading" /></h2><p class="Threats"><p>Carnaby’s black-cockatoo has undergone a rapid decline in the last century, vanishing from a third of its native range between 1970 and 1990 (2) (4). The main reason for this is the clearance of native vegetation for agriculture, which has severely reduced and fragmented this species’ habitat (4) (8). In some cases, parts of south-western Western Australia have lost over 90 percent of their original vegetation, with the remainder being scattered in numerous patches of varying size and quality (12).</p>
<p>In particular, the clearance of heathland and scrubland around its breeding sites has devastated the Carnaby’s black-cockatoo population (2) (4) (8). The adult cockatoos must not travel too far to gather sufficient food to satisfy the high energy demands of the developing nestlings. Where feeding habitat is scattered and fragmented, the adults are forced to forage further afield and for longer, resulting in higher mortality of the young, which may well starve before they can fledge (3) (4) (10). Remaining habitat patches are also being increasingly degraded by weed invasion and by an increase in soil salinity, caused by changing land use practices (2) (4) (8) (13).</p>
<p>The breeding habitat of Carnaby’s black-cockatoo has also been extensively cleared (2) (4) (13). In addition, Carnaby’s black-cockatoo is losing nesting sites as nesting trees are not regenerating, mainly due to grazing by sheep and rabbits (2) (3) (4) (8) (13). Carnaby’s black-cockatoo is also facing increasing competition with other birds and with introduced bees for nest hollows. In particular, species such as the galah (<em>Cacatua roseicapilla) </em>and the western corella (<em>Cacatua&nbsp;pastinator</em>) are invading the range of Carnaby’s black-cockatoo and out-competing it for resources (2) (4) (7) (8) (10).</p>
<p>Although non-native pines provide a reliable food source for Carnaby’s black-cockatoo outside of the breeding season, these pines are now reaching maturity and will eventually be harvested. This could potentially lead to a food shortage for the cockatoos (2) (4) (13).</p>
<p>Carnaby’s black-cockatoo is particularly vulnerable to changes in land use due to the fact it migrates and uses a variety of habitats for breeding and foraging throughout the year (4). Its long-term pair bonds and high fidelity to its traditional nesting sites may also mean that the birds are slow to disperse after habitat disturbances (2).</p>
<p>Carnaby’s black-cockatoo is also susceptible to collisions with vehicles (2) (7) (12) (14), particularly as more habitat is cleared and remaining habitat patches are crossed by roads and railways (2). In addition, its eggs and chicks are often illegally poached due to the species’ popularity and high value in the avicultural trade. Although domestic demand for Carnaby’s black-cockatoo has declined, poaching for illegal export still occurs, and nest hollows are often damaged in the process, making them unsuitable for future nesting (2) (4) (8) (10) (13).</p>
<p>In recent years, severe weather events and outbreaks of disease have caused many fatalities of Carnaby’s black-cockatoos. It is feared that climate change may increase the frequency of extreme weather events such as heat waves and storms, with potentially devastating effects on the already vulnerable cockatoo population (14).</p></p><h2><img src="/rimg/factsheet/Conservation.png" class="heading" /></h2><p class="Conservation"><p>Carnaby’s black-cockatoo is legally protected in Australia (2) (4), and international trade in this species should be strictly controlled under its listing on Appendix II of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) (6). A Recovery Plan has been prepared for Carnaby’s black-cockatoo, and in 1999 a Carnaby’s Black-Cockatoo Recovery Team was appointed to coordinate conservation efforts for this species (8).</p>
<p>A number of conservation measures are already in place for Carnaby’s black-cockatoo. For example, a captive breeding programme is underway so that if extinction occurs in the wild, individuals are available for reintroductions. Injured wild cockatoos are also rehabilitated and incorporated into the breeding programme. Perth Zoo is maintaining a stud book for captive Carnaby’s black-cockatoos, and microchipping and DNA analysis are being used to ensure that all captive birds have been legally obtained (2) (4) (8) (13). Captive birds are also used to help educate the public about the threats to the Carnaby’s black-cockatoo population (8).</p>
<p>Further conservation measures underway for Carnaby’s black-cockatoo include the protection of key areas of habitat, the protection and maintenance of nest sites, the re-establishment of feeding habitat and the development of habitat corridors linking breeding and feeding sites (2) (4) (7) (10) (13). Damaged nest hollows have also been repaired (7) (8) (10). Some schools have become involved by replanting native vegetation for Carnaby’s black-cockatoo (8), and groups such as ‘Men of the Trees’ have received grants to re-establish habitats within the Northern Wheatbelt area of Western Australia (10).</p>
<p>Birds Australia (now BirdLife Australia) has been leading recovery efforts for the Carnaby’s black-cockatoo, and in 2006 introduced the ‘Great Cocky Count’, a survey completed by the community to map Carnaby’s black-cockatoo abundance and estimate the population size (7) (15).</p>
<p>Other recommended conservation measures for this species include monitoring rates of habitat loss and degradation, determining the extent of illegal poaching, continuing habitat restoration and population monitoring, excluding livestock and rabbits to promote tree regeneration, and protecting nesting trees (2). It will also be vital to create and maintain more habitat corridors to link feeding and breeding areas, helping the cockatoos to move between food sources and breed more successfully (2) (4) (12).</p>
<p>The 2011 Great Cocky Count suggested a worrying decline in the Carnaby’s black-cockatoo population between 2010 and 2011. Long-term monitoring is needed to better understand the population trends of this large but highly threatened cockatoo (15).</p></p><h2><img src="/rimg/factsheet/FurtherInformation.png" class="heading" /></h2><p class="Find out more"><p>Find out more about Carnaby’s black-cockatoo and its conservation:</p>
