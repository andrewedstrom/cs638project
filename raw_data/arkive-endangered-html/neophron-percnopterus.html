        <h2><img src="/rimg/factsheet/Status.png" class="heading" /></h2><p class="Status"><p>Classified as Endangered (EN) on the IUCN Red List (1) and listed on Appendix II of CITES (3).</p></p><h2><img src="/rimg/factsheet/Description.png" class="heading" /></h2><p class="Description"><p>A small vulture with a very large range, the Egyptian vulture has an unmistakable appearance.  Adults have largely white to pale grey plumage, which contrasts markedly with the black <strong>flight-feathers</strong> and the bold yellow bare skin on the face (2).  The long, narrow bill has a yellow base and terminates with a black tip (2) (4).  The tail is short and wedge-shaped.  The legs may be greyish-white, pink or pale yellow.  Two <strong>subspecies</strong> of the Egyptian vulture are recognised; <i>Neophron percnopterus ginginianus</i> is slightly smaller than <i>Neophron percnopterus percnopterus</i> and has an entirely yellow bill.  Juveniles have much darker plumage than the adults (2), and may be grey-brown, brown or blackish-brown (4).</p></p><h2><img src="/rimg/factsheet/Range.png" class="heading" /></h2><p class="Range"><p>The Egyptian vulture has a very large range.  <i>N. p. percnopterus</i> occurs in southern Europe, east to Central Asia and north-west India, and south through North Africa, Arabia and the <strong>Sahel</strong> zone to northern Tanzania, south-western Angola and north-western Namibia.  Isolated populations also occur in the Canary Islands and the Cape Verde Islands (2).  <i>N. p. ginginianus</i> can be found in Nepal and India, except for the north-western parts (2).  Most Egyptian vulture populations migrate for winter to the south of the Sahara, but some remain on their breeding grounds (4) (5).</p></p><h2><img src="/rimg/factsheet/Habitat.png" class="heading" /></h2><p class="Habitat"><p>The Egyptian vulture generally inhabits open, arid areas and can be found in <strong>steppe</strong>, desert, pastures and cereal fields, but requires rocky sites for nesting (2).  It is often found near human habitations, for example, near or in towns (2), around rubbish dumps, slaughterhouses and fishing ports (4).</p></p><h2><img src="/rimg/factsheet/Biology.png" class="heading" /></h2><p class="Biology"><p>While the Egyptian vulture is normally a solitary bird, or is seen in pairs, large groups of vultures may congregate at feeding sites or at communal night roosts (2), usually on cliffs (4).  Each day, these vultures may travel up to 80 kilometres in search of food (2), flying with strong, deep wing beats or soaring whilst surveying the ground (4).  The Egyptian vulture is an opportunist and will feed on a huge range of food that it encounters.  <strong>Carrion</strong> comprises the majority of its diet, including dead birds, small mammals, livestock and large wild animals (2).  It will often feed just on the scraps of large carcasses after other vultures have consumed the majority of the soft flesh (2) (4).   This undiscriminating bird will also scavenge on a wide range of organic waste, including rotting fruit, vegetables and even excrement (2), and will sometimes prey on small animals, particularly those weak or injured, such as rabbits, chicks, spawning or dying fish, and some insects (2).  The Egyptian vulture also consumes eggs and, most remarkably, will throw stones at them to break open the shell – an incredible and rare example of tool-use in birds (6).</p><p>The Egyptian vulture is largely a <strong>monogamous</strong> bird, and undertakes a courtship which includes undulating flights and mutual preening (4).  The pair will construct a nest on a cliff, either in a cave or on a ledge protected by an overhang, or very occasionally in a tree.  The nest is built of sticks and lined with masses of wool, hair, rags or the remains of food, and measures an impressive 1.5 metres across.  Normally two eggs are laid, which are incubated for 42 days.   Both parents incubate the eggs and feed the chicks until they fledge at the age of 70 to 85 days.  Egyptian vultures become sexually mature at four to five years of age and are known to live for up to 37 years in captivity (2).</p></p><h2><img src="/rimg/factsheet/Threats.png" class="heading" /></h2><p class="Threats"><p>Numerous threats are pushing this Endangered bird towards extinction.  In Africa, declines have been caused by the loss of wild <strong>ungulate</strong> populations and, in some areas, overgrazing by livestock (5).  In Europe, the Egyptian vulture has been suffering severe, long-term declines; the result of disturbance, lead poisoning from gun shot, direct poisoning and electrocution by powerlines, as well as regulations introduced within the European Union to control the disposal of animal carcasses, which have greatly reduced food availability for this scavenger.  In addition, Avian pox has been cited as the cause of Egyptian vulture deaths in Bulgaria (5).  In India, diclofenac, an anti-inflammatory drug often used for livestock, is likely to be the source of recent and extremely rapid declines in Egyptian vulture populations (5) (7).  This drug, which is also responsible for devastating declines in other vulture species, poisons vultures when they feed on the flesh of treated livestock (8).</p></p><h2><img src="/rimg/factsheet/Conservation.png" class="heading" /></h2><p class="Conservation"><p>Throughout its range, the Egyptian vulture occurs in a number of protected areas, as well as being the subject of monitoring, supplementary feeding programmes and campaigns against the illegal use of poisons (5).  In 2006, manufacture of the veterinary form of the drug diclofenac was banned by the Indian, Nepali and Pakistani governments (9) (10).  While this was a remarkable step forward in vulture conservation, the drug remains widely available and the human form of the drug is sometimes being used to treat livestock instead (9).    Many more measures may be necessary if the long-term survival of the Egyptian vulture is to be assured.  BirdLife International recommends relaxing European Union regulations with regards to the disposal of animal carcasses, lobbying for the ban of diclofenac throughout the species range, and protecting nest sites, as just some of the measures which would benefit the Egyptian vulture (5).</p></p><h2><img src="/rimg/factsheet/FurtherInformation.png" class="heading" /></h2><p class="Find out more"><p>For further information on vulture declines in Asia see:</p><p><ul><li>Vulture Rescue: <br/><a href="http://www.vulturerescue.org" target="_blank">www.vulturerescue.org</a></li></ul></p><p>For more information on this and other bird species please see:</p><ul><li>BirdLife International: <br/><a href="http://www.birdlife.org" target="_blank">http://www.birdlife.org</a></li></ul></p><h2><img src="/rimg/factsheet/Authentication.png" class="heading" /></h2><p class="AuthenticatioModel"><p>Authenticated (10/06/08) by Dr. Richard Cuthbert, Research Biologist, RSPB. <br/><a href="http://www.vulturerescue.org" target="_blank">http://www.vulturerescue.org</a></p></p><h2><img src="/rimg/factsheet/Glossary.png" class="heading" /></h2>
