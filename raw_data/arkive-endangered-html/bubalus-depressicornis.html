        <h2><img src="/rimg/factsheet/Status.png" class="heading" /></h2><p class="Status"><p>Classified as Endangered (EN C1+2a) on the IUCN Red List 2003 (1) and listed on Appendix I of CITES (3).</p></p><h2><img src="/rimg/factsheet/Description.png" class="heading" /></h2><p class="Description"><p>This small water buffalo is found in Indonesia (2). Indeed, ‘anoa’ is the Sulawesi word for ‘buffalo’. This species is characterised by its stocky body and thick, dark skin which is darker in males than females (4). The body is sparsely covered with brown to blackish hair and the forelegs bear white or yellowish white hair. The nape and throat are also a pale yellow-white colour (4). Adults bear horns that point backwards and are flat and wrinkled (2). Males’ horns grow to about 30 cm in length, while females’ horns are slightly smaller at about 25 cm (in length) (5). Juveniles are brown in colour with a woolly coat which is lost as they mature (2).</p></p><h2><img src="/rimg/factsheet/Range.png" class="heading" /></h2><p class="Range"><p>This species is <strong>endemic</strong> to the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, where its range extends for about 5,000 km² (2).</p></p><h2><img src="/rimg/factsheet/Habitat.png" class="heading" /></h2><p class="Habitat"><p>As its name suggests this species inhabits lowland forests. It also occurs in swampy areas and in the past was recorded from coastal areas (1). Lowland anoa are also found in mountainous areas at high elevations (1).</p></p><h2><img src="/rimg/factsheet/Biology.png" class="heading" /></h2><p class="Biology"><p>This small water buffalo is herbivorous and feeds on aquatic plants, ferns, grasses, saplings, fallen fruit, palm, and ginger (6). Like other water buffalo this species wallows and bathes in pools of water and mud, and drinks from salt licks, pools of mineral spring water or from sea water in order to obtain minerals (1). </p><p>

Lowland anoas are usually solitary, though mother and daughter pairs are common and small groups of up to five individuals have been recorded (5). Research indicates that males are territorial as they have been observed marking trees with their horns and scratching the soil after urinating (5). Breeding occurs throughout the year and, after a gestation period of 275-315 days, females give birth to a single offspring (2) (6).
</p></p><h2><img src="/rimg/factsheet/Threats.png" class="heading" /></h2><p class="Threats"><p>The population of this buffalo has declined significantly. The major threats are hunting and habitat loss, which is occurring in Sulawesi due to the draining of marshland, agricultural development and logging (1). Anoas are hunted for their desirable meat which is sold in local markets. In addition, the skull and the horns are made into trophies, souvenirs, and used in traditional medicine (4). </p><p> 
The threats of hunting and habitat loss go hand in hand, for as the forests are opened up for development, the wildlife in the forest becomes more accessible to poachers (2). The increase in the availability of weapons has also made the extent of hunting much greater (2). The lowland anoa has retreated into more remote areas of the forest due to these threats (1). 
</p></p><h2><img src="/rimg/factsheet/Conservation.png" class="heading" /></h2><p class="Conservation"><p>Sulawesi’s forests have the highest level of mammal <strong>endemism</strong> in Asia, and there are several conservation programmes underway on the island (7). The lowland anoa is fully protected under Indonesian law, though there is concern that this is not enforced well enough, as hunting continues even inside protected reserves (1). This water buffalo does occur in several protected areas on the island but, unlike many wild cattle of Southeast Asia, this species depends mainly on undisturbed forest (1). </p><p>

There are a number of lowland anoa held in captivity, though the breeding programme has been greatly hindered by confusion surrounding this species’ classification (1). At present, genetic and morphological studies are underway, which will hopefully clarify this issue and allow breeding programmes to develop (1).  This species is considered endangered by the IUCN and will face extinction in the wild in the near future unless hunting is controlled and the Sulawesi forests are protected from further development (1) (4).
