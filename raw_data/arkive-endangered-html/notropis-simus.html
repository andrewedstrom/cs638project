        <h2><img src="/rimg/factsheet/Status.png" class="heading" /></h2><p class="Status"><p>The bluntnose shiner is classified as Endangered (EN) on the IUCN Red List (1).</p></p><h2><img src="/rimg/factsheet/Description.png" class="heading" /></h2><p class="Description"><p>The bluntnose shiner (<em>Notropis simus</em>) is a small, freshwater minnow belonging to the Cyprinidae family (3), a diverse group of fish comprising over 2,000 species (4). It is silvery with a grey to green-brown underside, and is characterised by a scattering of melanophores (pigment-containing cells) on its head and sides.</p>
<p>This species’ common name, bluntnose shiner, refers to the ‘shimmering’ silver streak that runs from the head to the tail, as well as its distinctive blunt snout. Interestingly, during the <strong>spawning</strong> season, the male bluntnose shiner develops very small <strong>tubercules</strong> on its head and <strong>pectoral fins</strong> (3) (5).</p></p><h2><img src="/rimg/factsheet/Range.png" class="heading" /></h2><p class="Range"><p>Today, the range of the bluntnose shiner isrestricted to approximately 300 kilometres of the Pecos River in eastern New Mexico (6). However, historically the subspecies <em>Notropis simus simus</em>, which is now unfortunately extinct, was also found in the upper Rio Grande of Texas, New Mexico and Mexico (1).</p></p><h2><img src="/rimg/factsheet/Habitat.png" class="heading" /></h2><p class="Habitat"><p>The bluntnose shiner is found in main river channels, at depths of 17 to 41 centimetres, where the substrates are shifting sand and small gravel (3) (5).</p></p><h2><img src="/rimg/factsheet/Biology.png" class="heading" /></h2><p class="Biology"><p>The diet of the bluntnose shiner is believed to primarily consist of <strong>algae</strong>, terrestrial <strong>invertebrates</strong> and <strong>detritus</strong> (3). The maximum lifespan of the bluntnose shiner is about three years (7); however, most individuals are unlikely to survive for more than two years (5).</p>
<p>The <strong>spawning</strong> season of the bluntnose shiner extends from May to September. However, it is not known whether individuals <strong>spawn</strong> several times each season or just once.The bluntnose shiner is a <strong>pelagic</strong>-broadcast spawner, meaning the eggs and sperm are released into open water for external <strong>fertilisation</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Spawning</strong> behaviour begins with the male pursuing a female and nudging the female’s abdominal region. Once the female is ready to <strong>spawn</strong>, the male wraps around the female’s body and <strong>fertilises</strong> the eggs as they are released. The eggs are semi-buoyant, causing them to be dispersed widely by the water current. The eggs develop rapidly, hatching into <strong>larvae</strong> within 24 to 48 hours after <strong>fertilisation</strong> (8).</p></p><h2><img src="/rimg/factsheet/Threats.png" class="heading" /></h2><p class="Threats"><p>A study by the University of New Mexico showed that numbers of the bluntnose shiner had reduced significantly between 1939 and the 1990s (3). Several factors have contributed to this decline. Most importantly, the construction of dams and reservoirs has blocked the upstream movements of the bluntnose shiner into formerly occupied habitats (5). Water degradation from agricultural pollutants has also reduced numbers (3).</p>
<p>In addition, changes to the Pecos River channel from the building of canals, as well as the increased growth of non-native plant species, mainly tamarisk (<em>Tamarix</em> <em>pentandra</em>), has reduced the suitability of some stream reaches for the bluntnose shiner (5).</p></p><h2><img src="/rimg/factsheet/Conservation.png" class="heading" /></h2><p class="Conservation"><p>The bluntnose shiner was listed as Threatened by the US federal government in 1987, facilitating the introduction of a five year research program to look at the measures necessary for the protection of the remaining populations (5).</p>
<p>This has led to strict maintenance of the water released from reservoirs along the Pecos River, to make sure there are no large, ‘block’ releases of water into the river and the water flow remains semi-natural. This should reduce the negative effects of changing water levels on the life history stages of the bluntnose shiner. The program has also enabled research into the effect of non-native fish and water quality on the bluntnose shiner. The goal of this research effort is to hopefully conserve the remaining bluntnose shiner population and the native fish community of the Pecos River (5).</p></p><h2><img src="/rimg/factsheet/FurtherInformation.png" class="heading" /></h2><p class="Find out more"><p>Find out more about the conservation of the bluntnose shiner:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Algae: </strong>simple plants that lack roots, stems and leaves but contain the green pigment chlorophyll. Most occur in marine and freshwater habitats.</li>
<li><strong>Detritus: </strong>litter formed from fragments of dead material.</li>
<li><strong>Fertilisation: </strong>the fusion of gametes (male and female reproductive cells) to produce an embryo, which grows into a new individual.</li>
<li><strong>Invertebrates: </strong>animals with no backbone, such as insects, crustaceans, worms, molluscs, spiders.</li>
<li><strong>Larvae: </strong>stage in an animal’s lifecycle after it hatches from the egg. Larvae are typically very different in appearance to adults; they are able to feed and move around but usually are unable to reproduce.</li>
<li><strong>Pectoral fins: </strong>in fish, the pair of fins that are found on either side of the body just behind the gills. They are generally used for balancing and braking.</li>
<li><strong>Pelagic: </strong>relating to or inhabiting the open ocean.</li>
<li><strong>Spawning: </strong>the production or depositing of large quantities of eggs in water.</li>
<li><strong>Tubercle: </strong>a small, rounded, wart-like bump on the skin or on a bone.</li>
