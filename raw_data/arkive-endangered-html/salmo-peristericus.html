        <h2><img src="/rimg/factsheet/Status.png" class="heading" /></h2><p class="Status"><p><em>Salmo peristericus</em> is classified as Endangered (EN) on the IUCN Red List (1).</p></p><h2><img src="/rimg/factsheet/Description.png" class="heading" /></h2><p class="Description"><p>A small, slender-bodied fish, <em>Salmo peristericus</em> is very similar in appearance to other Balkan species in the <strong>genus</strong> <em>Salmo</em>. It is distinguished mainly by having a low number of gill rakers (the bony, finger-like projections on the gill arch), compared with other species (2) (3) (4).</p>
<p><em>Salmo peristericus</em> has small, eye-like, black spots evenly distributed along the length of the body, mainly above the <strong>lateral line</strong> (2) (3). Black spots are also present on much of the <strong>dorsal fin</strong> (3), and there is a small black spot on the hard bony flap, the ‘operculum’, which covers and protects the gills (2) (4). Numerous, small red spots are also scattered along the sides of the body and on the <strong>dorsal fin</strong> (2) (3). The edges of the <strong>dorsal</strong> and <strong>anal</strong> fins are typically pale or white (3).&nbsp;</p></p><h2><img src="/rimg/factsheet/Range.png" class="heading" /></h2><p class="Range"><p><em>Salmo peristericus</em> is thought to be restricted to the Agios Germanos stream (1) (5), and to Brajcinska Reka, which both flow into Lake Megali Prespa, in the Prespa Lakes region of north-western Greece and south-west Macedonia (3).</p>
<p>This species may also occur in two additional streams leading into Lake Megali Prespa, although the presence of <em>Salmo peristericus</em> in these streams currently remains uncertain (3).</p></p><h2><img src="/rimg/factsheet/Habitat.png" class="heading" /></h2><p class="Habitat"><p>Occurring in a small number of mountain streams with gravel bottoms in the Prespa Lakes region, <em>Salmo peristericus</em> is typically found where the water is cool and well-oxygenated (1) (2).</p></p><h2><img src="/rimg/factsheet/Biology.png" class="heading" /></h2><p class="Biology"><p><em>Salmo peristericus</em> feeds on fish, insects and a variety of other small organisms that inhabit the stream bed (2). Originally believed to inhabit lakes and return to streams only to <strong>spawn</strong>, <em>Salmo peristericus</em> is now considered to be completely restricted to its mountain stream habitat. This species lays its eggs around November (4).</p></p><h2><img src="/rimg/factsheet/Threats.png" class="heading" /></h2><p class="Threats"><p>The population of <em>Salmo peristericus</em> is threatened by habitat degradation, largely due to pollution, overgrazing of streamside vegetation and erosion, which destroy this species’ <strong>spawning</strong> areas and reduces the water quality of the streams (1) (2). Increased sediment in streams and fragmentation of this species’ vital habitat are also contributing to the declining population of <em>Salmo peristericus </em>(2).</p>
<p>Climate change is an emerging threat to this species, and may negatively affect the health of the <em>Salmo peristericus</em> population in the future (2). Lowering of the water levels through extraction and drought is also a threat to this species (1) (2) (3). Poaching may also be placing increased pressure on the population of <em>Salmo peristericus </em>(1) (2).&nbsp;</p></p><h2><img src="/rimg/factsheet/Conservation.png" class="heading" /></h2><p class="Conservation"><p>Part of <em>Salmo peristericus’s</em> range is encompassed by a National Park, and angling in the region is regulated according to the National law (1).</p>
<p>A Species Action Plan has been developed for <em>Salmo peristericus</em> to establish the key priorities and actions needed to ensure the conservation of this species. In particular, the Action Plan aims to develop a long-term monitoring scheme to research the health of the remaining populations of <em>Salmo peristericus</em>, as well as health of the streams in which it is found (2).</p>
<p>In addition, the Action Plan aims to identify the most important threats to this species, and to implement a number of measures to mitigate these threats. Included in the recommended measures for the conservation of <em>Salmo peristericus</em> is setting up a wardening and monitoring scheme. This will assess the impact of poaching and angling on this species and raise the awareness of its importance, and should be conducted in association with local partnerships and the community (2).</p>
<p>Regulations for angling, including new local license, bag limits, size limits and catch and release policies have also been proposed to protect the <em>Salmo peristericus</em> population, while new regulations regarding water removal for irrigation and hydropower stations may also be considered (2).</p>
<p>It is also suggested that <em>Salmo peristericus</em> be designated a ‘flagship species’ in the Prespa National Park, as part of a public awareness campaign to raise the profile of this threatened species (2). &nbsp;&nbsp;</p></p><h2><img src="/rimg/factsheet/FurtherInformation.png" class="heading" /></h2><p class="Find out more"><p>Find out more about the conservation of <em>Salmo peristericus</em>:</p>

<li><strong>Anal fin: </strong>in fish, an unpaired fin on the under surface of a fish, behind the anus. </li>
<li><strong>Dorsal fin: </strong>the unpaired fin found on the back of the body of fish, or the raised structure on the back of most cetaceans.</li>
<li><strong>Genus: </strong>a category used in taxonomy, which is below ‘family’ and above ‘species’. A genus tends to contain species that have characteristics in common. The genus forms the first part of a ‘binomial’ Latin species name; the second part is the specific name.</li>
<li><strong>Lateral line: </strong>a row of receptors that can detect movement via vibrations in water. The receptors are typically embedded in the skin, and in fish they form a line along the sides of the body. </li>
<li><strong>Spawning: </strong>the production or depositing of large quantities of eggs in water.</li>
