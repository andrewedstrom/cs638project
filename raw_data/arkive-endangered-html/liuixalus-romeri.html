        <h2><img src="/rimg/factsheet/Status.png" class="heading" /></h2><p class="Status"><p>Romer’s treefrog is classified as Endangered (EN) on the IUCN Red List (1).</p></p><h2><img src="/rimg/factsheet/Description.png" class="heading" /></h2><p class="Description"><p>One of the world’s tiniest frogs and the smallest amphibian to be recorded in Hong Kong (2) (3), Romer’s treefrog (<em>Liuixalus romeri</em>) was discovered in 1952 in a small, remote cave on Lamma Island. Following the collapse of the cave roof soon after its discovery, Romer’s treefrog disappeared and was presumed extinct for nearly 30 years until it was rediscovered in 1984 (3) (4).</p>
<p>This diminutive, well-camouflaged species is generally tan to pale brown, with a dark brown or black X-shaped marking on the back (2) (3) (4).</p></p><h2><img src="/rimg/factsheet/Range.png" class="heading" /></h2><p class="Range"><p><strong>Endemic</strong> to Hong Kong, Romer’s treefrog is naturally distributed on the four islands of Lamma, Lantau, Chek Lap Kok and Po Toi (1) (2) (3) (4).&nbsp;</p>
<p>The construction of a new airport on Chek Lap Kok in the 1990s led to most of the population of Romer’s treefrog on this island being <strong>translocated</strong> to eight new sites on Hong Kong Island and the New Territories, including Tsiu Hang Special Area, Tai Lam Country Park and Tai Po Kau Nature Reserve (1) (3).</p></p><h2><img src="/rimg/factsheet/Habitat.png" class="heading" /></h2><p class="Habitat"><p>Despite its common name, Romer’s treefrog is typically found on the ground or in low bushes (4). This species inhabits forests, plantations and other well-wooded areas, close to water sources such as streams and marshes (1) (2).</p>
<p>Romer’s treefrog breeds in temporary pools, marshes, small pools in streams, and ponds (1) (2) (4). It has also been known to use man-made excavations, gutters and small water-filled containers (1) (4).&nbsp;</p></p><h2><img src="/rimg/factsheet/Biology.png" class="heading" /></h2><p class="Biology"><p>Romer’s treefrog breeds between early March and September (2) (3) (4). The male attracts the female by emitting a metallic, staccato, cricket-like mating call, from a position close to a pool or other water source (2) (3). Generally, mating occurs on warm, rainy nights, with the female attaching up to 120 eggs in small clusters to submerged sticks or leaves. The eggs are then <strong>fertilised</strong> by the male (3). The small, free-swimming tadpoles of Romer’s treefrog <strong>metamorphose</strong> to adults after four to six weeks (2) (3).&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>A predominantly <strong>nocturnal</strong> species, Romer’s treefrog feeds on small <strong>arthropods</strong>, such as termites, which it captures on the ground (2).&nbsp;</p></p><h2><img src="/rimg/factsheet/Threats.png" class="heading" /></h2><p class="Threats"><p>Romer’s treefrog is primarily threatened by human disturbance and habitat destruction (1) (2) (5), while habitat degradation due to pollution is also a major threat to this species (5). The eggs and tadpoles of Romer’s treefrog are vulnerable to predation by the introduced mosquitofish (<em>Gambusia affinis</em>), as well as to predation by other frogs (2) (5).</p>
<p>The population of Romer’s treefrog has declined since its rediscovery, partly due to immense pressure on the remaining populations from human development. As a result, Romer’s treefrog became one of the first amphibians to be part of a successful <strong>translocation</strong> programme (2) (3) (4).</p>
<p>The construction of an airport on Chek Lap Kok Island extirpated most of the Romer’s treefrog population there. However, successful <strong>translocation</strong> of many individuals from the island prior to the airport’s development has meant that the total population size of Romer’s treefrog has been more or less maintained (1) (4).</p>
<p>Climate change may also become a significant threat to Romer’s treefrog in future. Climate change has already been implicated in earlier <strong>spawning</strong> dates and breeding migrations in a number of amphibian species. Climate models also predict that many amphibians will suffer huge population declines or extinctions due to a warmer and more extreme climate. It is also likely that climate change will facilitate the spread of disease, such as the chytrid fungus <em>Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis</em> (6).</p></p><h2><img src="/rimg/factsheet/Conservation.png" class="heading" /></h2><p class="Conservation"><p>Romer’s treefrog is one of three amphibian species listed under the Hong Kong Wild Animals Protection Ordinance, which prohibits the hunting, wilful disturbance, possession, sale or export of this species (2) (3) (4). A major population stronghold for Romer’s treefrog, Ngong Ping in Lantau, has been designated a Site of Special Scientific Interest (1) (2). Many of the key sites for this species on Lamma Island fall within a Conservation Area (2).</p>
<p>A comprehensive captive breeding programme for this species began in 1992, when the population of Romer’s treefrog on Chek Lap Kok was imminently threatened by the construction of a new airport. Extensive collections were made from the island, and the rescued frogs were maintained in a breeding and management programme at The University of Hong Kong. Thirty individuals were also sent to Melbourne Zoo in Australia, to establish a second breeding population (1) (3) (4) (5) (7).&nbsp;</p>
<p>The aim of the captive breeding programme was to maintain a breeding population of Romer’s treefrog which could be released back into suitable sites the wild. In 1993 and 1994, adult frogs and tadpoles from captive populations were relocated to eight new sites. Seven out of the eight areas where this species was introduced still harbour significant populations of Romer’s treefrog (3), and an ongoing monitoring programme records the success of the introduced populations each year during the breeding season (5).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>A large population of Romer’s treefrog in Sok Kwu Wan has also been the focus of concerted conservation action, with the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries, and Conservation, the University of Hong Kong and the Kadoorie Farm and Botanical Garden working together to protect the species from slope stabilisation work which threatens to destroy its habitat (1) (3).</p></p><h2><img src="/rimg/factsheet/FurtherInformation.png" class="heading" /></h2><p class="Find out more"><p>Find out more about Romer’s treefrog:</p>
