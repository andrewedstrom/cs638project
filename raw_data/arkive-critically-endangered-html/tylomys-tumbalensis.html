Most of what is known about this particular species comes from a single immature specimen collected by the U.S. National Museum in 1895 (2) (3), and the Tumbala climbing rat is said to resemble a larger version of the common black rat (<em>Rattus rattus</em>) (4).</p>
<p>The Tumbala climbing rat has long, thick, woolly fur (3) and is greyish-brown in colour (2) (3) (4) with darker areas on the top of its head and a blackish streak along its back (2). The sides are washed brownish (2) while the underside tends to be lighter shades, such as a buffy-grey or creamy-white (2) (3) (4).</p>
<p>The Tumbala climbing rat has a shiny tail (3), which is longer than the length of its body (5) and is black close to the body but becomes yellowish-white from about halfway down right to the tip (2) (3). The slender tail is naked or sparsely haired (3) (4) (6), and large scales form rings along its length (3). The Tumbala climbing rat’s ears are large, naked and blackish (2) (3) (4).</p>
<p>Although climbing rats are generally rather slow moving animals, they are able to demonstrate great agility and speed as they move through the vines and branches of their forest home (3). The Tumbala climbing rat has a specialised hind foot which is well adapted for climbing among trees (4) (6).</p>
<p>A specimen of the <em>Tylomys</em> <strong>genus</strong> was said to have emitted cat-like spitting sounds as well as pig-like shrieks in captivity (7).</p></p><h2><img src="/rimg/factsheet/Range.png" class="heading" /></h2><p class="Range"><p>The Tumbala climbing rat is known to only live in a single region of southern Mexico, a town called Tumbalá in the state of Chiapas, from which this species gets its name (1) (3) (4) (8). This rodent is only found in an area of less than 100 square kilometres (1).</p></p><h2><img src="/rimg/factsheet/Habitat.png" class="heading" /></h2><p class="Habitat"><p>Species within the <em>Tylomys</em> <strong>genus</strong>, such as the Tumbala climbing rat, generally prefer areas of dense tropical forest (1) (4), and are often found on and around rocky ledges and cliffs (4). The single locality at which the Tumbala climbing rat is known to live has an elevation of 1,700 metres (3).</p></p><h2><img src="/rimg/factsheet/Biology.png" class="heading" /></h2><p class="Biology"><p>Very little is known about the specific biology of the Tumbala climbing rat, as only one specimen has ever been captured, and this was an immature male in 1895 (2). However, individuals of the <em>Tylomys</em> <strong>genus</strong> are reported to be <strong>nocturnal</strong> (3), and the rat’s modified hind feet indicate that it is an <strong>arboreal</strong> species (4) (6) (9).</p>
<p>Female <em>Tylomys</em> reach sexual maturity at about 90 days and males at around 144 days (10). Pregnancy in these rodents lasts for about 40 days, with each litter comprising between one and four young (11).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>There is no information available on the diet of the Tumbala climbing rat. However, a captive Peters’s climbing rat (<em>Tylomys nudicaudus</em>), a close relative of the Tumbala climbing rat, was fed on bird seed, mouse breeder food and sometimes even lettuce and apples, suggesting that the <strong>genus</strong> is <strong>herbivorous</strong> (7).</p></p><h2><img src="/rimg/factsheet/Threats.png" class="heading" /></h2><p class="Threats"><p>The fact that, worldwide, the Tumbala climbing rat is only known from one small Mexican town means that any destruction in this area will have a severe impact on the rat’s numbers. The area of Mexico where this species lives has been significantly affected by deforestation, leaving only very small areas of the original dense tropical forest for the native species. This deforestation is the result of agricultural development in the area (1).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is very difficult to gather a complete picture of the Tumbala climbing rat’s conservation status, as <em>Tylomys</em> species are reported to be particularly hard to catch (7). These rodents are so large that they have been known to break out of cages and traps set for them (12). The last known sighting of this Mexican tree-dwelling climbing rat was in 1968 (13).</p></p><h2><img src="/rimg/factsheet/FurtherInformation.png" class="heading" /></h2><p class="Find out more"><p>Find out more about the Tumbala climbing rat:</p>
