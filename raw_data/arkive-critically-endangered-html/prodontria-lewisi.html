        <h2><img src="/rimg/factsheet/Status.png" class="heading" /></h2><p class="Status"><p>Classified as Critically Endangered (CR) by the IUCN Red List 2007 (1).</p></p><h2><img src="/rimg/factsheet/Description.png" class="heading" /></h2><p class="Description"><p>The Cromwell chafer is a Critically Endangered beetle found at just one site in Cromwell, New Zealand. It is a flightless beetle that belongs to the same family as dung beetles. This large beetle has pale reddish-brown wing cases (elytra) which are strongly convex and feature deep lines passing along their length.  Females are longer and wider than males, but males have longer lower legs (tibiae) and larger hind feet (2).</p></p><h2><img src="/rimg/factsheet/Range.png" class="heading" /></h2><p class="Range"><p>This beetle is <strong>endemic</strong> to New Zealand, where it is found at just one site near Cromwell in Central Otago, on the South Island (3). This 81 hectare area became the Cromwell Chafer Beetle Nature Reserve in 1983 (3). Within this site, just four discrete populations are known (2).</p></p><h2><img src="/rimg/factsheet/Habitat.png" class="heading" /></h2><p class="Habitat"><p>This beetle is found in an area of windblown sand dunes, beneath which there is a bed of gravel. Six vegetation types have been found in the area (3). The beetle is associated with scabweeds (<i>Raoulia</i> species) and silver tussock (<i>Poa laevis</i>) (4). The vegetation cover is dynamic, as there is heavy grazing by rabbits (3).</p></p><h2><img src="/rimg/factsheet/Biology.png" class="heading" /></h2><p class="Biology"><p>The Cromwell chafer is a <strong>nocturnal</strong> species, active during the spring and summer from August to March. It emerges at night to feed on speedwell (<i>Veronica arvensis</i>), cushion plant (<i>Raoulia australis</i>), sheep's sorrel (<i>Rumex acetosella</i>) and a number of lichens (2). Activity is highest on warm nights when humidity is low, and they tend not to emerge if the temperature is below six degrees Celsius. (2). In the day, adults burrow up to half a metre deep in the soil, typically at the base of silver tussock (<i>Poa cita</i>); they tend to return to the same burrow that they used the previous day (2). Studies have shown that females do not disperse, but it is the males that wander in search of females to mate with. Males also tend to emerge earlier in the year than females (3)</p><p>Very little is known of the <strong>larval stage</strong> of this beetle. It is thought that they may be associated with the roots of silver tussock, and that they may take more than one year to develop. <strong>Pupae</strong> of this species have never been found (3).</p></p><h2><img src="/rimg/factsheet/Threats.png" class="heading" /></h2><p class="Threats"><p>The original range of the Cromwell chafer was around 500 hectares, but this was reduced to just 100 hectares following the construction of the Clyde Dam and the expansion of the township of Cromwell (4).  Threats facing this species are not fully understood, but are thought to include predation by introduced hedgehogs (<i>Erinaceus europaeus</i>). The little owl (<i>Athene noctua</i>) is also known to predate upon this species (3). Habitat alteration is also likely to be a problem (2). At the present time, large areas of apparently suitable habitat are not occupied by this beetle. It is imperative that the reasons for its present distribution and the factors limiting the population are understood (3).</p></p><h2><img src="/rimg/factsheet/Conservation.png" class="heading" /></h2><p class="Conservation"><p>The site supporting this species has been fully protected since it became a nature reserve in 1983. Research and monitoring of the Cromwell chafer populations are on-going, and current work is focusing on the predation risk posed by hedgehogs and other predators, potential competitors, and understanding the life history of the species (3). Hopes are that the knowledge gained from these studies will help to develop and guide the effective conservation of this unique and very rare beetle.</p></p><h2><img src="/rimg/factsheet/FurtherInformation.png" class="heading" /></h2><p class="Find out more"><p>For more information on the Cromwell chafer see:</p><p><ul><li>Ferreira, S.

<ul>
<li><strong>Endemic: </strong>a species or taxonomic group that is only found in one particular country or geographic area.</li>
<li><strong>Larval stage: </strong>stage in an animal’s lifecycle after it hatches from the egg. Larvae are typically very different in appearance to adults; they are able to feed and move around but usually are unable to reproduce.</li>
<li><strong>Nocturnal: </strong>active at night.</li>
<li><strong>Pupae: </strong>stage in an insect’s development when huge changes occur, which reorganise the larval form into the adult form. In butterflies the pupa is also called a chrysalis.</li>
