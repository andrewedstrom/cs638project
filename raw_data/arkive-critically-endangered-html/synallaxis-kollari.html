        <h2><img src="/rimg/factsheet/Status.png" class="heading" /></h2><p class="Status"><p>The hoary-throated spinetail is classified as Critically Endangered (CR) on the IUCN Red List (1).</p></p><h2><img src="/rimg/factsheet/Description.png" class="heading" /></h2><p class="Description"><p>The hoary-throated spinetail (<em>Synallaxis kollari</em>) is a small, long-tailed bird with a bright reddish-brown body, a reddish-brown tail, yellowish-brown to whitish underparts, and distinctive head markings. The top of the head is grey-brown, with a reddish-brown stripe over the eye, and the cheeks are grey with a white stripe. The white throat is speckled black, giving this species its common name, and the lower throat is black (2) (3) (4) (5) (6). The tips of the <strong>flight feathers</strong> are a darker dusky brown, and the beak and legs are bluish-grey. The male and female hoary-throated spinetail are similar in appearance, but no descriptions of the juvenile are available (2) (3). The song of this species consists of two short notes, repeated at one-second intervals, with the first note higher pitched than the second (2) (3) (4) (6).</p></p><h2><img src="/rimg/factsheet/Range.png" class="heading" /></h2><p class="Range"><p>The hoary-throated spinetail is known only from a few sites along rivers in northern Roraima, Brazil, and in adjacent Guyana (2) (3) (4) (5) (6). It has a highly fragmented range, with patches of suitable habitat thought to total no more than 206 square kilometres (4) (7).</p></p><h2><img src="/rimg/factsheet/Habitat.png" class="heading" /></h2><p class="Habitat"><p>The hoary-throated spinetail appears to be restricted to a narrow strip, under 500 metres wide, of seasonally flooded riverine forest. These forests are surrounded by savanna, and have an understorey of dense thickets and vines (2) (3) (4) (5) (6).</p></p><h2><img src="/rimg/factsheet/Biology.png" class="heading" /></h2><p class="Biology"><p>Little is known about the biology of the hoary-throated spinetail. Like other members of the Furnariidae family, it is likely to feed on <strong>invertebrates</strong> such as insects, taking prey in dense undergrowth, near the ground (2) (3) (6). It probably feeds alone or in pairs (2) (3) (6), and is presumed to be <strong>monogamous</strong> (2), although very little is known about its life history. The only records of the hoary-throated spinetail’s breeding behaviour are of incomplete nests, one of which was found in July and was believed to have been constructed by both the male and female. Located in dense vegetation, it was cup-shaped and built from twigs (2) (3) (4) (8). However, it is likely that, as in related species, the completed nest would be a dome of sticks with a cover, a tubular entrance, and very little lining (3) (8).</p></p><h2><img src="/rimg/factsheet/Threats.png" class="heading" /></h2><p class="Threats"><p>The main threat to the hoary-throated spinetail is the rapid conversion of its habitat to rice plantations, with the burning of vegetation potentially posing a further problem (3) (4) (7). Although still thought to be relatively common where it occurs, the species is restricted to a tiny and fragmented range, none of which is officially protected, and is believed to number only around 5,000 or so individuals (2) (3) (4) (7). With so little known about the hoary-throated spinetail, there is also the potential for unidentified threats to take a toll on the species before they are recognised (9).</p></p><h2><img src="/rimg/factsheet/Conservation.png" class="heading" /></h2><p class="Conservation"><p>Although not occurring within officially protected areas, nearly 60 percent of the hoary-throated spinetail’s habitat is inside indigenous reserves, where the indigenous people have a much better record of maintaining the ecosystem than non-indigenous peoples. Most rice production in Roraima is carried out illegally by non-indigenous people on indigenous land, but in some areas, such as São Marcos Indigenous Reserve, rice producers have been evicted, hopefully giving renewed hope for the wildlife there (3) (4) (7). Producers should also have been evicted from Raposa-Serra do Sol following its legalisation in 2005, but this is not yet known to have occurred (3) (7).</p>
<p>Due to a lack of data on the hoary-throated spinetail, the species was taken off Brazil’s list of threatened species, although it is hoped that it will be put back on in the future (3) (7). Priorities for the conservation of the hoary-throated spinetail include improving knowledge about its ecology and behaviour, and taking measures to protect its habitat, including assessing the impact of recent fires, supporting indigenous peoples seeking to prevent habitat destruction within their reserves, and increasing the number of officially protected areas within Roraima (3) (4) (9) (10).</p></p><h2><img src="/rimg/factsheet/FurtherInformation.png" class="heading" /></h2><p class="Find out more"><p>To find out more about the hoary-throated spinetail and its conservation see:</p>
