        <h2><img src="/rimg/factsheet/Status.png" class="heading" /></h2><p class="Status"><p><em>Cobitis puncticulata</em> is classified as Critically Endangered (CR) on the IUCN Red List (1).</p></p><h2><img src="/rimg/factsheet/Description.png" class="heading" /></h2><p class="Description"><p>A Critically Endangered freshwater fish of Greece and Turkey, Cobitis puncticulata is a peculiar looking fish with a brownish body and a scattering of small, dark-grey dots across the head and upperparts. In fact, this species scientific name refers to its spotty pattern, as punticulata is derived from a Latin noun meaning ‘small dot’ (2) (3).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<div>
	First described as recently as 1998, Cobitis puncticulata has a small head, with a slightly arched mouth and three pairs of long <strong>barbels</strong>. The lips are very finely furrowed, and the eyes are placed relatively far forward on the head. There is a blackish stripe from the eyes to the tip of the snout, and a dark stripe stretching along the side of the body, to the base of the tail. There are also rows of dark grey dots on the <strong>dorsal</strong> and <strong>caudal fins</strong> (2) (3). The male Cobitis puncticulata tends to be smaller than the female (4).<br />
	 </div>
</p><h2><img src="/rimg/factsheet/Range.png" class="heading" /></h2><p class="Range"><p>Initially, <em>Cobitis puncticulata</em> was known only from the Karadere stream at the outlet of Manyas Lake, Turkey (1). However, surveys recently found it at two additional locations, both in Greece: a small stream running to the lower River Evros near the village of Lira, and in the River Ulubat at the road from Bursa to Ulubat (5).</p></p><h2><img src="/rimg/factsheet/Habitat.png" class="heading" /></h2><p class="Habitat"><p><em>Cobitis puncticulata</em> lives in rather cold, well-oxygenated, slow-moving streams with muddy bottoms and much submerged vegetation (1).</p></p><h2><img src="/rimg/factsheet/Biology.png" class="heading" /></h2><p class="Biology"><p>Owing to its recent discovery and its rarity, there is very little information available on the biology and behaviour of Cobitis puncticulata, other than that it <strong>spawns</strong> in spring (2) (3).</p>
<div>
	Cyprinidae species usually have quite a diverse diet, and Cobitis puncticulata is likely to feed on a variety of insects, <strong>crustaceans</strong>, <strong>molluscs</strong> and some plant material. Members of the Cyprinidae family lack teeth in the jaws, but most have a pair of enlarged bones in the throat which possess structures known as ‘pharyngeal teeth’, used to process food (6).<br />
	 </div>
</p><h2><img src="/rimg/factsheet/Threats.png" class="heading" /></h2><p class="Threats"><p>At Manyas Lake, <em>Cobitis puncticulata</em> is threatened by water extraction, which is causing the water level to decrease. Industrial and agricultural activities are also polluting the waters (1).&nbsp;</p>
<p>In Greece, however, the situation is very different, and this species’ habitat appears to be much more secure. In addition, small, densely vegetated streams have been poorly explored in this region of Greece, meaning that additional populations of <em>Cobitis puncticulata</em> are likely to be discovered in future (5). In light of this, some scientists argue that the status of <em>Cobitis puncticulata</em> on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species should be downgraded from Critically Endangered to Vulnerable (4) (5).</p></p><h2><img src="/rimg/factsheet/Conservation.png" class="heading" /></h2><p class="Conservation"><p>To reverse the decline of <em>Cobitis puncticulata</em> at Manyas Lake, the water level should be controlled and habitat loss prevented. Across this species’ range, there is also a need for further studies into its population size and biology (4).</p></p><h2><img src="/rimg/factsheet/FurtherInformation.png" class="heading" /></h2><p class="Find out more"><p>Find out more about <em>Cobitis puncticulata</em>:</p>
