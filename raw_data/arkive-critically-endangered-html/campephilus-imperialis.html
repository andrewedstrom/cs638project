        <h2><img src="/rimg/factsheet/Status.png" class="heading" /></h2><p class="Status"><p>The imperial woodpecker is classified as Critically Endangered (CR) on the IUCN Red List (1) and is listed on Appendix I of CITES (4).</p></p><h2><img src="/rimg/factsheet/Description.png" class="heading" /></h2><p class="Description"><p>The imperial woodpecker (<em>Campephilus imperialis</em>) is the largest woodpecker in the world. Although classified as Critically Endangered (CR) on the IUCN Red List, the imperial woodpecker was thought to have gone extinct in the late 20th century (1) (3).</p>
<p>The huge imperial woodpecker is predominantly black, with large white patches on each wing, and two narrow, white stripes extending up its upper back, giving the appearance of braces (2). The large bill of the imperial woodpecker is ivory-coloured (3).</p>
<p>The male imperial woodpecker is distinguished by its red nape and a distinctive red and black crescent-shaped crest on its head. The long, black crest of the female curls forward (3). The juvenile imperial woodpecker is browner than the adults (2).</p>
<p>The vocalisations of the imperial woodpecker have been reported as cackling notes and toy trumpet-like calls (2) (3).</p></p><h2><img src="/rimg/factsheet/Range.png" class="heading" /></h2><p class="Range"><p>The imperial woodpecker was recorded throughout the Sierra Madre Occidental mountain range in Mexico (2) (5).</p></p><h2><img src="/rimg/factsheet/Habitat.png" class="heading" /></h2><p class="Habitat"><p>The imperial woodpecker prefers large areas of continuous, open pine forest at elevations above 2,000 metres. Suitable forests are usually located on plateaus and are highly rich in mature trees, as well as dead, standing trees known as ‘snags’ (3).</p></p><h2><img src="/rimg/factsheet/Biology.png" class="heading" /></h2><p class="Biology"><p>There have been limited sightings of the imperial woodpecker, and so very&nbsp;little is known about its biology. The imperial woodpecker is thought to have similar foraging behaviour to the closely related ivory-billed woodpecker (<em>Campephilus principalis</em>), and will use its large bill to hollow out the bark from dead or decaying trees to access beetle <strong>larvae</strong> (6).</p>
<p>The patchy distribution of the imperial woodpecker's primary food source means that it is probably best exploited by groups of birds&nbsp;occupying very large areas of pine forest. In the past, the imperial woodpecker could be found in groups of up to 20 individuals, although it typically occurred in groups of between 4 and 8 (2).</p>
<p>The imperial woodpecker has been recorded breeding between February and June, when up to four eggs are probably laid (2). It is thought that the juveniles remain with the adults until at least the next nesting season (6).</p></p><h2><img src="/rimg/factsheet/Threats.png" class="heading" /></h2><p class="Threats"><p>The imperial woodpecker has not been recorded since the mid-20th century. Extensive habitat loss, as well as hunting for recreation, food and medicine, has hugely reduced population numbers, leading to its possible extinction (2).</p>
<p>Large-scale logging has destroyed much of the imperial woodpeckers habitat, and by 1996, the area of suitable breeding habitat had been reduced to just 22 square kilometres (2). Much of the Sierra Madre region is now used for growing illegal crops of opium poppies and marijuana, further contributing to the loss of the imperial woodpecker’s habitat (7).</p>
<p>Recent expeditions to this area have found that much of the habitat is now unsuitable for the imperial woodpecker. It is thought that if any remaining populations do exist, then they must be extremely small (4).</p></p><h2><img src="/rimg/factsheet/Conservation.png" class="heading" /></h2><p class="Conservation"><p>Protected and managed areas of old-growth forest in the Sierra Madre do exist; however, illegal drug trafficking and levels of violence are high, making conservation of these areas difficult (7).</p>
<p>A number of searches have been carried out to find evidence of the imperial woodpecker, but these have all proved unsuccessful (2) (3). Searches of areas of suitable habitat are continuing and all reports of sightings are investigated in order to find any possible evidence that the imperial woodpecker still survives (2).</p></p><h2><img src="/rimg/factsheet/FurtherInformation.png" class="heading" /></h2><p class="Find out more"><p>Find out more about the imperial woodpecker and its conservation:</p>
