        <h2><img src="/rimg/factsheet/Status.png" class="heading" /></h2><p class="Status"><p>Listed as Critically Endangered (CR) on the IUCN Red List (1) and listed on Appendix II of CITES (3).</p></p><h2><img src="/rimg/factsheet/Description.png" class="heading" /></h2><p class="Description"><p>A Critically Endangered reptile, the day gecko is found only in tiny forest fragments in southeastern Madagascar (1). An otherwise vibrantly green gecko, three red lines sit conspicuously on the rear of the back and two distinctive red bars, that are surrounded by a scattering of blue spots, run between the brown eyes and yellow eye-rings (2). The throat, belly and underside of the tail are all a contrasting white (4). In common with other geckos, the body is flattened and soft skinned, with a large head that lacks eyelids; the day gecko instead using its long, mobile tongue to clean its eyes (5).</p></p><h2><img src="/rimg/factsheet/Range.png" class="heading" /></h2><p class="Range"><p>The day gecko is known from only the Ambatotsirongorongo Forest and Sainte Luce in the Tolagnaro region of southeastern Madagascar (1) (4). The distribution of this island <strong>endemic</strong> is highly fragmented and it was once also found in the Petriky Forest, but has not been seen there since 1994 and is now thought to be locally extinct (1).&nbsp;</p></p><h2><img src="/rimg/factsheet/Habitat.png" class="heading" /></h2><p class="Habitat"><p>The day gecko has a very close association with a single species of <em>Pandus </em>tree in which it lays its eggs, and it is only found in the coastal forests of the Tolagnaro region that support this tree species (1).&nbsp;</p></p><h2><img src="/rimg/factsheet/Biology.png" class="heading" /></h2><p class="Biology"><p>As its common name suggests, the day gecko is a <strong>diurnal</strong> species that locates its prey using a combination of visual and chemical cues. Insects, spiders and other small <strong>invertebrates</strong> are its main prey, but the day gecko will supplement its diet with fruit, pollen and nectar from flowers (5). The day gecko has also been observed forming an unlikely <strong>symbiotic relationship</strong> with plant hopper insects. The gecko repeatedly nods its head at the insect until it receives a ball of honeydew, a sugar-rich substance secreted by the insect upon which the gecko feeds. This relationship is not entirely understood; however, it is possible that the insect receives protection from predators in return for its secretions (6).&nbsp;</p>
<p>Geckos have well-developed vocal cords and, consequently, are capable of producing a large variety of chirps, clicks, growls and barks, which along with visual signals are used in communication. Most gecko species produce two hard eggs, which may be laid in shallow pits, under bark or on plant or rocky surfaces (5).</p></p><h2><img src="/rimg/factsheet/Threats.png" class="heading" /></h2><p class="Threats"><p>Occupying an area thought to be no more than nine square kilometres, the day gecko is threatened by further loss of its habitat. This extremely rare gecko has a highly fragmented distribution, making it vulnerable to any detrimental activities within what little habitat remains (1). One small population is likely to be lost within the next 25 years as mining activity is planned in part of Sainte Luce, while many other populations are under continual threat from local communities exploiting the forest’s resources (1). Indeed, the day gecko is suspected to have become extinct in Petriky Forest due to tree felling for timber, fuel and conversion to agricultural land (2). This highly specialised species is also threatened by the selective removal of <em>Pandus</em> trees (1).&nbsp;</p></p><h2><img src="/rimg/factsheet/Conservation.png" class="heading" /></h2><p class="Conservation"><p>The Ambatotsirongorongo Forest, which supports a large proportion of the remaining day gecko population, is encompassed by a newly created protected area. Five forest fragments at Sainte Luce in which the day gecko is also found are also managed within a community resource use agreement, which aims to protect the local people’s livelihoods whilst conserving biodiversity (1). However, the successful management of these areas will very much depend on the support of the local people and the abandonment of destructive activities, such as slash-and-burn agriculture and hunting (7). Fortunately for the day gecko, <em>Phelsuma </em>&nbsp;species breed well in captivity and the initiation of a captive-breeding programme for this gecko may well safeguard it from extinction (2).&nbsp;</p></p><h2><img src="/rimg/factsheet/FurtherInformation.png" class="heading" /></h2><p class="Find out more"><p>For more information on conservation in Madagascar, see:</p>
