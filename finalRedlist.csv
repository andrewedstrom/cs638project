Current areas of habitat are threatened by slash and burn agriculture, charcoal production, burning for cattle pasture and logging (Sommer 2003). There is a road that now cuts through the middle of the species' range, and has divided the range. Throughout its range, increasing visits by hunters and their dogs have targeted this species.

    The species' habitat is threatened by encroaching agriculture as the local human population expands.  In addition, the species is shot by numerous parties of hunters coming from cities up to 200 km away to shoot deer by spotlighting at night.  The extent of occurrence of Tehuantepec jackrabbits is jeopardized by habitat alteration and degradation by introduction of exotic grasses, human-induced fires, agriculture, cattle-raising activities, and human settlements in savannas.  Predation was the major cause of mortality for radio-marked jackrabbits and accounted for 94% of juvenile deaths and 67% of adult deaths during a 29 month study.  Human-induced fires in the savanna accounted for 20% of adult deaths.  Poaching accounted for 13% of adult deaths, and for 6% of juvenile deaths. There is also low genetic variation.

In the Dorrigo area, Lemckert (1999) found that it was less abundant in recently logged areas and sites where there was little undisturbed forest. The impacts of feral animals, domestic stock, weed invasion and disturbance to riparian vegetation, all potential threats to current populations, are unknown (Hines, Mahony and McDonald 1999). Populations now generally exist in small, isolated patches of forest. The effect this may have on genetic variation within populations and the general health of individuals is unknown.

    This is a high elevation species, collected at around 3,500 m, which - given lack of further collection records and nature of the habitat and topography inÂ whichÂ it was originally found - is assumed to be restricted to a narrow geographic area.Â ClimaticÂ change is the most severe threat to restricted range, high elevation species which occupy a very specific climatic niche, particularly as several species have already been seen to have migrated several hundred metres uphillÂ over the periodÂ since the description of this species (T.

    Low levels of decline have been observed in the habitats. In the 1970s dam construction in Popovo polje (Herzegovina) impacted water levels which supply the springs from near Metkovic to Dubrovnik. In recent years, the region around Metkovic is now a highly productive agricultural area, with the use of pesticides. In addition there is little sewage management, and so these waters pollute the groundwater. A further threat for the future of the systems is 3 dams being constructed upstream of Metkovic, which will have a major impact by taking water from the system, as well as increasing the rate of inflow from the sea, causing increased salinity, and hence mortality of the species. The conditions of the Ombla spring will be altered due to the construction of a dam that is in plan. The area around Dubrovnik and Cavtat is under stress during the tourist season, being affected by water extraction and pollution.

    The habitat of this species has been reduced by timber harvest; the conversion of mesic ravines to pine monocultures and the clearing of ridge tops above ravines destroys or degrades available habitat. Overcollecting may have caused a decline in some areas (Bury, Dodd and Fellers 1980; Jordan and Mount 1975). Nearly all habitats are on private timber company lands, and detrimental forestry practices continue (Dodd 1989, 1991), though some problems have been alleviated by management agreements (K. Dodd pers. comm. 1995). Feral pigs are a threat in some areas.

    This species is highly restricted in distribution, occurs in generally small subpopulations, and shows little evidence of recovering from historical habitat losses without significant positive human intervention. Principle causes of decline include impoundments, channelization, pollution, and sedimentation that have altered or eliminated those habitats that are essential to the long-term viability of many riverine mussel populations. Detailed information on these threats can be found in USFWS (2003).  Many of the impacts discussed in USFWS (2003) occurred in the past as unintended consequences of human development in the Apalachicolan Region. However, the species and its habitats continue to be impacted by excessive sediment bed loads of smaller sediment particles, changes in turbidity, increased suspended solids (primarily resulting from nonpoint-source loading from poor land-use practices, lack of BMPs, and maintenance of existing BMPs), and pesticides. Other primarily localized impacts include gravel mining, reduced water quality below dams, developmental activities, water withdrawal, impoundments, and alien species. Toxic spills are also a possibility in all extant populations (USFWS 2003).  Siltation from poorly conducted agricultural and silvicultural activities; chicken farm litter nutrients; localized industrial, municipal, and residential pollution; watershed development (bridge, highway construction projects, etc.), urban sprawl in upper Flint and Chattahoochee may impact potential populations; competition from Asian Clam is a possibility.

    The main threat to this species is habitat loss due to logging, agricultural expansion and sea level rise. The interior forests remain fairly intact since the terrain is too steep or rugged to make agriculture or logging viable; however, the lowland forests have been extensively cleared for agriculture, and logging is also taking place (Rosillo-Calle and Woods 2003). Â Furthermore increases in soil erosion due to logging may threaten this species habitat. Sea level rise may result in habitat degradation and loss due to inundation of low-lying areas, forest structural damage due to increasingly frequent and intense storm surges, and plant toxicity from groundwater salinization. The pet trade could become a problem, and smuggling of lizards out of the country has been reported by the Environment Unit.

    Lake Biwa is under threat from eutrophication as a result of the surrounding towns, cities and farmland increasing the nutrient loads through sewage and run-off entering the lake (Lake Biwa Museum 2009). The urbanisation of the shoreline and conversion of inflowing streams and rivers to concrete irrigation ditches has contributed to the additional sedimentation and pollution the lake recieves (Lake Biwa Museum 2009). Habitat loss, such as the conversion of adjacent lakes to paddy fields and reed bed reduction by over 50%, has compounded the ability of the lake to remove excess nutrients and added a new source of turbid water (Ramsar 2008, Lake Biwa Museum 2009). There are additional environmental imapcts resulting from recreational activites, such as rubbish and discarded fishhooks (Ramsar 2008). The Biwa-ko Total Development Project which is designed to control and utilise the lake's water has modified the landscape of the lake and changed the water levels (Ramsar 2008). Dredging the lake for bivalves is also a negative impact to this species (F. KÃ¶hler pers. comm. 2010), as individuals are discarded as by-catch.

It is also sometimes caught in snares set for other animals (Bleisch 1995). Previously, collection of magnolia flower buds and bark (by cutting down tress) by local villagers removed a food source of this species, but this practice has reportedly ceased (Dunyan pers. comm. 2006). There is currently construction and development for tourism, including a tourist road, cable car and hotels within the nature reserve, which are a potential threat because of habitat destruction and disturbance. At lower elevations, there is continued pressure from agricultural expansion and collection of firewood. The species occurs at only a single locality, making it vulnerable to epidemic disease or catastrophes.

Although this invasive species has been known from the island for 150 years, an irruption was first detected in the west of Savai'i in 2012 (R. Fisher pers. comm. 2013). Due to a shortage of surveys it is not clear when this irruption began. On this island, the lizard appears to have disappeared from areas below 500 m in areas where ants have irrupted, and can no longer be found in apparently optimal habitat (R. Fisher pers. comm. 2012). No information is available on the status or distribution of invasive ants in eastern Savai'i, or any effects on lizard subpopulations (R. Fisher pers. comm. 2013).

    Njala, the type locality in Sierra Leone has expanded since the species was last seen there in 1940, becoming the National University, and forest habitat has been lost as a result. The situation at Robat is not known although since 1935, forest habitat in West Africa as a whole has shrunk by >30%Â (M. Cheek pers. obs. 2012). In Guinea, one of the granitic inselbergs on which this species grows is set to become part of a new port for exporting iron ore (M. Cheek pers obs. 2012). However, the company involved are seeking to translocate the species to future offset sites based on advice from Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew.

    Threatened by illegal hunting, destruction of montane forest and heathlands, encroachment by cattle, expansion of high-altitude cultivation, roads, and harassment by dogs. Permanent occupation of suitable habitat as a result of increasing human and livestock populations is exerting tremendous pressure on nyala habitat throughout the range, with anecdotal evidence suggesting mountain nyalas actively avoid livestock (Sillero-Zubiri in press). Mountain Nyalas are extensively hunted for meat and horns, the latter used for local medicine and to make nipples for traditional milk bottles. Trophy hunting blocks in Arsi have been hunted out and concessions moved to Bale, with continued pressure by the industry for additional hunting blocks and larger quotas. Effects of current trophy-hunting programs are not well understood and current trophy hunting quotas may be unsustainable in the long-term (Sillero-Zubiri in press). Its restricted range, and fragmented populations, make it highly vulnerable to human activities and stochastic events.

The small Kuni-Muktar Wildlife Sanctuary was established in 1990 as a second protected area for mountain nyala, but by 1996 this sanctuary had suffered severely from poaching, deforestation, cultivation and gully erosion, and the species no longer occurred.', <br/>, <br/>, 'The mountain nyala, along with the Ethiopian wolf, is a key flagship species for Bale Mountains National Park and its future will be closely tied to the future of this protected area. It is also very important to spread the risk by establishing effective protection and management of mountain nyala populations elsewhere within its range. Sustainable trophy hunting in some of these areas has very high potential for generating the revenue needed to fund effective conservation of this species and the other endemics which share its habitat. It may also be advisable to establish a self-sustaining captive population in collaboration with the Ethiopian conservation authorities, as an insurance against future adversity for the wild population.\n\n    \n  ']",Decreasing,"

    The lower montane forest of Sabah have been subject to a high degree of forest loss and as an epiphyte this species is affected by removal of host trees. Forest have been clearedÂ  as a result of logging activities, timber plantations and the expansion of agriculture, particularly of plantations such as oil palm. Increased use of temperate crops has extended the altitudinal range for cultivation, shifting cultivation still has impacts as has increased tourism and associated developments (Environmental and Conservation Workgroup 2001). As forests are opened up the risk of fire also increases. In 1998, the total area burnt in Sabah was estimated as being between 130,000 - 150,000 ha (Sabah Forestry Department 2013). Satellite imagery shows evidence of forest clearance in the areas where the specimens are believed to have been collected. It is not thought that this species is subject to collection from the wild as it has small flowers and is less attractive than larger flowered species, however, climate change with more regular El NiÃ±o droughts may be a future threat (A.

VÃ¡squez-AlmazÃ¡n pers. comm. 2014).Â Although it also occurs in a protected area in Honduras, the site where this species was collected within the national park has recently suffered extensive illegal logging and habitat destruction (J. Kolby pers. comm. 2011). The chytrid fungus has also been detected at this locality, but its impact on terrestrial salamanders is unknown  (J. Kolby pers. comm. 2011).

    The species is threatened by habitat loss through logging operations and land clearance; it is also adversely affected by the conversion of land for agriculture, especially for oil palm plantations. It is particularly threatened by the removal of large roost trees (Parnaby 2002). The species is believed to have become extinct on Kolombangara because of extensive logging operations between 1966 and 1980 (Flannery 1995; Parnaby 2002). There is some local hunting of this species, and while it is currently not intensively hunted, the hunting pressure on this species is predicted to rise with the increasing human population of the Solomon Islands (Flannery 1995; Parnaby 2002).

    Habitat conversion poses the most serious threat to the Houston toad. Several populations were eliminated with the expansion of Houston, and the largest remaining population in Bastrop County is also under intense and immediate threat from urbanization and recreational over-development. Many Houston toads are killed each year by automobiles. Roadway mortality will increase as human populations continue to increase within the speciesâ?? habitat and as the habitat continues to be dissected by more roads. Road construction further isolates populations and disrupts or prevents the movement of individual toads between populations. This movement of toads is necessary to maintain gene flow, and thus genetic diversity, and to supplement small or declining local populations. It is possible to build roads with underpasses or other structures that allow toads and other wildlife to pass safely beneath the roads. While converting woodlands to pastures or ploughed fields destroys Houston toad habitat and favours the proliferation of other toad species, certain agricultural practices can be beneficial to Houston toads. These include maintaining low to moderate numbers of livestock to avoid overgrazing, protecting pond habitat from livestock and predatory fish, planting native bunchgrasses instead of sod-forming grasses such as Bermuda grass (which are difficult for the toads to move through), and conserving large blocks of woodlands. Certain forestry practices may benefit the Houston toad, while others, such as clear cutting, are harmful. Thinning and burning have been shown to benefit some species of amphibians and reptiles by opening up the forest canopy and allowing more sunlight to reach the forest floor. This practice encourages the growth of vegetation and, in turn, increases insect numbers. This may be beneficial to the Houston toad. Other threats that often appear in conjunction with the factors outlined above include prolonged drought and the presence of fire ants, an unwelcome species from Brazil. Fire ants have been observed preying on toadlets as they leave their breeding pond. Fire ants thrive in open, sunny areas where the soil has been disturbed and woody vegetation uprooted, as in agricultural fields and urban areas. Protecting large forested areas is one of the most effective deterrents to fire ants. Where fire ant control with pesticides is necessary, mounds should be treated individually, rather than broadcasting the chemicals, to avoid impacting other invertebrates that the Houston toad eats (see http://ifw2es.fws.gov/HoustonToad).

    
  ","['\n    The Houston toad was the first amphibian granted protection under the U.S. Endangered Species Act. A critical habitat was designated in 1978 in Bastrop and Burleson counties, in areas supporting the largest populations known at that time. However, the population within critical habitat in Burleson County has not been seen since 1983. In the 1970s, the state of Texas acquired land within designated critical habitat in Bastrop County adjacent to Buescher and Bastrop state parks to aid in conservation. Additionally, an effort was started in 1978 by the Houston Zoo to identify remaining Houston toad populations and supplement them or establish new populations in protected areas using wild-caught adults, naturally deposited eggs, or captive-reared juveniles and adults. However, new populations were not established in spite of introducing over 500,000 individuals (adults, juveniles, larvae) into sites at the Attwater Prairie Chicken National Wildlife Refuge. Research is urgently needed to determine the status of Houston toad populations outside Bastrop County and promote conservation efforts in these areas. Research is also critical to determine which management practices are most conducive to the Houston toad and the ecosystem on which it depends. The Houston Toad Recovery Plan was published by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) in 1984. The Texas Parks and Wildlife Department and the USFWS have jointly prepared a brochure for private landowners who wish to implement their agricultural practices in ways that are compatible with the needs of the Houston toad and the Texas Forest Service has formed a committee to develop management practices that protect the Houston toad and its habitat. Additionally, the USFWS is working with community leaders, private landowners, and conservation organizations to develop and implement a regional Habitat Conservation Plan for Bastrop County, which would provide for the issuance of endangered species permits that allow development to proceed while ensuring permanent habitat protection. The USFWS also has established a fund with the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation to assist in local habitat protection efforts for the Houston toad.\n\n    \n  ']",Decreasing,"

    Leading hypotheses for the declines are disease (chytridiomycosis), airborne contaminants, and livestock grazing. An examination of preserved specimens from a 1970 die-off found multiple pathogens, but no single pathogen was present in more than 25% of the specimens, suggesting that the animals suffered from suppressed immune systems (Green and Kagarise Sherman 2001). Davidson, Shaffer and Jennings (2002) found a weak pattern between declines at sites and amount of agricultural land upwind (suggesting that windborne agrochemicals may have contributed to declines). Livestock grazing may have detrimental impacts on Yosemite Toads through trampling, alteration of meadow habitat, and possible lowered water quality (D. Martin pers. comm.). Other factors that may have contributed to declines are the 1980s California drought, and predation by introduced trout. Ultraviolet radiation is not suspected to be a major contributor to declines based on fieldwork by Sadinski (pers. comm.).

    
  ","['\n    Most of the habitat of this species is confined within protected areas including: Yosemite National Park, Kings Canyon National Park, wilderness areas of Eldorado, Inyo, Stanislaus, and Sierra National Forest, with the highest number of populations recorded in Sierra National Forest followed by Stanislaus National Forest. Off-highway vehicle use, pack stock and cattle grazing still occur in National Forests, as well as protected wilderness areas; only pack stock use continues in Yosemite National Park and Kings Canyon National Park. Because declines have occurred in pristine areas in parks, no occurrences can be regarded as adequately protected. This species has been federally petitioned for listing under the Endangered Species Act in March 2000 by the Pacific Rivers Council and Centre for Biological Diversity. In December 2002 the US Fish and Wildlife Service published a decision in the Federal Register that placed the toad on the ""warranted-but-precluded"" list due to higher priority listings.

    The species in found in the Madagascar dry deciduous forests, which is a habitat type that has been severely destroyed, it is in fact estimated that the western dry forest has reduced by approximately 40% since the 1970s (Moat and Smith 2007) and that since human settlement of this region, an estimated 97 per cent of the islandâ??s dry deciduous western forests have been destroyed, and those remaining are extremely localized and isolated (Crowley 2001). The major threat to the dry, deciduous forests is destruction and fragmentation through intentional burning to clear land for grazing and agricultural lands, and through wildfires sparked by burning adjacent secondary grasslands. With an expanding rural population and increasing degradation of existing arable lands, the pressure on the remaining forest is extremely high. Selective logging and the removal of large trees pose additional threats of forest habitat degradation. As the distance between the subpopulations is very large (ca. 800 km) it is unlikely that genetic material is being exchanged. This could lead to a possible erosion of genetic variability by bottlenecks, genetic drift or inbreeding, meaning that as a result of the loss of genetic diversity, the populations might became more susceptible to ecological or anthropogenic perturbation.

A large length of the Chindwin (where the species was discovered) and its adjacent plains are scheduled to be inundated by the Tazone hydro-electric power dam. As well as direct loss of habitat through inundation this will result in massive increases in hunting as the construction labourers will be expected to live off the land, and the reservoir formed will greatly increase accessibility to a huge area of foothill forest; without specific, directed, management, hunters will no doubt take advantage of this. A very large area of suitable habitat falls within the proposed Hukaung Tiger Reserve, but it is unclear whether this area supports morphologically typical animals.

    Habitat loss and degradation appears to be the major threat. Its habitat occurs on land under a variety of tenures, including national parks, state forests, local government reserves, grazing leasehold properties, crown land, freehold lands and road reserves. Ninety-seven percent of frog sites are located on unprotected land, most of which is in state forest or timber reserve. There are several activities likely to occur on these lands, which may impact on the amount and quality of the frogâ??s habitat, including grazing, logging, road works, clearing and development. Habitat in the south-east of Timber Reserve 245 and Tumoulin State Forest has been severely affected by cattle grazing. Grazing and trampling has the potential to degrade and destroy the seepage areas used by the frogs for breeding. Similarly, erosion and subsequent siltation may cover seepage areas if future logging or clearing occurs. Roads and cuttings can alter the water quality and hydrology and may affect seepage areas and first order streams. Regrowth forest uses more water than old growth and therefore has the potential to reduce seepages. The population at the Ravenshoe rubbish dump has declined. Dump activities have destroyed or modified habitat, and previously known populations are now absent.

One locality, Mt Santo Tomas, has a road to the summit where numerous radar and telephone masts are located. This peak is also a popular hiking destination and the slopes have largely been cleared for small scale agriculture. From this it is inferred that the species, though possibly occurring in other localities not yet known, has undergone or is in decline as the forest it occurs in is in retreat. Its use as a special utility wood also means it will be cut selectively, further increasing pressure on the population of mature trees.

The principal threat in the Cordillera de los Huacamayos is deforestation due to colonization (Manzanares and Pitman 2003). General threats to the Eastern Cordillera Real Montane Forests ecoregion, where this species is found, include conversion of native forest to coffee plantations and other agriculture and pasture for goats and cattle. Mining operations, especially strip mining, degrade the habitat, and logging has encroached from the southern lowland forests up into the premontane areas. Urban sprawl and road construction are additional threats to the vegetation.

    Shifting cultivation, and associated burning, has affected some forest areas. There is also settled agriculture including an ongoing project to increase cocoa production in Buru, Central Maluku, and West Seram - as of 2009, Maluku had 11,835 ha of cocoa plantation (AgroAsia 2011). Commercial logging on Buru intensified during the 1970s (Wikramanayake 2002) and the Trans-Seram Highway also threatens forest habitat. There has been illegal logging, land clearance, and soil erosion. Nearly 1/5 of the Seram rainforest ecoregions native forests has been cleared, with logging continuing to pose a serious threat (Morrison 2001). This is a species of steep slopes, in pockets of humus, and moderate forest shade, making it prone to disturbance from forest clearance and soil erosion. It also has the potential threat of illegal collection, as this is an attractive orchid species.

    
  ","['\n    This orchid is listed in the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species Appendix I as it is considered that trade may threaten this species with extinction (CITES 2009). The conservation status of the Seram and Buru rainforest ecoregion is considered relatively stable (Morrison 2001 a,b). Protected areas only cover 16-17% of the land area but extensive forest cover remains. The records for this species do not fall within any protected area. The remoteness of these islands to some extent assists in reducing human induced disturbance. This species is cultivated, propagated from specimens originally brought back to Europe in the 1800s (Peterson 1985), and it has also been hybridized. It is in ', <em>ex situ</em>, ' collections such as the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew. It was not found in available lists of seed bank species.\n\n    \n  ']",Unknown,"

The establishment of several large projects (such as the Transamazonian highway BR-230), which bisects the interfluvium from east to west, the CarajÃ¡s Mineral Complex and the TucuruÃ­ hydroelectric dam, have lead to considerable habitat loss. In the north of the range, the habitat is under pressure from both small-holder and large-scale farming activities and cattle ranching. This species is also hunted for its meat and fur, and hunting pressure is likely to increase due to habitat fragmentation.

The second subpopulation is well within the Park, but close to a walking trail.  Current numbers of people walking that particular trail are very small and are unlikely to pose a threat.  Loose cattle trampling through the Park may pose a threat to individuals.  The Monte Pirata subpopulation is located within a Navy conservation zone where it is a known species of concern.

    Wood cutting is the main threat.  The wood of Cupressaceous conifers, as well as its foliage, is sought after in eastern Asian culture.  The lower slopes are being heavily deforested for the expansion of agriculture, but this is unlikely to reach the ridges.  But firewood cutting and cutting for other purposes (this species produces a fine, yellow-brown very hard, fragrant timber) evidently does occur in some areas.  Due to the lack of transport facilities and other factors, most of the timber has been traded locally.  Estimates of population decline cannot be made at this stage given our current knowledge.

    Colonization, road construction and other development projects, and logging are the main threats to the Colombian Pacific forests. Approximately 1/3 of the area has been cleared or degraded since the 1960s. The forests of ChocÃ³, although they represent only 1/6 of Colombian forests, supply more than half of the country's wood (WWF 2001). Industrial production of African palm oil, uncontrolled gold mining and illegal growing of coca add to the list of causes of deforestation, which in turn causes serious erosion, affecting the different ecosystems of the region, including the coastal areas.

    Threats to the native, endemic flora of the high altitude plateaus of Maharashtra include grazing, soil erosion, agricultural development, mining for iron and aluminium ores, tourism, dams and private land development. These pressures are likely to continue as long as the plateaus, that appear as barren and bald during most of the seasons (except monsoon), are perceived as wastelands by planners and developers (Jagdale and Kanwar 2004). The ability of this species to persist and regenerate in disturbed and secondary vegetation is unknown. The tubers yield a white edible starch, which has sometimes been used as a substitute for arrowroot starch. Hence, it is widely cultivated in some parts of Goa, Diu, Daman, Dadra and Nagar Haveli. Products containing this species are sold internationally and it is used in Indian folk medicine (Nadkarni and Nadkarmi 1994). The impact on the population, as a result of the harvest of wild tubers for the manufacture of arrowroot, is unknown. It is a very attractive species which has ornamental potential (Peter 2007). Gingers have enjoyed popularity as an ornamental plant in Asia and the Far East for centuries. Ornamental gingers have rapidly increased in popularity in the past few years in the western world (West Demmy and Burch 1998, Peter 2007), which has promoted an increase in illegal collecting.

    The primary threat is habitat loss, as described for the locality in Canton Limon-Indanza where this species was once found in forest remnants between pastures and where the area is used for subsistence farming. During the 2015 field work, it was found that deforestation is continuing in the region of the type locality, with a new paved highway nearly completed as far south as Zumba. In the previous assessment (Skinner 2014) it was suspected that the species might be present in the protected area of the Podocarpus National Park and in a sparsely settled area of mountainous terrain between Valladolid and Zamora, but this now seems less likely as we (D. Skinner, M. JimÃ©nez Villalta and M. JimÃ©nez LeÃ³n)Â did not find it in the northern part of the park or in the Alto Numbami area which has good forest at similar elevations. The only protected area where weÂ (D. Skinner, M. JimÃ©nez Villalta and M. JimÃ©nez LeÃ³n)Â saw plants presumed to be this species is the Reserva Maycu which is across the Rio Nangaritza in the Cordillera del CÃ³ndor. As noted earlier, the plants found here are of a different form from the ones at the type locality.

    The forests of Bioko and west Cameroon over 1,000 m alt. are currently under only minimal anthropogenic pressure. However, the low number of locations, and their apparent isolation, render this species vulnerable to stochastic events such as localised landslide or overgrazing by native mammals. Onana and Cheek (2011) stated that it was possible that following the exhaustion of lowland forest resources, there would be increased human encroachment into the montane forests in future unless protected by law. This has in fact happened recently at the lower elevation site in the Bakossi Mts where part of the forest in this area has been cleared to make way for the construction of a reservoir. Such development is likely to lead to further clearance of the forest for agriculture, etc.

    Water quality degradation due to industrial, mining, agricultural, and urban pollution are probably the primary reasons for the extirpation of this species over much of its historic range in the upper Black Warrior River system. The remaining Black Warrior waterdog populations are isolated from each other by unsuitable habitat created by impoundments, pollution, or other factors. The fragmentation of habitat renders populations vulnerable to catastrophic events such as flood, drought, or chemical spills.

    Assuming that soil moisture and temperature maintained by vegetation is important for the species, and bearing in mind the species' preference for forest over cultivated habitat, possible threats are habitat disturbance and conversion. In the Shimba Hills, forest disturbance is an ongoing occurrence due to elephant activity; however, the subpopulation occurring in the forest patches of the Shimba Hills National Reserve is relatively secure (P.K. Malonza pers. comm. August 2012). In Kaya Jibana Forest, human disturbance of the forest (cutting of poles and collection of fire wood) threatens the habitat. In Changamwe and the surrounding areas, additional threats are farming and human encroachment; specifically, the intensification of agriculture, application of pesticides and herbicides, the slash-and-burn method, and expanding human settlements (P.K.

    It has been calculated that the remaining forest cover totals 12% of Sichuan Province. Until a 1998 logging ban, one of the most serious threats to the area was intensive commercial logging. Forest cover in Sichuan Province, one of China's main sources of timber, declined from 19% in the 1950s to 12.6% in 1988. Furthermore this species is threatened by urbanisation and development for tourism, as well as clearing for fruit tree gardens.

Spring habitats are rapidly being altered through use of chemicals to eliminate native plants and animals so that the springs can be used for ""home water gardens,"" fishing ponds (with introduced fishes), and drinking water sources (Boschung and Mayden 2004). Stream habitats have been degraded by groundwater depletion (loss of spring influence) and massive siltation and pollution associated with urbanization (e.g., Birmingham, Alabama) (Boschung and Mayden 2004). Large concrete structures pose a barrier to dispersal (B. R. Kuhajda pers. comm. 1998), as do impoundments.

    The major threats to the species are pollution of waterbodies, habitat fragmentation, predation by introduced trout, and prolonged drought (often caused by excessive water abstraction). During the 1950s, many populations were lost through the application of DDT to waterbodies. Recently, the Gola di Gorroppu population has become threatened through damage to its habitat caused by tourist activities. At least one population is known to be affected by chytridiomycosis and is declining.

    Water quality in Lake Er Hai is said to be declining as a result of increasing pressure from nutrient discharges from non-point pollution sources (e.g., urban and agricultural run-off, livestock husbandry, and in-lake fish culture), and soil erosion due to deforestation (Dali EPB 1995). Surveys between 2000 and 2007 in Lake Er Hai showed there to be few, if any, gastropods remaining in the lake. The gastropod fishery has closed within the last ten years, the likely cause of this is use of chemicals to control algal nuisance. The introduction of the molluscivore Black Carp has also contributed to the decline in diversity and abundance of molluscs in this lake (D. Aldridge pers.comm 2010).

In the reservoir, only alien species seem to exist and above the reservoir, no fish were found in a recent survey.Â The water level in the last known site,Â Lake Meyil, is dropping fast due to climate change induced less rainfall and the lowering of the water table by pumping water for agriculture.

    The desiccation and pollution of the canal system and lakes in Xochimilco and Chalco, as a result of urbanization, as well as the traditional consumption of the species by local people, is threatening the survival of this species. Increased tourist activity is poorly regulated and adds further pollution (Zambrano, 2006). The species is also captured for medicinal purposes. The harvesting is targeted at animals that are less than one year old. It was formerly also captured for the international pet trade, although probably all animals in the international trade are now of captive origin. Introduced fishes (tilapia and carp) have increased to high abundances (a recent study collected 600kg of tilapia in one small channel using a 100m net) and have also impacted axolotls through competition and predation. The animals are also being affected by disease, probably spread by invasive species, and as a result of poor water quality. Although the water regime has changed in the last 10 years, and it is reported that pollution levels are decreasing, factors such as very high levels of bacterial contamination could still pose a serious threat.

    It is restricted to a fragment of forest surrounded by degraded land, and the remaining forest is under threat from subsistence agriculture, timber extraction, fires, and expanding human settlements. Recent surveys indicate that the habitat is being degraded in all the areas where the species occurs, and in 2001 a significant amount of the remaining suitable habitat at Torotorofotsy was affected by fire (although three years later the species was still common in the affected areas). However, the remaining habitat for the species is now severely fragmented.

The species was found in the area again during an expedition in 2008  (Cieza-Padilla and Briones-Rojas 2008). The two potential major threats for the species are the expansion of agricultural fields in the surrounding areas which is continuing (Cieza-Padilla and Briones-Rojas 2008) and illegal collection. Given its rarity, it is very likely that the species is sought after by  collectors even though remoteness of the site confers some protection.  If the locality is found by unscrupulous collectors it could be  devastating for the species.

This stretch is along the road leading to the border, which is now crowded by shops and other businesses, and domestic waste enters into the stream. Adjacent streams could not yet be surveyed. Below this point, the stream joins with the Nam Phao which is totally filled with sediments resulting from the construction of a small hydropower reservoir. The recent maintenance of the road going to Vietnam, along the river, also resulted in huge quantities of material being pushed into the river. The river is filled with sediment almost until its confluence with the Nam Theun. In addition the lower Nam Phao receives wastes from Laksao and pollution from a gold mine on one of its tributaries. As the species grazes algae on the rocks, once the rocks are covered by sediment the food disappears.

    Slash-and-burn activities resulting in forest loss represents the greatest threat to this species. Additional threats include fires set to increase livestock pasture, the cutting of trees to produce charcoal, forest destruction caused by itinerant miners, and hunting. During the dry season, they drink water on the ground, and when they move between forest patches they move along the ground where their conspicuous colouration makes them vulnerable to predators and hunters.

The total population could be as few as 500, and the effective breeding population only 125 individuals. The only protected area in which it is known to occur is the Analamerana Special Reserve. A small number may still be found as well in the eastern section of Ankarana National Park, which is connected through a series of forest patches to populations at Andriafiamena and Analamerana. It has recently been seen in unprotected forest patches between Analamerana and Ankarana, and is present in the Andavakoera Classified Forest, but probably in very low numbers. There is an urgent need for a full-time, long-term scientific presence in the Analamerana Special Reserve, as well as an expansion of this protected area to include the forests of Andriafiamena and a connection to Ankarana. This effort should also include an education campaign in the region, as well as surveys in nearby forest patches to look for any other populations. This species is not being kept in captivity.Â Research into sifaka captivity is needed to establish<span class=""apple-converted-space"">Â ex situ<span class=""apple-converted-space"">Â conservation for this species.Â It is important to note that population densities of sifakas on sandstone soil are more than twice the population density found on limestone soils.

    The threats to this species are derived from the various non-point pollution sources that arise from agricultural land, as well as increased sedimentation from any tree removals, as large sections of catchment areas for rivers where this species occurs are forested, with human population densities are currently low (Gangloff and Hartfield 2009). The Choctawhatchee River contains large ares of riparian swamps, which may further limit human encroachment on mussel habitats, reducing threats from urban run-off (Gangloff and Hartfield 2009). Speculation over the apparent decline in the mussel population may be due to a few historical milldams, as its seems that sand and silt sediments that have accumulated in former tributary impoundments may now be moving downstream to the mainstem rivers, a situation that is further exacerbated by recent droughts (Gangloff and Hartfield 2009).

    The cause of population decline is mainly attributable to the excessive demand for rhino horn and other products for Chinese and allied medicine systems (Foose and van Strien 1997). The bulk of the remaining population occurs as a single population within a national park and the population size in Ujung Kulon National Park is probably limited to the effective carrying capacity of the area (around 50 animals). One possible threat to this population is disease. In addition, such a small population faces a constant threat from poachers, although there is evidence that current poaching levels are under control (Sectionov and Waladi pers. comm.). The Cat Loc population may be too small to be viable, and no breeding has been observed for many years, and it is possible that the animals are too old to breed. The population is so small that all the animals could be of the same sex.

There is also a need to survey parts of its historical range for the very remote possibility that small remnant populations exist, especially in parts of Lao PDR or Cambodia.

    Immediate threats to this species include wildfire, inappropriate hazard reduction burns and associated fire management activities. The majority of the current known populations is reproductively immature and fire has the potential to destroy reproductively immature plants and thus lead to localized extinctions (NSW National Parks and Wildlife Service 2000). Fire intervals of less than 10â??15 years are likely to result in subpopulation declines, and fire intervals of less than three to four years are likely to result in its extinction (Department of the Environment, Water, Heritage and the Arts 2008). In the New South Wales east coast, 1.46 million hectares of both forest and non-forest landscapes were burnt in 2002-2003 (Montreal Process Implementation Group for Australia 2008); in the Goulburn River National Park the biggest wildfire in 1997-1998 burnt ~24,000 hectares, further prescribed burns were carried out every year since 2000 but the majority of the park has not been burnt since records began (NSW National Parks and Wildlife Service 2004); in Wollemi National Park the largest wildfire in 2001-2002 burnt over ~200,000 hectares and over half of the park was burnt in the last 10 years, large areas of the park are in a moderate level of risk category due to frequent fires leading to populations of threatened species possibly being under threat of depletion if current regimes are continued (NSW National Parks and Wildlife Service 2006).

Much of the original habitat was cleared for agriculture, in the areas that remain, grazing has removed the native understorey (Department of the Environment, Water, Heritage and the Arts 2006). Recommendations to reduce threat by fire include: trail maintenance, bush fire suppression, mop up operations and mechanical fuel reduction should be avoided in known species locations (NSW National Parks and Wildlife Service 2006).

Other threats include: in-stream rock extractions; off-road vehicle usage; road, culvert, bridge, gas and water easement construction and maintenance. These activities lead to water quality degradation, stream channel instability, fragmentation of habitat and hydrology, and overall changes in the geomorphology of the Turkey Creek watershed. In addition, natural waterfalls are dispersal barriers to the connectivity of the Vermilion Darter populations.

North of Baniyas town lies Baniyas port with one of the largest oil refineries in Syria and a hydro-electric power plant. The remaining 'open space' between Baniyas and Jableh, i.e; some 10 km, is mainly used for agro-industrial purposes (greenhouse farming, citrus and olive plantations). The surface waters are polluted by untreated urban and industrial sewage, by agricultural run-off (high amounts of fertilizers and pesticides) and by heavy organic loads of hundreds of olive oil mills scattered along the coast (ICMZ-NPR 2009).

Therefore, processes which may ultimately threaten the survival of the species as a whole include climate change-induced temperature shifts, processes which alter the dispersal of the food plant or those which cause the Rock Hyrax to encroach on previously uninhabited caves, as Cave Katydids and Rock Hyrax do not appear to inhabit the same caves.

    It is unknown what threats impacted on this species in the past. It has been postulated that an extended drought in the early 1930s which is known to have drastically lowered the water levels in the already shallow Utah Lake, combined with harsh winters that caused the lake to freeze to the bottom, would probably have killed all but the hardiest of organisms living there. The early 1930s is also the time at which endemic fish and snail species became extinct in Lake Utah (K. Perez pers. comm. 2011). Low water levels would also have greatly increased the alkalinity of the lake which may have also contributed to the decline of this species (Oliver and Bosworth III 1999). The single site remains in poor condition (J. Cordeiro pers. comm. 2012). However, further targeted surveys, appropriate to this species, need to be carried out in order to provide more evidence that this species may be extinct.

    This species has been intensively fished since the 1950s, primarily being taken on longlines, and the dramatic decline in the total population of Southern Bluefin Tuna to 7â??15% of the 1960 parental biomass is well documented (FSC 2009). Canning was the most important form of local utilization of this highly esteemed fish until the early 1980s. This species is considered depleted by Majkowski (2007), and seriously overfished by Joseph (2009). If the current exploitation continues, it is estimated that the population will be below 500 mature individuals in 100 years. According the most recent stock assessment, there is no current sign that the spawning stock of this species is rebuilding (CCSBT 2009, CCSBT 2010).

There are several management measures in place including catch control, vessel monitoring, etc. However, more restrictions may be needed.', <br/>, <br/>, 'The CCSBT agreed that the status of the stock is at a critical stage and that a meaningful reduction in the total allowable catch (TAC) is necessary in order to recover the stock and work toward reaching an interim rebuilding target reference point of 20% of the original spawning stock. Consequently, the CCSBT reduced the global total allowable catch (TAC) for 2010 and 2011 to an average level over the two years of 80% of the previously allocated global TAC of 11,810 tonnes. Accordingly, the average global TAC for each of the 2010 and 2011 fishing seasons will be 9,449 tonnes.

    Hunting for the purposes of traditional ""medicine"" is the primary threat facing this species; most of the populations that survive are heavily reduced and fragmented. Only the subpopulation at Van Long, with about 50 individuals, is thought likely to survive given the current hunting pressure; however, quarrying for limestone (cement), which is currently taking place there, has affected the ranging behaviour of the animals (T. Nadler pers. comm.). The smallest groups are extremely unlikely to survive should the one reproductively active male be taken or killed (Nadler 2004). Forest loss is a more minor threat as it occurs in degraded areas. A potential threat is the rapid development of tourist facilities adjacent to protected areas, especially around Van Long and Hoa Lu Nature Reserves.

    
  ","[""\n    This species is currently listed only as CITES Appendix II. It is considered 'endangered' in Viet Nam, and is listed as a 'most endangered' species under Annex 1B of Decree 32 (2006). It occurs in six protected areas, but many still experience high hunting pressure. Van Long Nature Reserve was established for this species in 2001, and there has been some evidence of population growth in this reserve in the past five years. The connection of forest fragments in some already protected areas, such as Van Long, could greatly increase the size and survivability of some subpopulations. Also considered as beneficial population management for this species are the translocation of severely threatened (small) groups to safe and suitable habitat, and the augmentation of existing groups with offspring from a captive population. Delacour's langurs have been successfully kept and bred in captivity at the Endangered Primate Rescue Center in Cuc Phuong National Park, Viet Nam, which is currently the only collection keeping this species (Nadler 2004). It is necessary to ensure the sustainability of these programs. The Provincial People's Committees need to be encouraged to mitigate against ongoing development activities that encroach upon protected areas where Delacour's langurs occur.\n\n    \n  ""]",Decreasing,"

    Habitat loss and poor water quality issues from point and non-point source pollution have plagued aquatic organisms within these streams for many decades   (R. Thoma, T. Jones and J. Cordeiro pers. comm. 2009). While efforts are currently underway to improve water quality in a few streams, much of the watershed continues to suffer from historical surface coal mining practices   (R. Thoma, T. Jones and J. Cordeiro pers. comm. 2009). Although much of the East Fork Obey River system remains forested, increasing residential development, logging, and agricultural practices pose continuing threats. Note there is the potential (not realized) threat of a large sand mine being considered for construction in the heart of the range of this species (R. Thoma to C. Taylor pers. comm. 2008).

    This species is threatened mainly by hunting and commercial logging (Whittaker 2006), as well as by conversion to oil palm plantations and forest clearing and product extraction by local people (Whittaker 2006). Only 10-15% of the original forest cover remains on Sipora (Fuentes 1996/1997). Recently, hunting pressure has increased because of improved access to remote areas due to logging roads and tracks, as well as the replacement of bows and arrows with .177 caliber air rifles (anything larger is illegal in Indonesia) (Whittaker 2006). Also, local rituals and taboos that formerly regulated hunting have been replaced by Christianity (Whittaker 2006). The pet trade is also a threat to this species (Whittaker 2006). Though this species is not a preferred food item, it is still hunted and poisoned as it is considered a crop pest (Whittaker 2006). While habitat disturbance appears to positively affect population densities, it is found in lower densities near human settlements (Whittaker 2006).

    The relatively low human density and footprint, the lack of transport routes and an abrupt topography have allowed parts of the region where this species was thought to be collected, to remain intact. Other parts have greatly suffered from habitat loss and general degradation due to human activities. Both the Yungas and dry montane forests, in the department of La Paz, are considered to be in a critical conservation state. Current threats to plant species in the region include slash and burn and logging for cultivation of cash crops (subsistence agriculture, cocoa, coffee and  Coca), inappropriate and harmful agricultural techniques, road construction (e.g., construction of the Cotapata-Santa Barbara highway which is having a huge ecological impact), wildfires, gold mining, population extinctions due to reduced size and isolation, human colonization, timber exploitation, tourism, dam construction, landslides, waste disposal and pollution. Climate change may affect the distribution and composition of montane plants communities. It is not known how these threats would directly affect the population this taxon as its biology and ecology  have not been studied.

    
  ","['\n    Bolivia is the poorest country of South America and poverty and development lead to biodiversity degradation and loss. Although conservation efforts have evolved rapidly, they are hindered by accelerating economic development and a high level of social conflicts (Ibisch 2005). Although the department of La Paz is an important centre of plant diversity and endemism and harbours many rare and threatened species, there is only one protected area within the potential range of this species, in the Yungas, and none in the dry montane forest (LÃ³pez and Zambrana-Torrelio 2006). The Cotapata National Park was created in 1993 to mitigate the ecological impact of the Cotapata-Santa Barbara highway. An inventory of the flora of the park is in progress but has not yet been completed, with about two thirds of the species not yet investigated. ParksWatch considers the Cotapata PN-ANMI as vulnerable because it is too small and isolated and recommend to extend the surface of the park so that it is biologically viable (de Boissieu 2005). Field surveys need to be conducted in potentially suitable areas (i.e., around 2,750 m altitudinal zone, in the department of La Paz) to confirm whether this species still occurs and, if so, to estimate its range and population size. The biology, ecology and dynamics of the population should be studied as well as its resilience to anthropogenic disturbances. Raising awareness among local communities on the value of these ecosystems and management of tourism are essential.\n\n    \n  ']",Unknown,"

    Deforestation due to shifting cultivation has been responsible for most of the destruction of the original forests on the lower and middle mountain slopes of northern Venezuela. Deforestation is also caused by construction of tourist and recreation resorts in the vicinity of the larger cities, which also involves intensive road building into previously inaccessible areas. The area around Tovar, where the taxon was collected over 150 years ago, has dramatically changed since then, being very close to the capital of the country, Caracas, however reasonable size forest patches still remain. The selective extraction of some plants of commercial value is threatening several orchid and tree fern species in this region. The only known locality of this species is only approximately 40 km from the capital. It is therefore likely that this area is/was heavily collected for these purposes.

    This species was collected in low numbers but with some apparent regularity prior to the introduction of Small Indian Mongoose to St. Croix in the late 19th Century, and predation by this invasive mammal ""undoubtedly explains"" the absence of records from St. Croix since 1883 despite intensive survey work in the Virgin Islands during the 20th Century (Hedges and Conn 2012). Green Cay, where the species might survive, is a wildlife refuge, however, Black Rats occur on this island and may represent a threat to any surviving population (Hedges and Conn 2012) given the very small size of the cay, which may not be able to sustain a substantial population of these large skinks. Surveys on Green Cay over the past decade have not recorded this species (Hedges and Conn 2012). Hedges and Conn (2012) hypothesize that habitat destruction resulting from agricultural and urban expansion may threaten any surviving population on St. Croix, however, the available evidence that the species is extinct on St. Croix suggests that these processes cannot be considered major threats.

Eradication of mongoose from an island as large as St. Croix is not possible (Hedges and Conn 2012), but eradicating rats from Green Cay may be (Hedges and Conn 2012) and this effort is likely to benefit any surviving population of this species. Following the recent recognition of ', <em>Spondylurus magnacruzae</em>, ' as a distinct species endemic to St. Croix, studies are needed to determine if a population survives, and if so to evaluate the health of that population (Hedges and Conn 2012).

    Mongoose predation has been implicated as the cause of this lizard's disappearance from St. Thomas and probably also from St. John, two of the largest US Virgin Islands (Hedges and Conn 2012, Platenberg and Bouton 2006). Mongoose are widespread in the British Virgin Islands, making this invasive species a cause of particular concern (Perry and Gerber 2006). Most recent records of this species are from mongoose-free islands, although there are recent records from Tortola where mongoose are found (Hedges and Conn 2012). Introduction of mongoose, either deliberately or by storm transport, to these remaining islands is a ""significant probability"" (S.B. Hedges pers. comm. 2013). Agricultural and urban development in the British Virgin Islands is likely to further reduce available habitat for a species already excluded from much of its historical range by exotic species, and it may be susceptible to predation by other exotic mammals such as black rats (Hedges and Conn 2012).

    This species occurs in an area with a high human population density and main road access. It is threatened outside Biotopo del Quetzal by land clearance for subsistence farming and the commercial cultivation of ornamental ferns for export to Japan. A forest fragment outside the reserve where this species was recorded is entirely surrounded by cleared land  (C. VÃ¡squez AlmazÃ¡n pers. comm. March 2011). The edges of the reserve itself are under increasing pressure from human encroachment from both the resident population and new communities migrating into the area. The extraction of timber from forest at the reserve edge is widespread, and in some areas so intensive that the forest is completely cleared and subsequently converted to agriculture (C. VÃ¡squez AlmazÃ¡n pers. comm. March 2011). Forests further into the reserve are exploited for ferns and other forest products (C. VÃ¡squez AlmazÃ¡n pers. comm. March 2011). The pathogenic amphibian chytrid fungus has been detected in this area (C. VÃ¡squez AlmazÃ¡n pers. comm. March 2011), but its effects on these direct-developing salamanders are unknown. It has been reported that weather patterns in the region are already changing, with a higher incidence of warm days, an absence of days with continuous light rain, and less morning and afternoon mist (C. VÃ¡squez AlmazÃ¡n pers. comm. March 2011). The effects of these changes in temperature and humidity on the Sierra de las Minas hidden salamander are unknown, and there is currently no evidence that climate change is affecting this species (C. VÃ¡squez AlmazÃ¡n pers. comm. March 2011). However, the difficulty in finding these animals in drier conditions suggests that this species is highly sensitive to humidity, and as it is wholly reliant on good-quality cloud forest it will be rapidly driven to extinction if climate change modifies this habitat beyond its ability to persist.

    
  ","[""\n    This salamander's cloud forest habitat within the Biotopo del Quetzal is well protected, but enforcement is needed to preserve forest close to the edge of the reserve and to limit collection of ferns within the protected area.

    The management of brooks in Albania and Greece is very poor. The natural situation of brooks is, in many cases, destroyed for irrigation purposes and concrete channels often replace brooks. Further threats are water pollution and too intensive management (e.g. the clearing of all riparian vegetation). In recent years climate change has become one of the main threats and during recent hot and dry summers several brooks in Greece where found to be dry. Information on this for the sites where the species occurs is lacking, it is however likely that at least some of its populations were affected by the dry periods.

    Areas on Anegada that once contained dense populations of iguanas now support few or none.  Research indicates that this is due to three major causes, including competitive grazing pressure from free-ranging livestock, predation by feral dogs, and predation of juveniles by feral cats.Â Competition with livestock for food is the principal reason, although predation, habitat loss and a multiple year drought are also having a negative impact.

In the absence of introduced predators, however, the iguanas appear to do well and reproduce in areas that are free of sheep (the only feral grazing competitor present).  Currently, approximately 20 adult iguanas are estimated to inhabit Guana.  Offspring have been seen each year since 1987, but recruitment is very low over much of the island.

    The major threats to Ricordâ??s iguanas are from human activities resulting in habitat reduction and degradation (clearing of vegetation for agricultural use, charcoal production, harvesting of fuelwood and hardwoods, overbrowsing by free-ranging livestock, mining of limestone, illegal collection of live cacti for local and international trade), in combination with local subsistence hunting for food and predation from introduced carnivores (dogs, cats and mongooses).  Competition from mammalian herbivores probably also occurs.  Hunting of Ricordâ??s iguanas for food and trade has increased gradually since the mid 1970s, both for local consumption as well as at a few oriental restaurants in Santo Domingo where iguanas were offered as a speciality dish.  In the past, some hunters used to set up to 100 snare traps per day at the entrance of retreats, with 30-50% trapping success.  Although current populations no longer support the numbers harvested 15 years ago, iguanas continue to be captured opportunistically in all areas with remaining populations, except on Isla Cabritos where law enforcement is presently effective.

Recommendations for the long-term conservation of the Hirola in Kenya have been included in a conservation action plan (Magin 1996) and a conservation evaluation report (Butynski 1999). These recommendations are now part of the current conservation and management plan for the Hirola in Kenya (Hirola Management Committee 2004) and are being acted upon by the Kenya Wildlife Service, in conjunction with the Hirola Management Committee and local conservation NGOs. There is an urgent need to improve the level of management and protection of the one natural population of Hirola, particularly in the Arawale National Reserve and in the Galma Galla/Kolbio region of Kenya. Community conservation and anti-poaching activities must be established over a large portion of the remaining range, but insecurity for conservation workers is an extremely serious problem in this region. Consideration should be given to establishing protected areas at Galma Galla and Lag Dere, and to expanding the Tana Primate National Reserve to the east to include at least 300 kmÂ² of prime habitat for Hirola (Butynski in press).

Due to increased tourism, in the course of a single year (2006) two plantations were razed of which one was observed to have at least 70 individuals. All the spiders were killed by the loggers while razing the plantation. Due to their skewed sex ratio, and the difference in maturity rates between males and females, small populations with less than 5,000 individuals have a very high probability of extinction within the next three to four decades (S.

    The two principal threats are poaching and reduced population viability. Hunting is primarily driven by the demand for the supposedly medicinal properties of rhino horns and other body parts, and many centuries of over-hunting has reduced this species to a tiny percentage of its former population and range. The species is now so reduced that there are very small numbers in each locality where it still survives. As a result, breeding activity is infrequent, successful births are uncommon in many populations, and there is a severe risk of inbreeding depression (J. Payne pers. comm.). The species is frequently stated to be sensitive to habitat disturbance (van Strien, 1986), but timber extraction is of little or no significance to the species, as it is robust enough to withstand more or less any forest condition (J. Payne pers. comm.).

    
  ","['\n    The species has been included on CITES Appendix I since 1975, and legally protected in all range states.  An extensive international co-operative programme for the conservation of this species is being implemented with ', <em>in situ</em>, ' activities being conducted in Indonesia and Malaysia. The primary objectives are to develop and deploy effective anti-poaching teams and to provide the co-ordination capacity to manage and sustain the programme. Rhino Protection Units (RPU) have been a ', <em>force majeur</em>, ' in stopping poaching in Sumatra. Many organizations are involved with these units, including the Government of Indonesia (Sectionov and Waladi pers. comm.). The expansion and reinforcement of anti-poaching programmes is the top priority if this species is to survive.', <br/>, <br/>, 'There are also ongoing efforts to develop managed breeding centers for the species in Indonesia and Malaysia.

    This species appears to have an extremely limited distribution, despite extensive searches (Horwitz 1990). Virtually nothing is known of the ecology, population dynamics and habitat requirements of the species. It is thought indigenous vegetation removal, cattle trampling of both the ground and creek banks and alteration of the water table may adversely affect this species (Morey 2004). Most of the creek frontage at the known locations is unfenced and where cattle have had unrestricted access to creeks in the catchment, the understorey is virtually absent. Cattle has been grazed in the area for the past 100 years (B. Whiting pers. comm. to J. Morey undated). Cattle may have affected this species by compacting the ground and possibly collapsing burrows as well as causing streamside erosion, bank damage and loss of native vegetation. Gold-mining was apparently conducted along the creek and its tributaries earlier this century. Rock is still mined within the catchment. It is not known how critical the persistence of native vegetation is to the survival of the species (Morey 2004). The only known current locations of the species are on Labertouche Creek and Wattle Creek (a tributary of Labertouche Creek) in West Gippsland (Morey 2004). This means that if the Labertouche Creek were to become polluted the Wattle Creek population may also be affected.

    
  ","['\n    This species has been listed as a threatened taxon in Schedule 2 of the Flora and Fauna Guarantee Act 1988. In its final recommendation, the Scientific Advisory Committee (SAC 1993) determined that this species is significantly prone to future threats which are likely to result in extinction (Morey 2004).

    This species is sensitive to changing water quality and physical disruption. It is therefore threatened by habitat alteration and pollution from strip mine runoff and coal washing. Intensive industrial and agricultural development of the Tennessee Valley since the early 1900s has had a significant impact upon the mussel fauna inhabiting the Tennessee River basin.  Dam construction in the upper Tennessee River system may have been the most significant factor.  Dams were constructed for hydroelectric power, flood control, and navigation, as well as recreation.  Siltation has also impacted the species (from strip mining, coal mining, road construction, forestry and agricultural operations).  Pollution is also a factor, from heavy metals, industrial effluent, chemical spills, agricultural waste, fertilizers, pesticides, and human waste (USFWS 1984).  Populations in the North Fork of Holston and Clinch rivers were reduced by toxic discharges and spills prior to 1972. Some sizable populations in the Elk River were destroyed by impoundment of Tims Ford Reservoir. The invasion of the Asian clam, and the possible invasion of the zebra mussel, also threaten remaining populations.
