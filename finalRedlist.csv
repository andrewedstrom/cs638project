However, the species and its habitats continue to be impacted by excessive sediment bed loads of smaller sediment particles, changes in turbidity, increased suspended solids (primarily resulting from nonpoint-source loading from poor land-use practices, lack of BMPs, and maintenance of existing BMPs), and pesticides. Other primarily localized impacts include gravel mining, reduced water quality below dams, developmental activities, water withdrawal, impoundments, and alien species. Toxic spills are also a possibility in all extant populations (USFWS 2003).  Siltation from poorly conducted agricultural and silvicultural activities; chicken farm litter nutrients; localized industrial, municipal, and residential pollution; watershed development (bridge, highway construction projects, etc.), urban sprawl in upper Flint and Chattahoochee may impact potential populations; competition from Asian Clam is a possibility. Chicken farms and silvicultural activities are on the increase in southeastern Alabama, thus threatening stream habitat there. It is not tolerant of impoundments.

Although this invasive species has been known from the island for 150 years, an irruption was first detected in the west of Savai'i in 2012 (R. Fisher pers. comm. 2013). Due to a shortage of surveys it is not clear when this irruption began. On this island, the lizard appears to have disappeared from areas below 500 m in areas where ants have irrupted, and can no longer be found in apparently optimal habitat (R. Fisher pers. comm. 2012). No information is available on the status or distribution of invasive ants in eastern Savai'i, or any effects on lizard subpopulations (R. Fisher pers. comm. 2013). Predation by cats and rats is also considered a major threat. In American Samoa, there may be some risk from urbanization outside the territory's only national park (R. Fisher pers. comm. 2013).

    Threatened by illegal hunting, destruction of montane forest and heathlands, encroachment by cattle, expansion of high-altitude cultivation, roads, and harassment by dogs. Permanent occupation of suitable habitat as a result of increasing human and livestock populations is exerting tremendous pressure on nyala habitat throughout the range, with anecdotal evidence suggesting mountain nyalas actively avoid livestock (Sillero-Zubiri in press). Mountain Nyalas are extensively hunted for meat and horns, the latter used for local medicine and to make nipples for traditional milk bottles. Trophy hunting blocks in Arsi have been hunted out and concessions moved to Bale, with continued pressure by the industry for additional hunting blocks and larger quotas. Effects of current trophy-hunting programs are not well understood and current trophy hunting quotas may be unsustainable in the long-term (Sillero-Zubiri in press).

Sustainable trophy hunting in some of these areas has very high potential for generating the revenue needed to fund effective conservation of this species and the other endemics which share its habitat.

The species is believed to have become extinct on Kolombangara because of extensive logging operations between 1966 and 1980 (Flannery 1995; Parnaby 2002). There is some local hunting of this species, and while it is currently not intensively hunted, the hunting pressure on this species is predicted to rise with the increasing human population of the Solomon Islands (Flannery 1995; Parnaby 2002). It occurs in accessible areas near coastal villages, and is easily caught (Fisher and Tasker 1997).

    Habitat conversion poses the most serious threat to the Houston toad. Several populations were eliminated with the expansion of Houston, and the largest remaining population in Bastrop County is also under intense and immediate threat from urbanization and recreational over-development. Many Houston toads are killed each year by automobiles. Roadway mortality will increase as human populations continue to increase within the speciesÂ_Â—Ãˆ habitat and as the habitat continues to be dissected by more roads. Road construction further isolates populations and disrupts or prevents the movement of individual toads between populations. This movement of toads is necessary to maintain gene flow, and thus genetic diversity, and to supplement small or declining local populations. It is possible to build roads with underpasses or other structures that allow toads and other wildlife to pass safely beneath the roads. While converting woodlands to pastures or ploughed fields destroys Houston toad habitat and favours the proliferation of other toad species, certain agricultural practices can be beneficial to Houston toads. These include maintaining low to moderate numbers of livestock to avoid overgrazing, protecting pond habitat from livestock and predatory fish, planting native bunchgrasses instead of sod-forming grasses such as Bermuda grass (which are difficult for the toads to move through), and conserving large blocks of woodlands. Certain forestry practices may benefit the Houston toad, while others, such as clear cutting, are harmful. Thinning and burning have been shown to benefit some species of amphibians and reptiles by opening up the forest canopy and allowing more sunlight to reach the forest floor. This practice encourages the growth of vegetation and, in turn, increases insect numbers. This may be beneficial to the Houston toad. Other threats that often appear in conjunction with the factors outlined above include prolonged drought and the presence of fire ants, an unwelcome species from Brazil. Fire ants have been observed preying on toadlets as they leave their breeding pond. Fire ants thrive in open, sunny areas where the soil has been disturbed and woody vegetation uprooted, as in agricultural fields and urban areas. Protecting large forested areas is one of the most effective deterrents to fire ants. Where fire ant control with pesticides is necessary, mounds should be treated individually, rather than broadcasting the chemicals, to avoid impacting other invertebrates that the Houston toad eats (see http://ifw2es.fws.gov/HoustonToad).

    
  ","['\n    The Houston toad was the first amphibian granted protection under the U.S. Endangered Species Act. A critical habitat was designated in 1978 in Bastrop and Burleson counties, in areas supporting the largest populations known at that time. However, the population within critical habitat in Burleson County has not been seen since 1983. In the 1970s, the state of Texas acquired land within designated critical habitat in Bastrop County adjacent to Buescher and Bastrop state parks to aid in conservation. Additionally, an effort was started in 1978 by the Houston Zoo to identify remaining Houston toad populations and supplement them or establish new populations in protected areas using wild-caught adults, naturally deposited eggs, or captive-reared juveniles and adults. However, new populations were not established in spite of introducing over 500,000 individuals (adults, juveniles, larvae) into sites at the Attwater Prairie Chicken National Wildlife Refuge. Research is urgently needed to determine the status of Houston toad populations outside Bastrop County and promote conservation efforts in these areas. Research is also critical to determine which management practices are most conducive to the Houston toad and the ecosystem on which it depends. The Houston Toad Recovery Plan was published by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) in 1984. The Texas Parks and Wildlife Department and the USFWS have jointly prepared a brochure for private landowners who wish to implement their agricultural practices in ways that are compatible with the needs of the Houston toad and the Texas Forest Service has formed a committee to develop management practices that protect the Houston toad and its habitat. Additionally, the USFWS is working with community leaders, private landowners, and conservation organizations to develop and implement a regional Habitat Conservation Plan for Bastrop County, which would provide for the issuance of endangered species permits that allow development to proceed while ensuring permanent habitat protection. The USFWS also has established a fund with the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation to assist in local habitat protection efforts for the Houston toad.\n\n    \n  ']",Decreasing,"

    Leading hypotheses for the declines are disease (chytridiomycosis), airborne contaminants, and livestock grazing. An examination of preserved specimens from a 1970 die-off found multiple pathogens, but no single pathogen was present in more than 25% of the specimens, suggesting that the animals suffered from suppressed immune systems (Green and Kagarise Sherman 2001). Davidson, Shaffer and Jennings (2002) found a weak pattern between declines at sites and amount of agricultural land upwind (suggesting that windborne agrochemicals may have contributed to declines). Livestock grazing may have detrimental impacts on Yosemite Toads through trampling, alteration of meadow habitat, and possible lowered water quality (D. Martin pers. comm.). Other factors that may have contributed to declines are the 1980s California drought, and predation by introduced trout. Ultraviolet radiation is not suspected to be a major contributor to declines based on fieldwork by Sadinski (pers. comm.).

Off-highway vehicle use, pack stock and cattle grazing still occur in National Forests, as well as protected wilderness areas; only pack stock use continues in Yosemite National Park and Kings Canyon National Park. Because declines have occurred in pristine areas in parks, no occurrences can be regarded as adequately protected. This species has been federally petitioned for listing under the Endangered Species Act in March 2000 by the Pacific Rivers Council and Centre for Biological Diversity. In December 2002 the US Fish and Wildlife Service published a decision in the Federal Register that placed the toad on the ""warranted-but-precluded"" list due to higher priority listings.

Similarly, erosion and subsequent siltation may cover seepage areas if future logging or clearing occurs. Roads and cuttings can alter the water quality and hydrology and may affect seepage areas and first order streams.

    The desiccation and pollution of the canal system and lakes in Xochimilco and Chalco, as a result of urbanization, as well as the traditional consumption of the species by local people, is threatening the survival of this species. Increased tourist activity is poorly regulated and adds further pollution (Zambrano, 2006). The species is also captured for medicinal purposes. The harvesting is targeted at animals that are less than one year old. It was formerly also captured for the international pet trade, although probably all animals in the international trade are now of captive origin. Introduced fishes (tilapia and carp) have increased to high abundances (a recent study collected 600kg of tilapia in one small channel using a 100m net) and have also impacted axolotls through competition and predation. The animals are also being affected by disease, probably spread by invasive species, and as a result of poor water quality. Although the water regime has changed in the last 10 years, and it is reported that pollution levels are decreasing, factors such as very high levels of bacterial contamination could still pose a serious threat.

    
  ","['\n    Conservation action is focusing on raising the profile of Lake Xochimilco through conservation education and a nature tourism initiative, coupled with work on habitat restoration and bioremediation.

    The reason(s) for the decline of this species are unknown, although chytridiomycosis must be strongly suspected. The habitat of the species in the Wet Tropics has been protected since 1988; therefore, habitat destruction is no longer a threat (McDonald and Alford 1999). Current research is examining the possibility that disease, such as a viral and infection or chytrid fungus, might have contributed to the decline of this species (Berger, Speare and Hyatt 1999). Feral pigs have been suggested as a potential cause of riparian habitat damage and adult frog mortality (Richards, McDonald and Alford 1993). However, feral pigs are unlikely to have a direct impact due to the close association of this species with rocky cascades in streams (M. Cunningham pers. comm.).

    It is unknown what threats impacted on this species in the past. It has been postulated that an extended drought in the early 1930s which is known to have drastically lowered the water levels in the already shallow Utah Lake, combined with harsh winters that caused the lake to freeze to the bottom, would probably have killed all but the hardiest of organisms living there. The early 1930s is also the time at which endemic fish and snail species became extinct in Lake Utah (K. Perez pers. comm. 2011). Low water levels would also have greatly increased the alkalinity of the lake which may have also contributed to the decline of this species (Oliver and Bosworth III 1999).

    Hunting for the purposes of traditional ""medicine"" is the primary threat facing this species; most of the populations that survive are heavily reduced and fragmented. Only the subpopulation at Van Long, with about 50 individuals, is thought likely to survive given the current hunting pressure; however, quarrying for limestone (cement), which is currently taking place there, has affected the ranging behaviour of the animals (T. Nadler pers. comm.). The smallest groups are extremely unlikely to survive should the one reproductively active male be taken or killed (Nadler 2004). Forest loss is a more minor threat as it occurs in degraded areas. A potential threat is the rapid development of tourist facilities adjacent to protected areas, especially around Van Long and Hoa Lu Nature Reserves.

    
  ","[""\n    This species is currently listed only as CITES Appendix II. It is considered 'endangered' in Viet Nam, and is listed as a 'most endangered' species under Annex 1B of Decree 32 (2006). It occurs in six protected areas, but many still experience high hunting pressure. Van Long Nature Reserve was established for this species in 2001, and there has been some evidence of population growth in this reserve in the past five years. The connection of forest fragments in some already protected areas, such as Van Long, could greatly increase the size and survivability of some subpopulations. Also considered as beneficial population management for this species are the translocation of severely threatened (small) groups to safe and suitable habitat, and the augmentation of existing groups with offspring from a captive population. Delacour's langurs have been successfully kept and bred in captivity at the Endangered Primate Rescue Center in Cuc Phuong National Park, Viet Nam, which is currently the only collection keeping this species (Nadler 2004).

    This species is threatened mainly by hunting and commercial logging (Whittaker 2006), as well as by conversion to oil palm plantations and forest clearing and product extraction by local people (Whittaker 2006). Only 10-15% of the original forest cover remains on Sipora (Fuentes 1996/1997). Recently, hunting pressure has increased because of improved access to remote areas due to logging roads and tracks, as well as the replacement of bows and arrows with .177 caliber air rifles (anything larger is illegal in Indonesia) (Whittaker 2006). Also, local rituals and taboos that formerly regulated hunting have been replaced by Christianity (Whittaker 2006). The pet trade is also a threat to this species (Whittaker 2006). Though this species is not a preferred food item, it is still hunted and poisoned as it is considered a crop pest (Whittaker 2006).

    This species was collected in low numbers but with some apparent regularity prior to the introduction of Small Indian Mongoose to St. Croix in the late 19th Century, and predation by this invasive mammal ""undoubtedly explains"" the absence of records from St. Croix since 1883 despite intensive survey work in the Virgin Islands during the 20th Century (Hedges and Conn 2012). Green Cay, where the species might survive, is a wildlife refuge, however, Black Rats occur on this island and may represent a threat to any surviving population (Hedges and Conn 2012) given the very small size of the cay, which may not be able to sustain a substantial population of these large skinks. Surveys on Green Cay over the past decade have not recorded this species (Hedges and Conn 2012). Hedges and Conn (2012) hypothesize that habitat destruction resulting from agricultural and urban expansion may threaten any surviving population on St. Croix, however, the available evidence that the species is extinct on St. Croix suggests that these processes cannot be considered major threats.

    Mongoose predation has been implicated as the cause of this lizard's disappearance from St. Thomas and probably also from St. John, two of the largest US Virgin Islands (Hedges and Conn 2012, Platenberg and Bouton 2006).

Most recent records of this species are from mongoose-free islands, although there are recent records from Tortola where mongoose are found (Hedges and Conn 2012). Introduction of mongoose, either deliberately or by storm transport, to these remaining islands is a ""significant probability"" (S.B. Hedges pers. comm. 2013).

Competition from mammalian herbivores probably also occurs.  Hunting of RicordÂ_Â—Ãˆs iguanas for food and trade has increased gradually since the mid 1970s, both for local consumption as well as at a few oriental restaurants in Santo Domingo where iguanas were offered as a speciality dish.  In the past, some hunters used to set up to 100 snare traps per day at the entrance of retreats, with 30-50% trapping success.

    The use of the dunes by offroad vehicles has been a major threat in the past, but recently two conservation areas have been established, where the use of offroad vehicles was prohibited. Outside these areas offroad vehicles still pose a threat. The low population estimates in some years followed low rainfall amounts in prior years. Most climate models project increased summer temperatures, longer heat waves and an increased probability of drought in the area. Therefore, climate change seems to represent a threat to this species (Gowan and Knisley 2014).

    The two principal threats are poaching and reduced population viability. Hunting is primarily driven by the demand for the supposedly medicinal properties of rhino horns and other body parts, and many centuries of over-hunting has reduced this species to a tiny percentage of its former population and range. The species is now so reduced that there are very small numbers in each locality where it still survives. As a result, breeding activity is infrequent, successful births are uncommon in many populations, and there is a severe risk of inbreeding depression (J. Payne pers. comm.). The species is frequently stated to be sensitive to habitat disturbance (van Strien, 1986), but timber extraction is of little or no significance to the species, as it is robust enough to withstand more or less any forest condition (J.

Virtually nothing is known of the ecology, population dynamics and habitat requirements of the species. It is thought indigenous vegetation removal, cattle trampling of both the ground and creek banks and alteration of the water table may adversely affect this species (Morey 2004). Most of the creek frontage at the known locations is unfenced and where cattle have had unrestricted access to creeks in the catchment, the understorey is virtually absent. Cattle has been grazed in the area for the past 100 years (B. Whiting pers. comm. to J. Morey undated). Cattle may have affected this species by compacting the ground and possibly collapsing burrows as well as causing streamside erosion, bank damage and loss of native vegetation. Gold-mining was apparently conducted along the creek and its tributaries earlier this century. Rock is still mined within the catchment. It is not known how critical the persistence of native vegetation is to the survival of the species (Morey 2004). The only known current locations of the species are on Labertouche Creek and Wattle Creek (a tributary of Labertouche Creek) in West Gippsland (Morey 2004).
