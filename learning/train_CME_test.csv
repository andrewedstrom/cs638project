    In the past, extensive deforestation took place over much of Puerto Rico due to agricultural expansion and wood-cutting; current disturbances include tourism and infrastructure development for tourism and radio communication facilities. As a high-altitude species, it might also be susceptible to climate change and/or chytridiomycosis. Rats and mongooses have also been suggested as potential threats (as invasive predators), although literature on this subject is equivocal (Hedges, 1993, and Thurley and Bell, 1994, support the notion that these introduced species comprise threats to amphibian species, while Reagan and Waide, 1996, suggest that rats are lesser predators of Eleutherodactylus coqui), and there is currently no consensus regarding the impact that these species may or may not have on amphibian declines in Puerto Rico. Future research efforts directed at investigating the impact of these invasive species on amphibian populations may help to elucidate their relative contribution to amphibian declines.

Habitat degradation and conversion to developments for tourism human settlements and road construction are particularly severe problems while predation from introduced mammals such as rats and mongoose also threatens many native species (6). As a result of these threats the range of the Virgin Islands coqui has become highly fragmented and there is an ongoing decline in the quality of its habitat.

However trade is very difficult to regulate as there is no requirement for internationally traded <i>Nepenthes</i> to be identified down to species level and plants simply labelled as <i>Nepenthes </i>accounted for 94 percent of all exported <i>Nepenthes </i>plants between 1988 and 1993.

As the Olifants River region experiences hot dry summers water is extracted from the main river and its tributaries to irrigate the surrounding agricultural land.  Impoundments are also constructed to store water after the winter rainy season.

It has recently been seen in unprotected forest patches between Analamerana and Ankarana, and is present in the Andavakoera Classified Forest, but probably in very low numbers. There is an urgent need for a full-time, long-term scientific presence in the Analamerana Special Reserve, as well as an expansion of this protected area to include the forests of Andriafiamena and a connection to Ankarana.

Vast tracts of their habitat have been cleared and the isolated patches of forest that remain are under pressure from logging and bush fires (2). The species is also hunted in some areas (2) and the recent discovery of gold in the region has resulted in an influx of miners causing further habitat loss and the hunting of lemurs for food (4).,Recent studies have shown that these sifakas are fairly abundant in some of the remaining forest fragments within their range and estimates put the population at between 6200 and 10000 individuals (7). Based on these figures it has been suggested that the World Conservation Union (IUCN) should reclassify the species as Endangered (7). At present the captive population of golden-crowned sifakas numbers just three at the Duke University Primate Centre (4). The species does not currently occur within a protected area (2) but is listed under Class A of the African Convention on the Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources whereby hunting killing capture or collection of individuals is forbidden unless for scientific purposes and with permission (6). A network of protected areas has been proposed to conserve the remaining forest fragments in which the golden-crowned sifaka is found (7).,loss;hunting;,protected;,2,1,yes,3171387,5387,400,0,0.07425283089,4,0.0,0.14285714289999998,0.5,0.3333333333,0.680952381,12.0,0.4285714286,3.0,8.0,1.0,1,1,1.0,0,1.0,9,9,0.3823529412,0.5,0.3333333333,0.8804347826000001,8,0.6521739129999999,12,13,0,1,1,1,1,1,yes,1,0

The construction of communication towers on Cerro de Punta is thought to have destroyed a large part of the original population with further development and construction activities being cited as the main threat to the remaining plants (1) (3). The highly restricted range of CookÃÂ¢??s holly also makes it extremely vulnerable to natural disturbances such as landslides and hurricanes (2).,CookÃÂ¢??s holly was listed on the US Endangered Species Act in 1987 and a Recovery Plan was drawn up by the US Fish and Wildlife Service in 1991 (1) (2). Several necessary actions were outlined in the plan including: the protection and monitoring of existing populations; the undertaking of research into the speciesÃÂ¢?? life history and reproductive biology; and the propagation of seedlings for the enhancement of existing populations and the establishment of new ones (2). However since none of these measures appear to have been implemented thus far (5) an up-to-date evaluation of the condition of the remaining plants seems to be seriously overdue.,,endangered species act;,0,1,yes,8874923,2208,1121,0,0.5076992754,4,0.0,,,,,,,,,1.0,1,1,1.0,0,1.0,13,13,0.1923076923,0.5,0.3333333333,0.8147727273,10,0.375,1,5,0,1,1,1,1,1,yes,1,0

The drop in numbers is probably attributable to a range of threats including habitat loss and poaching by hunters who are trafficking exotic animals (2). Most devastating however has been the introduction of alien species (5). Feral dogs first reported in 1994 are known to kill adult iguanas and predation by an exploding population of feral cats on juveniles is responsible for the deaths of many hatchlings each year (2) (5). The primary threat however comes from competition for food from feral livestock with the island teeming with sheep goats donkeys and cattle that have been released to roam freely across Anegada (2) (4). Grazing pressure from these livestock has radically changed the composition of vegetation available to the iguana shifting the speciesÃÂ¢?? diet to rely more on plants with secondary compounds with dubious nutritional value (2).,The Anegada Iguana Recovery Programme began in 1997 which included establishing a ÃÂ¢??headstartÃÂ¢?? facility. This facility collects hatchlings and nurtures them in captivity until they can be safely released into the wild with the aim of combating the high rates of juvenile mortality due to cat predation by raising them until they are large enough that predation will not pose as great a threat (6). The first 24 were released into the wild in October 2003 with an 84 percent survival rate and a second group of 24 were released in October 2004 and these are currently being tracked (5). In the 1980s small numbers of these iguanas were removed from Anegada and restored to parts of their former range on Guana Island where the species appears to be doing well in the absence of introduced predators (1) (2). The Guana Island Wildlife Sanctuary continues to try to rid the island of sheep the only feral grazing competitor on the island which may improve the habitat there for the iguanas (1). The species was also later introduced to Necker Island (2). A national park designed to protect this Critically Endangered iguana on Anegada has been approved in principle by the Anegada Lands Committee but rampant debates over land ownership and property boundaries impede developments and must be resolved before this project can progress (2) (4). Further conservation actions advocated include a cat eradication programme and the construction of fences around protected areas to keep livestock out. Indeed despite the successes of the headstart programme it is imperative that efforts are made to control livestock and to secure protected land for the survival of this species. Without prompt action it has been suggested that these iguanas may become extinct on Anegada within the next decade (2).,loss;poaching;pet;,protected;,3,1,yes,7974916,4511,1007,0,0.2232320993,4,0.0,0.1368421053,0.3202563076,0.14285714289999998,0.6082309582,127.0,0.14189189189999998,-105.0,15.0,1.0,1,1,1.0,0,1.0,9,9,0.32,0.5,0.3333333333,0.8761904762,5,0.6666666667,9,10,0,1,1,1,1,1,yes,1,0

In the Philippines large areas of forest had already been cleared by the end of the nineteenth century for agricultural expansion which continued throughout the twentieth century (7). However the most extensive and rapid deforestation in the latter half of the century has been caused by commercial logging with has particularly impacted the valuable primary lowland dipterocarp forests which shrunk from an estimated 10 million hectares in the 1950s to only one million by the late 1980s (7). Forest clearance and habitat degradation throughout Borneo and the Philippines may also be having a detrimental effect on the treeÃÂ¢??s natural pollinators reducing the rate at which the species can reproduce and recover its populations (4).,This threatened species is located in a proposed reserve site (1) which if awarded official reserve status in the future would confer some degree of protection to the species. The PhilippinesÃÂ¢?? Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR) has also established a <strong>genebank</strong> of economically useful <strong>endemic</strong> and endangered forest tree species including white seraya (8). This project has involved collecting and propagating the species to be maintained in an arboretum and gathering data on growth and survival of the species planted (8). A large scale project has also been initiated in Sabah Malaysia to rehabilitate 25000 hectares of logged forests using indigenous tree species such as dipterocarps in order to counteract atmospheric carbon dioxide (9). <i>Parashorea malaanonan</i> has been one of the main dipterocarp species planted to date (9). Indeed although such conservation efforts are not directed specifically at white seraya the tree is likely to benefit indirectly from a variety of such efforts to conserve lowland forests generally.

In Indonesia habitat destruction is a major problem as a result of illegal and commercial logging and large agricultural projects such as rubber and oil palm plantations (7).  Sumatra has a very high rate of habitat loss with some areas losing up to 65 percent of their forest cover in the last 25 years (8).ÃÂÃÂ Only 33.8 percent of Sumatra remains covered by <strong>primary forest</strong> and only 1.3 percent of this is upper montane vegetation in which <i>Nepenthes lavicola </i>is found.  The highly localised distribution of <i>Nepenthes lavicola</i> makes it particularly susceptible to the impacts of habitat disturbance or catastrophic environmental events such as drought or fire.  In addition highland plants such as <i>Nepenthes lavicola</i> take longer than lowland plants to recover from any disturbance as growth is slower (2).,<i>Nepenthes lavicola </i>is listed on Appendix II of the Convention of International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) which limits international trade in this species.  However this is very difficult to regulate.  Trade in <i>Nepenthes</i> species does not need to be identified down to species level and plants simply labelled as <i>Nepenthes </i>accounted for 94 percent of exported plants between 1988 and 1993.  This needs to be remedied and urgent attention is required to close other trade loopholes. Presently over-collection does not seem to pose an extensive threat for <i>Nepenthes lavicola</i> and artificial cultivation reduces this threat further (2).

Road kills may pose a significant threat particularly during the breeding season when the toads migrate to the breeding sites (1) (2) and urban development can also increase the physical barriers to such movements (2). In addition artificial water bodies with vertical sides such as swimming pools and stormwater drains can present death traps to toads while further threats at some breeding sites include pollution and introduced species such as predatory fish invasive plants and captive ducks which can consume eggs and tadpoles. The replacement of lawns and flowerbeds with stone and paving may also be reducing available foraging habitat (2) and there is increasing concern that the introduced guttural toad <i>Amietophrynus gutturalis</i> may compete with the western leopard toad for food and resources (8).

Habitat degradation and conversion to developments for tourism human settlements and road construction are particularly severe problems while predation from introduced mammals such as rats and mongoose also threatens many native species (6). As a result of these threats the range of the Virgin Islands coqui has become highly fragmented and there is an ongoing decline in the quality of its habitat. The small distinct population on Great Dog is particularly vulnerable. The Virgin Islands coqui also appears to be declining with the spread of the predatory Cuban tree frog (<em>Osteopilus septentrionalis</em>) (1).<em>ÃÂ  </em>,A number of conservation recommendations have been made to protect the native fauna of the British Virgin Islands including the creation of protected areas and minimising the impacts of development through the better enforcement of protective legislation. Increased monitoring efforts for amphibian populations may also be required given the potential for deadly diseases such as the fungus chytridiomycosis to break out on the island especially as disease has been associated with dramatic amphibian declines on nearby islands (6). Additional study and protection of the Virgin Islands coqui population on Great Dog is a conservation priority for the species while there is also a need to afford its habitat on Tortola and Virgin Gorda increased protection and control invasive predators (1) (6).,,protected;,0,1,yes,7281380,7495,919,0,0.1226150767,3,0.25,0.1458333333,0.0,0.0,0.5818191312,28.0,0.2631578947,-7.0,9.0,0.4074074074,0,0,0.7092667565999999,6,0.6842105262999999,9,11,0.4871794872,0.5,0.3333333333,0.9077441077,7,0.7407407407,19,19,0,1,1,1,1,1,yes,1,0

    Some areas were inundated by the Great Falls Reservoir in the 1910s. The habitat continues to be negatively affected by deterioration of water quality resulting from siltation, pesticides, and other pollutants contributed by coal mining, gravel mining, poor land use practices, and waste discharges (Layman and Mayden 2009). Spotty distribution in short river reaches makes the species vulnerable to local extirpation from accidental toxic chemical spills; natural recolonization of extirpated populations is greatly restricted or prevented by population fragmentation (resulting in part from impoundments).

The principle agent behind this decline was the creation of Greers Ferry Lake in 1962 which resulted in the inundation of downstream tributaries creating deep pools with increased sedimentation and lower oxygen levels in the water. As an inhabitant of shallow fast-moving streams the yellowcheek darter was displaced from much of its former range moving upstream to less suitable areas of habitat. The speciesÃÂ¢?? migratory behaviour was also disrupted while the loss of downstream refugia made the species more vulnerable to droughts resulting in the loss of many populations (7). Other threats such as the channelization of streams for agriculture and human consumption have isolated some populations and a loss of <strong>genetic diversity</strong> has been observed due to <strong>inbreeding</strong> (3) (8).,Having suffered such a severe decline the yellowcheek darter is in drastic need of major conservation measures. Indeed the species has been proposed for Threatened Status under the U.S Endangered Species Act (9). An agreement has also been made between several conservation organisations and landowners to mitigate threats to the species protect bordering terrestrial habitats; and explore potential reintroduction programmes (3).

    The management of brooks in Albania and Greece is very poor. The natural situation of brooks is, in many cases, destroyed for irrigation purposes and concrete channels often replace brooks. Further threats are water pollution and too intensive management (e.g. the clearing of all riparian vegetation). In recent years climate change has become one of the main threats and during recent hot and dry summers several brooks in Greece where found to be dry. Information on this for the sites where the species occurs is lacking, it is however likely that at least some of its populations were affected by the dry periods. Two known populations were visited in 2007: one population was found extinct and at the other site the habitat was degraded and only one male was found.

Hunting of this species is a particular problem on the island of Bioko (1).,A significant hindrance to the conservation of this species is that no <strong>montane forest</strong> in the Cameroon highlands is currently protected; this situation needs to urgently change as it is the most critical remaining habitat for PreussÃÂ¢??s guenon.

The dramatic decline in its distribution is attributable to over harvesting particularly during the 19th century as well as clearance for urban development agriculture and pine plantations (6).

Four Germans have recently been caught having captured 211 of these beetles (5). Other threats include habitat damage and loss infrastructure development (such as mobile telephone masts) inappropriate fire regimes human disturbance climate change and over-collection by researchers (4). These threats are exacerbated by the small range occupied by this genus and their suspected low reproductive rate (4).,All <i>Colophon</i> species were given provincial legal protection in 1992 which served to limit legal collection internal trade and export from the province (7) (3). Their listing on Appendix III of CITES also controls import and export of the species across South AfricaÃÂ¢??s borders (2). These laws appear to be fairly rigorously enforced with the four Germans recently caught with over 200 of these rare beetles fined almost ÃÂÃÂ£10000 (5). In 1994 it was proposed that <i>Colophon</i> beetles be upgraded to Appendix I of CITES but the proposal was ultimately withdrawn (7).

Since lungless salamanders need a damp environment to maintain the moist skin on which oxygen uptake depends (4) any alteration in moisture conditions poses a severe threat. Therefore although it still survives in shaded plantations and sugarcane fields any clearance of these to create more open drier habitats would have a negative impact on this species (1). Similarly climate change may also pose a threat and already appears to be causing dramatic declines in other Central American salamanders (12). Although there is not yet any direct evidence that the fungal disease chytridiomycosis has contributed to these declines its role in the decline of many other amphibian species suggests that it may also be a potential threat (12).,No specific conservation measures are currently known to be in place for SalvinÃÂ¢??s mushroomtongue salamander but the maintenance of shaded habitats has been identified as being important to its long-term survival (1).

This has been caused by introduced predatory fish primarily the smallmouth bass (<i>Micropterus dolomieu</i>) in addition to habitat degradation and fragmentation (2).  As the Olifants River region experiences hot dry summers water is extracted from the main river and its tributaries to irrigate the surrounding agricultural land.  Impoundments are also constructed to store water after the winter rainy season.  Furthermore river beds are bulldozed into wide channels to prevent the adjacent land from being flooded in the rainy season (2).  Such activities greatly alter the habitat of the sawfin and restrict its ability to move freely between different areas.,CapeNature a public institution responsible for biodiversity in the Western Cape (5) classifies the sawfin as endangered which makes it an offence to remove captured fish from rivers and dams.  CapeNature also undertakes regular surveys of the Olifants River system and has successfully cultured the sawfin since 1994.

Fetching thousands of dollars per butterfly this rare species has suffered severely from over harvesting (4). Recognising a dramatic decline in 1966 the Papua New Guinea government gave Queen AlexandraÃÂ¢??s birdwing legal protection from collectors. Consequently trade in this butterfly has been somewhat reduced but illegal collection continues to threaten this species. Today however the greatest threat to Queen AlexandraÃÂ¢??s birdwing is the loss of its lowland rainforest habitat. Historically forests were cleared for subsistence farming and logging and large tracts of forest were destroyed by the volcanic eruption of Mount Lamington in 1951. Presently the main cause behind forest loss is the expansion of the palm oil industry compounded by the development of rubber and cocoa plantations (7).ÃÂ ÃÂ ,Threatened by illegal trade and habitat loss the survival of Queen AlexandraÃÂ¢??s birdwing is dependant upon the successful implementation of conservation measures.

    The principal threat to its survival is habitat loss due to slash-and-burn agriculture, logging and mining. They are large bodied and diurnal, and therefore also among the most heavily hunted of all lemur species. The seasonality of their vocalizations (due to increased food availability) has been tied to increased levels of hunting (Ratsimbazafy 2002, Vasey 2003).

    The threats to this species are poorly documented but it is largely  reliant on bamboo. It is therefore susceptible to threats that remove  bamboo, such as land clearance for agriculture and selective extraction  of bamboo, particularly of the mid-sized stems this species prefers. Van Heygen (2004), however, reports that bamboo forest rapidly  establishes itself in cleared land, and suggests that as a result this  bamboo-dependent species may benefit from the clearance of primary  forest, in which suitable habitat is confined to fragmented bamboo  'islands'. The extent to which this is the case is presently unclear and requires further research (F. Glaw pers. comm. May 2011).

This extremely rare gecko has a highly fragmented distribution making it vulnerable to any detrimental activities within what little habitat remains (1). One small population is likely to be lost within the next 25 years as mining activity is planned in part of Sainte Luce while many other populations are under continual threat from local communities exploiting the forestÃÂ¢??s resources (1).

    The major threat is from overfishing; however, the species is protected in California (this legislation also covers U.S. fishers in Mexican waters) although incidental catches are allowed (see Conservation Measures below).

Indeed so dramatic were these declines that between 1932 and 1980 commercial landings diminished from 115 tonnes biomass to 5 tonnes in Californian waters and from 363 tonnes to 12 tonnes in Mexican waters. The speciesÃÂ¢?? limited distribution large size and aggregation in spawning areas made it an easy target for fisheries (1). Unfortunately its slow growth and late onset of sexual maturity make the fish extremely vulnerable to population collapses from over-fishing and slow to recover (5). Additionally it appears that the black sea bass may also be suffering from toxin poisoning. Sediments along the coast of California have been found to carry very high levels of toxins such as DDE and PCB with an area off the Palos Verdes peninsula thought to contain possibly the highest loads of DDE (a breakdown product of DDT) in the worldÃÂ¢??s oceans. The toxins cannot be broken down so as a mid-level predator black sea bass ingest the cumulative toxins in increased concentrations from the food chain below it and have been found to be carrying extremely high body burdens of DDE and PCB in southern California. The chemicals have been recorded to interfere with normal reproductive biology in other species of fish as well as amphibians reptiles and birds but more research is needed into the effects they are having on this giant fish and its process of recovery in California (3).,The black sea bass has been protected in California since 1981 and in Mexico since 1992. Both commercial and recreational fishing of this species were prohibited in California in 1981 although two fish per angler per trip are allowed to be caught south of the U.S.-Mexican border and one fish per trip to be taken incidentally by commercial fishermen. The law also limited the amount of black sea bass that could be caught in Mexican waters and landed in California (1). Although these laws have prevented commercial fishermen from targeting and profiting from these fish they have failed to protect the habitats occupied by the species from fishing and have probably done little to reduce incidental mortality since black sea bass entangled in nets have simply been discarded back into the sea (5). Indeed many fish in spawning aggregations in the summer have been caught and released frequently receiving injuries in the process (6). However the banning of gill nets in California in 1990 has probably helped significantly reduce the incidental mortality of this species and anecdotal data suggest that numbers may be beginning to rebound (1) (5). Nevertheless either voluntary or imposed seasonal and/or area closures would undoubtedly help further minimise incidental mortalities and greatly aid the recovery of this magnificent and dramatic giant of the sea (3) (6).,fishing;,protected;,1,1,yes,8379870,5800,1058,0,0.1824137931,4,0.0,0.5,0.7745966692,0.6,0.9,15.0,0.5,0.0,14.0,1.0,1,1,1.0,0,1.0,13,13,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0,1.0,17,17,0,1,1,1,1,1,yes,0,1

This has been caused by introduced predatory fish primarily the smallmouth bass (<i>Micropterus dolomieu</i>) in addition to habitat degradation and fragmentation (2).  As the Olifants River region experiences hot dry summers water is extracted from the main river and its tributaries to irrigate the surrounding agricultural land.  Impoundments are also constructed to store water after the winter rainy season.  Furthermore river beds are bulldozed into wide channels to prevent the adjacent land from being flooded in the rainy season (2).  Such activities greatly alter the habitat of the sawfin and restrict its ability to move freely between different areas.,CapeNature a public institution responsible for biodiversity in the Western Cape (5) classifies the sawfin as endangered which makes it an offence to remove captured fish from rivers and dams.

The majority of the land in the Karoo Desert is very unfertile but the riverine rabbit occupies the flood plains of the seasonal Karoo rivers and its tributaries which are fertile and have therefore been ploughed extensively in some areas. Removal of the natural vegetation along the rivers and streams prevents the rabbit from constructing stable breeding burrows due to the loss of the soft <strong>alluvial</strong> top soils and from feeding and escaping predation (1). Overgrazing by domestic herbivores also poses a threat to the rabbitsÃÂ¢?? habitat and results in habitat degradation and fragmentation (2). As rabbits and hares are adding to the menu of farm workers they are shot or trapped with gin traps (1).,The Endangered Wildlife TrustÃÂ¢??s Riverine Rabbit Working Group (EWT-RRWG) was established in August 2003 with the aim of establishing and conserving an ecosystem and socioeconomic conditions in the Karoo that can support a stable population of riverine rabbits. The EWT-RRWG achieves this through surveys research and monitoring environmental education and awareness habitat management and rehabilitation and conservation stewardship programmes. At present none of the riverine rabbit habitat is protected and the species only occurs on private Karoo farmland. Therefore the establishment of Riverine Rabbit Conservancies is an important aim for the EWT-RRWG. Conservancies are areas established by a voluntary agreement with private landowners who have riverine rabbits and potentially suitable habitat on their properties. So far three have been established in the Karoo. The conservation and management of riverine rabbit populations and their habitat is outlined in the conservancy constitution and landowners strictly control or prohibit any hunting with dogs and the use of gin traps (7).

A highly secretive species spending a long period of time (6 to 7 months) below ground in burrows the Chinese alligator now primarily exists in populated areas where it inevitably comes into conflict with local farmers. Burrow systems cause drainage problems for fields and alligators also consume ducks owned by farmers (2).

The seeds and the vitamin C-rich fruit pulp are eaten fresh and cooking oil is extracted from the oil-rich seeds.  The fruit is either collected from the ground or wooden pegs are hammered into the trunk so the tree can be climbed to collect the fruit (2).  The thick bark of the baobab is composed of tough long fibres that can be used to make ropes and the majority of trees bear scars from where the bark was cut from ground level to about two meters to obtain this material (2).  The spongy wood is comprised of sheets of fibre that are collected from dead or living trees dried in the sun and sold for thatch (2).  Most of these varied uses do not involve the tree being killed and thus are unlikely to pose a great threat to the baobab.  The greatest threat to this species has come from the transformation of its forest habitat into agricultural land.  Within these disturbed habitats there is a noticeable lack of young trees.  Fires seed predation competition from weeds and an altered physical environment might be affecting the ability of the Madagacar baobab to reproduce (2) which may have devastating consequences for its survival.,Numerous non-governmental organisations and scientists along with the Malagasy government realise the importance of conserving the unique biodiversity of Madagascar and are working to protect this magnificent island and its diverse fauna and flora (4).  One measure from which GrandidierÃÂ¢??s baobab is likely to benefit is the designation of protected areas.

    The most critical threat to this species is probably chytridiomycosis. However, the type locality lies within an unprotected forested area that has been altered at a fast rate, mainly due to subsistence wood collection, and conversion to crop lands and pasture lands. With higher insolation as a result of climate change, this species could be at increased risk due to its habit of basking in the sun.

Therefore although it still survives in shaded plantations and sugarcane fields any clearance of these to create more open drier habitats would have a negative impact on this species (1). Similarly climate change may also pose a threat and already appears to be causing dramatic declines in other Central American salamanders (12).

The biodiversity of Indonesia is significantly threatened by widespread habitat destruction caused by illegal and commercial logging and large agricultural projects such as rubber and oil palm plantations (7).  <i>Nepenthes burbidgeae</i> has a highly localised distribution making this species particularly susceptible to extinction throught habitat destruction or catastrophic environmental events such as drought or fire.

However trade is very difficult to regulate as there is no requirement for internationally traded <i>Nepenthes</i> to be identified down to species level and plants simply labelled as <i>Nepenthes </i>accounted for 94 percent of all exported <i>Nepenthes </i>plants between 1988 and 1993.

In addition this cycad is used in numerous ways by the local human population and some of this exploitation is having a negative impact on cycad numbers. <i>Cycas circinalis</i> is heavily harvested for its leaves with young leaves being used as food and medicine by indigenous and local communities and the mature leaves being sold in the floriculture industry (7). The biggest impact on <i>C. circinalis </i>populations however comes from the harvest of pith and male cone for the medicinal plant industry. While much of this harvest is illegal it is very difficult to patrol (7). It is not only the cycad itself that this harvesting may threaten; the harvesting of its seeds for human consumption appears to have little negative impact on <i>Cycas circinalis</i> populations but very heavy seed harvest could have an impact on the bats which reportedly feed on the seeds (7).,Significant populations of <i>Cycas circinalis</i> still exist in a number of national parks and forest reserves (2) which offers this species some protection. To reduce harvesting pressure on populations it has been suggested that people need to be encouraged to use substitutes. For example the floriculture industry could use leaves from cultivated palms that are faster growing. A substitute for the pith and male cone for the medicinal plant industry is not likely and thus in these cases populations need to be increased through cultivation (7).,,,0,0,yes,2041034,6879,257,0,0.03736008141,3,0.25,,,,,,,,,1.0,1,1,1.0,0,1.0,10,10,0.2068965517,0.5,0.3333333333,0.7816666667000001,9,0.4375,6,6,0,1,1,1,1,1,yes,1,0

The main threat to this species is thought to be habitat loss which is occurring due to excessive groundwater pumping for agriculture (1). The Comanche Spring pupfish has become locally extinct in the spring where it was discovered due to groundwater extraction (1) and excessive water removal is still a problem in the area as much more water being removed than being replaced by rainfall (3). Other threats to this species include competition and <strong>hybridisation</strong> with non-native species such as the sheepshead minnow (<em>Cyprinodon variegatus</em>) (14). An especially large population of this <strong>invasive</strong> fish lives in Lake Balmorhea and the upstream dispersal of this population is proving to be detrimental to the Comanche Springs pupfish (15).,Current conservation efforts for this species are focussed on moderating water level fluctuations and removing <strong>invasive</strong> species (1). A man-made refugium and cienega were constructed in Balmorhea State Park in 1996 in an attempt to provide the Comanche Springs pupfish with a habitat that is not at risk of being drained (15). This wetland area has been located within the boundaries of the natural cienega in an effort to make it resemble and function similarly to the original habitat of this species (16). This conservation measure has proved to be a success and the area is now home to the worldÃÂ¢??s largest Comanche Springs pupfish population. Additionally it is hoped that the removal of the <strong>invasive</strong> sheepshead minnow will help the Comanche Springs pupfish population to recover by eliminating unnatural competition (17).,loss;environment;invasive;pet;,,4,0,yes,1777540,4580,224,0,0.04890829694,4,0.0,0.12962962960000002,0.0,0.0,0.6461282051,30.0,0.2307692308,-5.0,8.0,1.0,1,1,1.0,0,1.0,15,15,0.3870967742,0.5,0.3333333333,0.8961904762,8,0.6190476189999999,10,12,0,1,1,1,1,1,yes,1,0

    The major threats to RicordÃÂ¢??s iguanas are from human activities resulting in habitat reduction and degradation (clearing of vegetation for agricultural use, charcoal production, harvesting of fuelwood and hardwoods, overbrowsing by free-ranging livestock, mining of limestone, illegal collection of live cacti for local and international trade), in combination with local subsistence hunting for food and predation from introduced carnivores (dogs, cats and mongooses).  Competition from mammalian herbivores probably also occurs.  Hunting of RicordÃÂ¢??s iguanas for food and trade has increased gradually since the mid 1970s, both for local consumption as well as at a few oriental restaurants in Santo Domingo where iguanas were offered as a speciality dish.  In the past, some hunters used to set up to 100 snare traps per day at the entrance of retreats, with 30-50% trapping success.  Although current populations no longer support the numbers harvested 15 years ago, iguanas continue to be captured opportunistically in all areas with remaining populations, except on Isla Cabritos where law enforcement is presently effective.

Consequently trade in this butterfly has been somewhat reduced but illegal collection continues to threaten this species. Today however the greatest threat to Queen AlexandraÃÂ¢??s birdwing is the loss of its lowland rainforest habitat. Historically forests were cleared for subsistence farming and logging and large tracts of forest were destroyed by the volcanic eruption of Mount Lamington in 1951.

A Darwin Initiative Project has undertaken conservation work in the British Virgin Islands and recommendations for preserving the islandsÃÂ¢?? plant species include seed collection monitoring programmes and introducing plants into cultivation. It will also be important to raise public awareness about the value of the regionÃÂ¢??s unique flora and its conservation (6).,loss;,protected;,1,1,yes,10200588,6068,1288,0,0.2122610415,3,0.25,,,,,,,,,1.0,1,1,1.0,0,1.0,9,9,0.3684210526,0.5,0.3333333333,0.9014279176,9,0.64,14,15,0,1,1,1,1,1,yes,1,0

This has been caused by introduced predatory fish primarily the smallmouth bass (<i>Micropterus dolomieu</i>) in addition to habitat degradation and fragmentation (2).  As the Olifants River region experiences hot dry summers water is extracted from the main river and its tributaries to irrigate the surrounding agricultural land.  Impoundments are also constructed to store water after the winter rainy season.  Furthermore river beds are bulldozed into wide channels to prevent the adjacent land from being flooded in the rainy season (2).  Such activities greatly alter the habitat of the sawfin and restrict its ability to move freely between different areas.,CapeNature a public institution responsible for biodiversity in the Western Cape (5) classifies the sawfin as endangered which makes it an offence to remove captured fish from rivers and dams.  CapeNature also undertakes regular surveys of the Olifants River system and has successfully cultured the sawfin since 1994.  Juveniles are then introduced to suitable natural habitats or stocked into farm dams to establish refuge populations.  Small parts of the sawfinÃÂ¢??s range fall within protected areas including the Cedarberg Matjies River and Oorlogskloof Nature Reserves (2).  However to ensure the sawfinÃÂ¢??s future it is vital to protect the habitat in the specific tributaries and the small section of the Olifants River mainstream where the sawfin remains abundant.  In addition efforts to prevent further introductions of alien predatory fish species are imperative (2).,fragmentation;,protected;,1,1,yes,6253714,864,790,0,0.9143518519,3,0.0,,,,,,,,,1.0,1,1,1.0,0,1.0,10,10,0.28,0.5,0.3333333333,0.8402777778,8,0.5,4,8,0,1,1,1,1,1,yes,1,0
