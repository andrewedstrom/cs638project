Since lungless salamanders need a damp environment to maintain the moist skin on which oxygen uptake depends (4) any alteration in moisture conditions poses a severe threat. Therefore although it still survives in shaded plantations and sugarcane fields any clearance of these to create more open drier habitats would have a negative impact on this species (1). Similarly climate change may also pose a threat and already appears to be causing dramatic declines in other Central American salamanders (12). Although there is not yet any direct evidence that the fungal disease chytridiomycosis has contributed to these declines its role in the decline of many other amphibian species suggests that it may also be a potential threat (12).,No specific conservation measures are currently known to be in place for SalvinÃÂ¢??s mushroomtongue salamander but the maintenance of shaded habitats has been identified as being important to its long-term survival (1).

    The major threats to RicordÃÂ¢??s iguanas are from human activities resulting in habitat reduction and degradation (clearing of vegetation for agricultural use, charcoal production, harvesting of fuelwood and hardwoods, overbrowsing by free-ranging livestock, mining of limestone, illegal collection of live cacti for local and international trade), in combination with local subsistence hunting for food and predation from introduced carnivores (dogs, cats and mongooses).  Competition from mammalian herbivores probably also occurs.  Hunting of RicordÃÂ¢??s iguanas for food and trade has increased gradually since the mid 1970s, both for local consumption as well as at a few oriental restaurants in Santo Domingo where iguanas were offered as a speciality dish.  In the past, some hunters used to set up to 100 snare traps per day at the entrance of retreats, with 30-50% trapping success.  Although current populations no longer support the numbers harvested 15 years ago, iguanas continue to be captured opportunistically in all areas with remaining populations, except on Isla Cabritos where law enforcement is presently effective.





    


  ","['\n    Aside from occasional smuggling of animals across the Haitian border, compliance with international CITES trade regulations is effective.  Enforcement of national protective legislation in the Dominican Republic has improved during the past few years, but effective control is adversely influenced by a number of factors.

In the Neiba Valley, about 60% of the area supporting iguanas, including Isla Cabritos and a section of the south shore of Lake Enriquillo, is protected within the recently created Lago Enriquillo National Park.  The Isla Cabritos population has been protected within Isla Cabritos National Park since 1974.

RicordÃÂ¢??s iguanas are only known from the parkÃÂ¢??s western boundary, where conflicts with limestone mining concessions on both sides of the park border continue to be unresolved.  Until now, no formal management has been established in the Acetillar reserve, and the habitat is impacted by a variety of activities.

Successful captive breeding has been achieved in both, but survivorship of young has been low.  The only other significant captive breeding program was developed at the Parque Zoologico Nacional (ZooDom).  Although adversely affected by institutional problems, the program lasted for a number of years with comparable success.

The San Salvador iguana now has a relatively remote distribution away from most human settlements but a large and varied range of threats nevertheless continue to make their prospects of long-term survival tenuous (4) (8).,Since a number of surrounding cays as well as the mainland of San Salvador have very similar habitat to that currently used by the species reintroductions to parts of the iguanaÃÂ¢??s former range are a viable and important focus of conservation efforts (4). An introduced population of AcklinÃÂ¢??s iguanas (<i>C. r. nuchalis</i>) currently thrives on an island within the Exumas Land and Sea Park (6) and a successful translocation of five adult pairs of <i>C. r. rileyi</i> from Green Cay to Cut Cay took place in February 2005 funded by a 2004 grant from the International Iguana Foundation (7). Candidate cays for further reintroductions (and source of animals) include Barn Cay (from Guana Cay) Cato Cay (from Green Cay) and High Cay (from Low Cay). Corrective actions may first be required to render each cay suitable for reintroduction (e.g. removal of feral rats) and reintroduction of iguanas on the mainland should be undertaken only if large areas are protected particularly from the feral dogs and cats that are already numerous in local areas (4).,poaching;disease;,protected;,2,1,yes,6213005,7645,784,0,0.1025506867,2,0.5,0.09803921569,0.2581988897,0.14285714289999998,0.557505071,44.0,0.2413793103,-24.0,9.0,1.0,1,1,1.0,0,1.0,9,9,0.4782608696,0.5,0.3333333333,0.8946428570999999,5,0.6875,9,10,0,1,1,1,1,1,yes,1,0

Although the Evrotas River naturally dries up during periods of drought water extraction for agriculture has exacerbated this resulting in fish being stranded in stagnant pools of water with low oxygen concentration and high temperatures (1) (6). This was most severe in 2007 when a prolonged drought resulted in around 80 percent of the main river course drying up (6). As the European dace inhabits fast flowing cold waters mass fish mortality has been observed in areas where its habitat has been degraded in such a way (5). Fish communities within the Evrotas River have also suffered from pollution with lowland parts of the river often near urban areas being the most severely effected (1) (6).,The Evrotas River home to the European dace is a unique biodiversity hotspot within Greece. Its waters support many <strong>endemic</strong> species of plants and fish and consequently protecting this fragile environment is a key conservation priority (6).

    The major threats to RicordÃÂ¢??s iguanas are from human activities resulting in habitat reduction and degradation (clearing of vegetation for agricultural use, charcoal production, harvesting of fuelwood and hardwoods, overbrowsing by free-ranging livestock, mining of limestone, illegal collection of live cacti for local and international trade), in combination with local subsistence hunting for food and predation from introduced carnivores (dogs, cats and mongooses).  Competition from mammalian herbivores probably also occurs.  Hunting of RicordÃÂ¢??s iguanas for food and trade has increased gradually since the mid 1970s, both for local consumption as well as at a few oriental restaurants in Santo Domingo where iguanas were offered as a speciality dish.  In the past, some hunters used to set up to 100 snare traps per day at the entrance of retreats, with 30-50% trapping success.  Although current populations no longer support the numbers harvested 15 years ago, iguanas continue to be captured opportunistically in all areas with remaining populations, except on Isla Cabritos where law enforcement is presently effective.





    


  ","['\n    Aside from occasional smuggling of animals across the Haitian border, compliance with international CITES trade regulations is effective.  Enforcement of national protective legislation in the Dominican Republic has improved during the past few years, but effective control is adversely influenced by a number of factors.  Clearing of natural habitat for development is not being prevented nor regulated and illegal hunting for food and the local pet market continues.  ', <br/>, ' ', <br/>, 'RicordÃÂ¢??s iguana is partially protected in two areas.  In the Neiba Valley, about 60% of the area supporting iguanas, including Isla Cabritos and a section of the south shore of Lake Enriquillo, is protected within the recently created Lago Enriquillo National Park.  The Isla Cabritos population has been protected within Isla Cabritos National Park since 1974.  ', <br/>, ' ', <br/>, 'In the Barahona Peninsula range, two protected areas, Parque Nacional Jaragua and the Acetillar Scenic Reserve, cover most of the remaining distribution of the species to the north and east of Cabo Rojo.  RicordÃÂ¢??s iguanas are only known from the parkÃÂ¢??s western boundary, where conflicts with limestone mining concessions on both sides of the park border continue to be unresolved.  Until now, no formal management has been established in the Acetillar reserve, and the habitat is impacted by a variety of activities.    ', <br/>, ' ', <br/>, 'As of November 1995 the total captive population of RicordÃÂ¢??s iguana was 5.9 individuals in two collections (Indianapolis Zoo and one private collection).  Successful captive breeding has been achieved in both, but survivorship of young has been low.  The only other significant captive breeding program was developed at the Parque Zoologico Nacional (ZooDom).  Although adversely affected by institutional problems, the program lasted for a number of years with comparable success.  Plans to re-establish the program at ZooDom have been halted since 1994 due to unfavorable institutional conditions\n\n    \n  ']",Decreasing,Critically Endangered,2,Cyclura ricordii,yes,1007,Cyclura pinguis,anegada ground iguana,Animalia,Chordata,Reptilia,Squamata,Iguanidae,Cyclura,Male snout-to-vent length: to 560 mmFemale snout-to-vent length: to 500 mmMale weight: 7.75 kgFemale weight: 5.25 kg (2),Anegada ground iguana populations have undergone a drastic decline in recent decades leaving possibly fewer than 200 total individuals teetering on the brink of extinction (5). The drop in numbers is probably attributable to a range of threats including habitat loss and poaching by hunters who are trafficking exotic animals (2). Most devastating however has been the introduction of alien species (5). Feral dogs first reported in 1994 are known to kill adult iguanas and predation by an exploding population of feral cats on juveniles is responsible for the deaths of many hatchlings each year (2) (5). The primary threat however comes from competition for food from feral livestock with the island teeming with sheep goats donkeys and cattle that have been released to roam freely across Anegada (2) (4). Grazing pressure from these livestock has radically changed the composition of vegetation available to the iguana shifting the speciesÃÂ¢?? diet to rely more on plants with secondary compounds with dubious nutritional value (2).,The Anegada Iguana Recovery Programme began in 1997 which included establishing a ÃÂ¢??headstartÃÂ¢?? facility. This facility collects hatchlings and nurtures them in captivity until they can be safely released into the wild with the aim of combating the high rates of juvenile mortality due to cat predation by raising them until they are large enough that predation will not pose as great a threat (6). The first 24 were released into the wild in October 2003 with an 84 percent survival rate and a second group of 24 were released in October 2004 and these are currently being tracked (5). In the 1980s small numbers of these iguanas were removed from Anegada and restored to parts of their former range on Guana Island where the species appears to be doing well in the absence of introduced predators (1) (2). The Guana Island Wildlife Sanctuary continues to try to rid the island of sheep the only feral grazing competitor on the island which may improve the habitat there for the iguanas (1). The species was also later introduced to Necker Island (2). A national park designed to protect this Critically Endangered iguana on Anegada has been approved in principle by the Anegada Lands Committee but rampant debates over land ownership and property boundaries impede developments and must be resolved before this project can progress (2) (4). Further conservation actions advocated include a cat eradication programme and the construction of fences around protected areas to keep livestock out. Indeed despite the successes of the headstart programme it is imperative that efforts are made to control livestock and to secure protected land for the survival of this species. Without prompt action it has been suggested that these iguanas may become extinct on Anegada within the next decade (2).,loss;poaching;pet;,protected;,3,1,yes,7978050,7645,1007,0,0.1317200785,4,0.0,0.2608695652,0.5163977795,0.3333333333,0.6013061651,42.0,0.275862069,-20.0,15.0,1.0,1,1,1.0,0,1.0,9,9,0.2962962963,0.5,0.3333333333,0.8583333333,6,0.625,9,9,0,1,1,1,1,1,yes,1,0

Habitat is burned to provide pasture for livestock and cut for charcoal production.

Habitat degradation and conversion to developments for tourism human settlements and road construction are particularly severe problems while predation from introduced mammals such as rats and mongoose also threatens many native species (6). As a result of these threats the range of the Virgin Islands coqui has become highly fragmented and there is an ongoing decline in the quality of its habitat. The small distinct population on Great Dog is particularly vulnerable. The Virgin Islands coqui also appears to be declining with the spread of the predatory Cuban tree frog (<em>Osteopilus septentrionalis</em>) (1).<em>ÃÂ  </em>,A number of conservation recommendations have been made to protect the native fauna of the British Virgin Islands including the creation of protected areas and minimising the impacts of development through the better enforcement of protective legislation. Increased monitoring efforts for amphibian populations may also be required given the potential for deadly diseases such as the fungus chytridiomycosis to break out on the island especially as disease has been associated with dramatic amphibian declines on nearby islands (6).

With such a tiny population events such as cyclones can also have catastrophic effects on this palm (8). Although the palmiste marron is being increasingly cultivated on Rodrigues to be planted as part of a habitat restoration project there is a threat of <strong>hybridisation</strong> with <em>Hyophorbe lagenicaulis</em> which has been introduced from Round Island (1) (7) (8).,Conservation measures recommended for the palmiste marron and other <strong>endemic</strong> palms of the Mascarene Islands include fencing and weeding of areas of native forest to protect the remaining wild palms as well as propagating species and re-introducing them into the wild and undertaking further biological research (7) (8). It will also be important to involve local communities with education programmes incentives from tourism and palm plantations and stricter laws for cutting down palms (7). The palmiste marron needs to be protected from <strong>hybridisation</strong> with closely-related palm species and legislation is needed to ban the introduction of non-native palms to Rodrigues. Palms that have already been introduced will also need to be removed although this has proved difficult to date because most are being grown in private gardens (7).

Although unproven it is thought that the introduction of the northern Pacific seastar (<i>Asterias amurensis</i>) to Tasmania at this time may be the key to the decimation of the handfish population (3). These seastars are voracious predators of shellfish and it is thought that they may also eat the eggs of handfish or the sea squirts upon which the eggs are attached (2). The deterioration of coastal habitats due to development may also be involved in the decline (3). This species is under added threat from its vastly reduced population limited dispersal restricted distribution and low reproductive rate (3).,Just two spotted handfish were reported between 1990 and 1994; this dire state of the population led to the formation of the Spotted Handfish Recovery Team in 1996 (3). The Recovery Team consists of a number of government agencies concerned with saving this rare and bizarre fish. Research into existing wild populations and the development of captive breeding techniques are some of the priorities of the recovery plan (3).

The main threat to this species is thought to be habitat loss which is occurring due to excessive groundwater pumping for agriculture (1). The Comanche Spring pupfish has become locally extinct in the spring where it was discovered due to groundwater extraction (1) and excessive water removal is still a problem in the area as much more water being removed than being replaced by rainfall (3). Other threats to this species include competition and <strong>hybridisation</strong> with non-native species such as the sheepshead minnow (<em>Cyprinodon variegatus</em>) (14). An especially large population of this <strong>invasive</strong> fish lives in Lake Balmorhea and the upstream dispersal of this population is proving to be detrimental to the Comanche Springs pupfish (15).,Current conservation efforts for this species are focussed on moderating water level fluctuations and removing <strong>invasive</strong> species (1). A man-made refugium and cienega were constructed in Balmorhea State Park in 1996 in an attempt to provide the Comanche Springs pupfish with a habitat that is not at risk of being drained (15). This wetland area has been located within the boundaries of the natural cienega in an effort to make it resemble and function similarly to the original habitat of this species (16). This conservation measure has proved to be a success and the area is now home to the worldÃÂ¢??s largest Comanche Springs pupfish population.

The main threat to this species is thought to be habitat loss which is occurring due to excessive groundwater pumping for agriculture (1). The Comanche Spring pupfish has become locally extinct in the spring where it was discovered due to groundwater extraction (1) and excessive water removal is still a problem in the area as much more water being removed than being replaced by rainfall (3). Other threats to this species include competition and <strong>hybridisation</strong> with non-native species such as the sheepshead minnow (<em>Cyprinodon variegatus</em>) (14). An especially large population of this <strong>invasive</strong> fish lives in Lake Balmorhea and the upstream dispersal of this population is proving to be detrimental to the Comanche Springs pupfish (15).,Current conservation efforts for this species are focussed on moderating water level fluctuations and removing <strong>invasive</strong> species (1). A man-made refugium and cienega were constructed in Balmorhea State Park in 1996 in an attempt to provide the Comanche Springs pupfish with a habitat that is not at risk of being drained (15). This wetland area has been located within the boundaries of the natural cienega in an effort to make it resemble and function similarly to the original habitat of this species (16). This conservation measure has proved to be a success and the area is now home to the worldÃÂ¢??s largest Comanche Springs pupfish population.

    The desiccation and pollution of the canal system and lakes in Xochimilco and Chalco, as a result of urbanization, as well as the traditional consumption of the species by local people, is threatening the survival of this species. Increased tourist activity is poorly regulated and adds further pollution (Zambrano, 2006). The species is also captured for medicinal purposes. The harvesting is targeted at animals that are less than one year old. It was formerly also captured for the international pet trade, although probably all animals in the international trade are now of captive origin. Introduced fishes (tilapia and carp) have increased to high abundances (a recent study collected 600kg of tilapia in one small channel using a 100m net) and have also impacted axolotls through competition and predation. The animals are also being affected by disease, probably spread by invasive species, and as a result of poor water quality. Although the water regime has changed in the last 10 years, and it is reported that pollution levels are decreasing, factors such as very high levels of bacterial contamination could still pose a serious threat.

    There are two main threats: illicit hunting and hybridization with native American Crocodiles. Hunting increased substantially from the 1990s to the present and is principally for the sale of meat to private restaurants serving the tourist industry or for local consumption. Hybridization has long been suspected but poorly understood. Recent genetic studies provide preliminary evidence that extensive hybridization is taking place in the wild.

Locals in this area are also in contact with the infamous esturine or 'saltwater' crocodile (<i>Crocodylus porosus</i>) which is one of the largest reptiles in the world and has a reputation as a man-eater.

It is not only the cycad itself that this harvesting may threaten; the harvesting of its seeds for human consumption appears to have little negative impact on <i>Cycas circinalis</i> populations but very heavy seed harvest could have an impact on the bats which reportedly feed on the seeds (7).,Significant populations of <i>Cycas circinalis</i> still exist in a number of national parks and forest reserves (2) which offers this species some protection.

    This species is threatened mainly by hunting and commercial logging (Whittaker 2006), as well as conversion to oil palm plantations, forest clearing, and product extraction by local people (Whittaker 2006). Recently, hunting pressure has intensified because of increased access to remote areas due to logging roads and tracks, as well as the replacement of bows and arrows with .177 caliber air rifles, anything larger is illegal in Indonesia (Whittaker 2006). Also, local rituals and taboos that formerly regulated hunting have been replaced by Christianity (Whittaker 2006).

A decrease in water quality was probably the most significant agent as the loss of the species from the Cahaba River coincided with an increase in nitrogen and phosphorous caused by sewage discharge. This led to higher algal biomass and decreased levels of dissolved oxygen in the water (4) (5).

Fetching thousands of dollars per butterfly this rare species has suffered severely from over harvesting (4). Recognising a dramatic decline in 1966 the Papua New Guinea government gave Queen AlexandraÃÂ¢??s birdwing legal protection from collectors. Consequently trade in this butterfly has been somewhat reduced but illegal collection continues to threaten this species. Today however the greatest threat to Queen AlexandraÃÂ¢??s birdwing is the loss of its lowland rainforest habitat. Historically forests were cleared for subsistence farming and logging and large tracts of forest were destroyed by the volcanic eruption of Mount Lamington in 1951. Presently the main cause behind forest loss is the expansion of the palm oil industry compounded by the development of rubber and cocoa plantations (7).ÃÂ ÃÂ ,Threatened by illegal trade and habitat loss the survival of Queen AlexandraÃÂ¢??s birdwing is dependant upon the successful implementation of conservation measures.

Their slow growth rate and late onset of sexual maturity make these fish extremely vulnerable to the effects of over-fishing (5). Not only does this mean that individuals are often harvested many years before reaching maturity and therefore unable to increase abundance through reproduction but also that populations will be slow to recover from collapses in numbers (7). Since population numbers are now too low to sustain target fisheries Atlantic halibut are predominantly taken as <strong>bycatch</strong> by bottom trawlers and longliners (8). Surveys indicate that these fish have continued to decline in the North Atlantic over the past two decades despite being taken only incidentally as <strong>bycatch</strong> with little targeted halibut fishing (7).,There is currently no management plan in place for this fish and it is therefore thought probable that numbers of Atlantic halibut will continue to decline. It has been argued that Atlantic halibut are unlikely to recover simply by banning halibut landings or designating protected areas. Rather the recovery and survival of this Endangered flatfish species will depend on reducing its <strong>bycatch</strong> in other highly exploited fisheries (7).,fishing;,protected;,1,1,yes,427413,3,54,0,0.05555555556,2,0.0,0.6666666667,0.8164965809,0.6666666667,0.936,8.0,0.68,9.0,16.0,1.0,1,1,1.0,0,1.0,14,14,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0,1.0,25,25,0,1,1,1,1,1,yes,0,1

    The major threat is from overfishing; however, the species is protected in California (this legislation also covers U.S. fishers in Mexican waters) although incidental catches are allowed (see Conservation Measures below).





    


  ","['\n    The fish has been protected in California since 1982 and protected in Mexico since 1992 (Crooke 1992). ', <br/>, ' ', <br/>, 'California State Legislature banned both commercial and recreational fishing for Giant Sea Bass in 1981 in response to the great decline in population, but it allowed two fish per angler per trip when fishing south of United States-Mexico border (Crooke 1992) and allowed one fish per trip if taken incidentally in gill or trammel net by commercial fisherman (Domeier 2001). ', <br/>, ' ', <br/>, 'The species can still be caught in Mexico (M. Domeier, pers. comm.). ', <br/>, ' ', <br/>, 'The law limited the amount of Giant Sea Bass that could be taken in Mexican waters and landed in California (could not land more than 3,000 lbs in a calendar year). The ban of inshore gill nets in California was introduced in 1990, which was considered a way to significantly reduce the incidental mortality of Giant Sea Bass (Domeier 2001).\n\n    \n  ']",Unknown,Critically Endangered,3,Stereolepis gigas,yes,1059,Stereolepis gigas,black sea bass,Animalia,Chordata,Actinopterygii,Perciformes,Polyprionidae,Stereolepis,up to 255.6 kg (2),The black sea bass has been massively over-fished in both California and Mexican waters leaving this water giant Critically Endangered. Indeed so dramatic were these declines that between 1932 and 1980 commercial landings diminished from 115 tonnes biomass to 5 tonnes in Californian waters and from 363 tonnes to 12 tonnes in Mexican waters. The speciesÃÂ¢?? limited distribution large size and aggregation in spawning areas made it an easy target for fisheries (1). Unfortunately its slow growth and late onset of sexual maturity make the fish extremely vulnerable to population collapses from over-fishing and slow to recover (5). Additionally it appears that the black sea bass may also be suffering from toxin poisoning. Sediments along the coast of California have been found to carry very high levels of toxins such as DDE and PCB with an area off the Palos Verdes peninsula thought to contain possibly the highest loads of DDE (a breakdown product of DDT) in the worldÃÂ¢??s oceans. The toxins cannot be broken down so as a mid-level predator black sea bass ingest the cumulative toxins in increased concentrations from the food chain below it and have been found to be carrying extremely high body burdens of DDE and PCB in southern California. The chemicals have been recorded to interfere with normal reproductive biology in other species of fish as well as amphibians reptiles and birds but more research is needed into the effects they are having on this giant fish and its process of recovery in California (3).,The black sea bass has been protected in California since 1981 and in Mexico since 1992. Both commercial and recreational fishing of this species were prohibited in California in 1981 although two fish per angler per trip are allowed to be caught south of the U.S.-Mexican border and one fish per trip to be taken incidentally by commercial fishermen. The law also limited the amount of black sea bass that could be caught in Mexican waters and landed in California (1). Although these laws have prevented commercial fishermen from targeting and profiting from these fish they have failed to protect the habitats occupied by the species from fishing and have probably done little to reduce incidental mortality since black sea bass entangled in nets have simply been discarded back into the sea (5). Indeed many fish in spawning aggregations in the summer have been caught and released frequently receiving injuries in the process (6). However the banning of gill nets in California in 1990 has probably helped significantly reduce the incidental mortality of this species and anecdotal data suggest that numbers may be beginning to rebound (1) (5). Nevertheless either voluntary or imposed seasonal and/or area closures would undoubtedly help further minimise incidental mortalities and greatly aid the recovery of this magnificent and dramatic giant of the sea (3) (6).,fishing;,protected;,1,1,yes,8387785,5800,1059,0,0.1825862069,4,0.0,0.5,0.7745966692,0.6,0.9,15.0,0.5,0.0,14.0,1.0,1,1,1.0,0,1.0,13,13,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0,1.0,17,17,0,1,1,1,1,1,yes,0,1

This has been caused by introduced predatory fish primarily the smallmouth bass (<i>Micropterus dolomieu</i>) in addition to habitat degradation and fragmentation (2).  As the Olifants River region experiences hot dry summers water is extracted from the main river and its tributaries to irrigate the surrounding agricultural land.  Impoundments are also constructed to store water after the winter rainy season.  Furthermore river beds are bulldozed into wide channels to prevent the adjacent land from being flooded in the rainy season (2).  Such activities greatly alter the habitat of the sawfin and restrict its ability to move freely between different areas.,CapeNature a public institution responsible for biodiversity in the Western Cape (5) classifies the sawfin as endangered which makes it an offence to remove captured fish from rivers and dams.

Habitat degradation and conversion to developments for tourism human settlements and road construction are particularly severe problems while predation from introduced mammals such as rats and mongoose also threatens many native species (6). As a result of these threats the range of the Virgin Islands coqui has become highly fragmented and there is an ongoing decline in the quality of its habitat. The small distinct population on Great Dog is particularly vulnerable. The Virgin Islands coqui also appears to be declining with the spread of the predatory Cuban tree frog (<em>Osteopilus septentrionalis</em>) (1).<em>ÃÂ  </em>,A number of conservation recommendations have been made to protect the native fauna of the British Virgin Islands including the creation of protected areas and minimising the impacts of development through the better enforcement of protective legislation. Increased monitoring efforts for amphibian populations may also be required given the potential for deadly diseases such as the fungus chytridiomycosis to break out on the island especially as disease has been associated with dramatic amphibian declines on nearby islands (6). Additional study and protection of the Virgin Islands coqui population on Great Dog is a conservation priority for the species while there is also a need to afford its habitat on Tortola and Virgin Gorda increased protection and control invasive predators (1) (6).,,protected;,0,1,yes,7278083,4198,919,0,0.2189137685,2,0.5,,,,,,,,,0.4074074074,0,0,0.7092667565999999,6,0.6842105262999999,9,11,0.4615384615,0.5,0.3333333333,0.9028083028,9,0.6666666667,17,18,0,1,1,1,1,1,yes,1,0

Black and brown rats (<i>Rattus rattus</i> and <i>Rattus norvegicus</i>) were accidentally brought to the West Indies on foreign ships from Europe wreaking havoc on <strong>endemic</strong> wildlife including the Antiguan racer whose eggs and young were preyed upon (4). Then in the late 19th Century the small Indian mongoose (<i>Herpestes javanicus</i>) was introduced in an effort to control rat populations in sugar cane plantations. These quickly established themselves and systematically drove many species of terrestrial reptiles and ground-nesting birds to extinction or near-extinction amongst them the Antiguan racer (5). To make matters worse many Antiguans and visiting tourists wrongly believed the racer to be dangerous and snakes were often killed on sight (3).,In 1989 the believed extinct Antiguan racer was rediscovered on Great Bird Island where it was indeed facing imminent extinction. By 1995 only about 60 racers survived and most had been severely injured by rats (3). A conservation initiative sprang into action to save this species; Fauna and Flora International the Antigua Forestry Unit the Island Resources Foundation the Durrell Wildlife Conservation Trust the Environmental Awareness Group and Black Hills State University joined forces to create the Antiguan Racer Conservation Project (2).

Beaches are also being affected with some beaches being sold for the development of houses hotels and road construction and other beach areas becoming covered with introduced invasive plants creating a habitat unsuitable for egg-laying (1). In addition despite being protected by Honduran law this rare reptile is still hunted locally for its meat (1).,Tremendous conservation efforts have been initiated for the Utila spiny-tailed iguana in an attempt to prevent its extinction.

Having suffered from habitat loss the Hawaiian tree snail is now restricted to just a single location with a population of less than 1000 individuals (5). This species first came under threat when the first settlers on the Hawaiian Islands began logging the lowland forests replacing natural habitats with agricultural lands and cattle ranches. These destructive activities were compounded by the introduction of non-native predators such as rats and the predatory snail <em>Euglandina rosea</em> and alien plant species which overgrow native plant seedlings limiting natural forest regeneration (2). As a result the Hawaiian tree snail listed as a Species of Concern by the United States Fisheries and Wildlife Service is under severe threat of extinction (8). The survival of this species is also hindered by its slow reproduction rate and the degradation of its habitat by feral pigs and goats (5) (6). ÃÂ ,Like many other Hawaiian snail species the restricted geographic range and small population size of the Hawaiian tree snail makes it vulnerable to habitat degradation and consequently its survival may be dependant upon conservation measures (6). Fortunately for this species efforts are underway to protect its fragile habitat. In 2003 the Ponoholo Ranch which encompasses the Hawaiian tree snailÃÂ¢??s habitat entered the Kohala Watershed Partnership which resulted in fencing being built along three sides of the ranch to exclude wild cattle while plans were made to cull wild pigs and remove invasive weeds. The Nature Conservancy has also agreed a 15-year management plan with the ranch with the development of a management plan for the Hawaiian tree snail a key priority (4). This vulnerable species is also benefiting from a captive breeding facility coordinated by the University of Hawaii on Lanai (5). With the successful implementation of these measures and further efforts to remove predators and limit habitat loss there is significant hope that the future of the Endangered Hawaiian tree snail will be secured (1).,loss;,captive breeding;,1,1,yes,3736392,512,472,0,0.921875,2,0.3333333333,,,,,,,,,1.0,1,1,1.0,0,1.0,14,14,0.3793103448,0.5,0.3333333333,0.8971428571,8,0.6190476189999999,7,10,0,1,1,1,1,1,yes,1,0

As a result of these threats the range of the Virgin Islands coqui has become highly fragmented and there is an ongoing decline in the quality of its habitat. The small distinct population on Great Dog is particularly vulnerable. The Virgin Islands coqui also appears to be declining with the spread of the predatory Cuban tree frog (<em>Osteopilus septentrionalis</em>) (1).<em>ÃÂ  </em>,A number of conservation recommendations have been made to protect the native fauna of the British Virgin Islands including the creation of protected areas and minimising the impacts of development through the better enforcement of protective legislation. Increased monitoring efforts for amphibian populations may also be required given the potential for deadly diseases such as the fungus chytridiomycosis to break out on the island especially as disease has been associated with dramatic amphibian declines on nearby islands (6). Additional study and protection of the Virgin Islands coqui population on Great Dog is a conservation priority for the species while there is also a need to afford its habitat on Tortola and Virgin Gorda increased protection and control invasive predators (1) (6).,,protected;,0,1,yes,7281392,7507,919,0,0.1224190755,4,0.0,,,,,,,,,0.4074074074,0,0,0.7092667565999999,6,0.6842105262999999,9,11,0.4186046512,0.5,0.3333333333,0.895993266,11,0.6333333333,16,18,0,1,1,1,1,1,yes,1,0

The Cape stag beetles are amongst the most highly prized beetles on the market (7) with complete sets of <i>Colophon</i> species fetching upward of $10000 and even single specimens of the rarest species being advertised at several thousand dollars (3). Four Germans have recently been caught having captured 211 of these beetles (5). Other threats include habitat damage and loss infrastructure development (such as mobile telephone masts) inappropriate fire regimes human disturbance climate change and over-collection by researchers (4). These threats are exacerbated by the small range occupied by this genus and their suspected low reproductive rate (4).,All <i>Colophon</i> species were given provincial legal protection in 1992 which served to limit legal collection internal trade and export from the province (7) (3). Their listing on Appendix III of CITES also controls import and export of the species across South AfricaÃÂ¢??s borders (2). These laws appear to be fairly rigorously enforced with the four Germans recently caught with over 200 of these rare beetles fined almost ÃÂÃÂ£10000 (5). In 1994 it was proposed that <i>Colophon</i> beetles be upgraded to Appendix I of CITES but the proposal was ultimately withdrawn (7).

The main threat to this species is thought to be habitat loss which is occurring due to excessive groundwater pumping for agriculture (1). The Comanche Spring pupfish has become locally extinct in the spring where it was discovered due to groundwater extraction (1) and excessive water removal is still a problem in the area as much more water being removed than being replaced by rainfall (3). Other threats to this species include competition and <strong>hybridisation</strong> with non-native species such as the sheepshead minnow (<em>Cyprinodon variegatus</em>) (14). An especially large population of this <strong>invasive</strong> fish lives in Lake Balmorhea and the upstream dispersal of this population is proving to be detrimental to the Comanche Springs pupfish (15).,Current conservation efforts for this species are focussed on moderating water level fluctuations and removing <strong>invasive</strong> species (1). A man-made refugium and cienega were constructed in Balmorhea State Park in 1996 in an attempt to provide the Comanche Springs pupfish with a habitat that is not at risk of being drained (15). This wetland area has been located within the boundaries of the natural cienega in an effort to make it resemble and function similarly to the original habitat of this species (16). This conservation measure has proved to be a success and the area is now home to the worldÃÂ¢??s largest Comanche Springs pupfish population.

    These animals are hunted for food and traditional ÃÂ¢??medicine,ÃÂ¢?? sometimes as illegal exports to China. Habitat loss for agriculture and wood extraction is also a major threat. A large length of the Chindwin (where the species was discovered) and its adjacent plains are scheduled to be inundated by the Tazone hydro-electric power dam. As well as direct loss of habitat through inundation this will result in massive increases in hunting as the construction labourers will be expected to live off the land, and the reservoir formed will greatly increase accessibility to a huge area of foothill forest; without specific, directed, management, hunters will no doubt take advantage of this. A very large area of suitable habitat falls within the proposed Hukaung Tiger Reserve, but it is unclear whether this area supports morphologically typical animals. If they do not occur in Hukaung, habitat loss is a sever threat to the species, because most other protected areas in the Myanmar part of its range are highland, and habitat below 900 m is heavily degraded and fragmented, and such processes are ongoing.

Low reproductive rates which exacerbate the problem by making recovery slow could be due to low pollen production low establishment of seedlings and the decline of natural pollinators (5). An additional fear is low genetic variability as a result of inbreeding between the few remaining plants will mean failure to produce healthy seedlings able of responding to environmental change (4).,The Conservation Department of the National Tropical Botanical Garden (NTBG) in Hawaii has taken a lead in the conservation of this rare and unusual species by conducting manual pollination and seed collection. As a result cultivated conservation collections have been established which will ensure against total extinction. Recovery plans are being created that will investigate possible alternative pollinators and create guidelines for the reintroduction of the puaÃÂ¢??ala (4).

Although the Evrotas River naturally dries up during periods of drought water extraction for agriculture has exacerbated this resulting in fish being stranded in stagnant pools of water with low oxygen concentration and high temperatures (1) (6). This was most severe in 2007 when a prolonged drought resulted in around 80 percent of the main river course drying up (6). As the European dace inhabits fast flowing cold waters mass fish mortality has been observed in areas where its habitat has been degraded in such a way (5). Fish communities within the Evrotas River have also suffered from pollution with lowland parts of the river often near urban areas being the most severely effected (1) (6).,The Evrotas River home to the European dace is a unique biodiversity hotspot within Greece. Its waters support many <strong>endemic</strong> species of plants and fish and consequently protecting this fragile environment is a key conservation priority (6).

This has been caused by introduced predatory fish primarily the smallmouth bass (<i>Micropterus dolomieu</i>) in addition to habitat degradation and fragmentation (2).  As the Olifants River region experiences hot dry summers water is extracted from the main river and its tributaries to irrigate the surrounding agricultural land.  Impoundments are also constructed to store water after the winter rainy season.  Furthermore river beds are bulldozed into wide channels to prevent the adjacent land from being flooded in the rainy season (2).  Such activities greatly alter the habitat of the sawfin and restrict its ability to move freely between different areas.,CapeNature a public institution responsible for biodiversity in the Western Cape (5) classifies the sawfin as endangered which makes it an offence to remove captured fish from rivers and dams.  CapeNature also undertakes regular surveys of the Olifants River system and has successfully cultured the sawfin since 1994.

    Historical exploitation for its valuable timber during the 19th centry led to a reduction of up to 95%. One consequence of this was the expansion of fynbos, a highly flammable vegetation formation. More frequent and more intense fires prevent regeneration; surviving trees are restricted to rocky ridges, ledges, and outcrops mostly beyond reach of the flames. Natural regeneration is also hampered as a result of granivory and herbivory by native rodents.

The wood is considered enormously valuable being very fragrant and resistant to termites borers and fungal disease. It is used locally for making carvings boxes and furniture sold to tourists and is also sold abroad for light construction and flooring. The timber is thought to be particularly good for boat-building to the point that fishery officials have urged that remaining supplies be reserved for the Lake Malawi fishing industry. The Forestry Department of Malawi have recently agreed to supply Mulanje Cedar to build 450 boats for this purpose (11). The treeÃÂ¢??s decline has been somewhat stemmed by a ban on felling allowing exploitation only of dead trees but illegal felling and killing of trees continues at an alarming rate. The Mulanje Mountain Forest Reserve is also generally threatened by encroachment and large-scale development such as the continual threat of bauxite mining. Additionally there is concern that mature individuals appear to be dying at a high rate thought possibly to be due to their high sensitivity to forest fires and susceptibility to attacks by a species of aphid (3). Regeneration on the other hand seems to depend on fire and is extremely poor. In addition <i>Pinus patula</i> (originally a commercial plantation species) has invaded a number of areas suitable for <i>Widdringtonia</i> colonisation (5) (9). All these threats have greatly impacted the Mulanje cedar; a 2007 study found that the remaining Mulanje cedar forests had been reduced by 40 percent over the previous 15 years (3). Out of the remaining 845.3 hectares of forest identified over 32 percent of standing Mulanje cedar was found to be dead (3). As so much dead wood is available for utilisation there should be no reason to cut live Mulanje cedar (3).,All Mulanje cedars are protected within the Mulanje Mountain Forest Reserve and licences are available now only for the exploitation of dead trees from the Forestry Department of Malawi (3) (9). The Mulanje Mountain Conservation Trust has also been set up to provide long-term support for the research and conservation of biological diversity in the Mulanje Mountain Forest Reserve and the sustainable utilisation of its natural resources. The Trust is working with the Forestry Department of Malawi in bringing in community participation to manage the resources of the forest reserve and maximise the benefits among resource users (12).

This led to higher algal biomass and decreased levels of dissolved oxygen in the water (4) (5).

Many of the remaining habitats are fragmented and ecological barriers prevent movement of individuals between the forest fragments (1) (2). The formation of fragmented habitats has left most populations of the blue-eyed bush frog at high risk of extinction due to <strong>inbreeding</strong> stress and has increased their vulnerability to invasive species. Any further reductions in habitat area could compromise the future survival of this species (2).,Some areas within the range of the blue-eyed bush frog are protected including the Sharavathi Valley Wildlife Sanctuary Mookambika Wildlife Sanctuary and Kudremukh National Park offering it a certain degree of protection. More research is required into the range habitat requirements and populations of the blue-eyed bush frog and investigations are needed into how threats can be addressed to conserve this colourful amphibian (1).ÃÂ ,invasive;,protected;,1,1,yes,1175789,4369,148,0,0.03387502861,4,0.0,0.09090909091,0.3333333333,0.2,0.6409356725,17.0,0.32,1.0,6.0,1.0,1,1,1.0,0,1.0,13,13,0.2857142857,0.5,0.3333333333,0.8609250398999999,8,0.6363636364,11,11,0,1,1,1,1,1,yes,1,0

    The threats are not known, but it is likely that this species is being impacted by collectors and given the small size of the population is likley to be experiencing recruitment problems.

In addition this cycad is used in numerous ways by the local human population and some of this exploitation is having a negative impact on cycad numbers. <i>Cycas circinalis</i> is heavily harvested for its leaves with young leaves being used as food and medicine by indigenous and local communities and the mature leaves being sold in the floriculture industry (7). The biggest impact on <i>C. circinalis </i>populations however comes from the harvest of pith and male cone for the medicinal plant industry. While much of this harvest is illegal it is very difficult to patrol (7). It is not only the cycad itself that this harvesting may threaten; the harvesting of its seeds for human consumption appears to have little negative impact on <i>Cycas circinalis</i> populations but very heavy seed harvest could have an impact on the bats which reportedly feed on the seeds (7).,Significant populations of <i>Cycas circinalis</i> still exist in a number of national parks and forest reserves (2) which offers this species some protection. To reduce harvesting pressure on populations it has been suggested that people need to be encouraged to use substitutes. For example the floriculture industry could use leaves from cultivated palms that are faster growing. A substitute for the pith and male cone for the medicinal plant industry is not likely and thus in these cases populations need to be increased through cultivation (7).,,,0,0,yes,2039489,5334,257,0,0.04818147732,4,0.0,,,,,,,,,1.0,1,1,1.0,0,1.0,10,10,0.2580645161,0.5,0.3333333333,0.8263157895000001,8,0.5789473684,8,9,0,1,1,1,1,1,yes,1,0

This tadpole showed symptoms of chytridiomycosis a disease that causes death in frogs and is thought to contribute to declines and even extinctions in frog species around the world (1) (6). There are also significant concerns over the possible effects of a road situated very near to one of the locations where the frog has been located (1). In addition various species of water frog are sometimes consumed as part of drink with supposed aphrodisiac qualities and this may also have contributed to the decline of this species (7).,Despite <em>Telmatobius espadai </em>being classified as Critically Endangered by the IUCN Red List there are presently no known conservation methods in place for this species and no current information on its status.

Its disappearance from a site in West Cornwall was due to the surfacing of a lay-by.,This species' rarity and the precarious state of its habitat meant that it was included in the original UK Biodiversity Action Plans for species and it is also listed in English Nature's Species Recovery Programme (SRP). Initial work on conserving the Cornish path moss concentrated on maintaining the plant's only known site and in 1996 it was designated a Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI). With the moss's sites now under protection a management plan was produced and an <glos><i>ex-situ</i></glos> conservation programme was begun to propagate the moss and allow for possible introduction to other suitable sites. This was part of the bryophyte conservation programme run by the Royal Botanic Gardens Kew and should provide an insurance safeguard against the extinction of this species in the wild.
