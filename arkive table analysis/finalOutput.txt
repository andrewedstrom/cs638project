Alcatraz de Abbott; Piquero de Abbott,Papasula abbotti,Abbott's booby (Papasula abbotti),Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Pelecaniformes,Sulidae,Papasula (1),Length: 79 cm (2),Phosphate mining on Christmas Island in the 1960s and 70s caused the destruction of a third of Abbott's booby nesting habitat and has led to the subsequent deterioration of the remaining forest (4). Birds are strongly attached to nest sites and clearings are more exposed to wind turbulence which has a detrimental effect on breeding success and causes higher adult mortality (6). Recent development proposals for the island have again raised concern over the viability of remaining breeding habitat (5).,The majority of Abbott's booby nest sites occur within the Christmas Island National Park which was established in 1980 and covers 63 percent of the island (6). Nest site locations are monitored and the regeneration of previously cleared forest has occurred on much of the island (5). Although mining was resumed in 1990 it only involved the reworking of previously mined areas (6). The continued preservation and ban on clearing of the unique Christmas Island rainforest will be the key to the future viability of the Abbott's booby population (5). , , ,[<p class="Status"><p>Classified as Endangered (EN) on the IUCN Red List 2007 (1) and listed on Appendix 1 of CITES (3).</p></p>],OrderedDict([(u'CX' 1) (u'AU' 1)]),

Thankfully it was rediscovered in 1992 after 33 years of being presumed extinct (3). Currently only ten small populations of the Adelaide pygmy bluetongue skinkare known to exist (6). Arguably Australiaâs most enigmatic reptile its scarcity can be attributed to its unique ecology as well as population declines due to extensive habitat destruction (2)(3).,The South Australia Department of Environment and Conservation has produced a National Recovery Plan for the Adelaide pygmy bluetongue skink with the overall objective to achieve down-listing of the species from Endangered to Vulnerable within 10 years. The plan details actions such as ensuring remaining habitat is protected from any further degradation and undertaking field studies to establish the skinkâs habitat requirements (6). At present all populations of the Adelaide pygmy bluetongue skink occur on private land making the establishment of agreements with landowners an essential part of any plan and incentives may be offered to landowners to become involved in establishing sanctuaries for the Adelaide pygmy bluetongue skink on their land (6). , ,protected; ,[<p class="Status"><p>Classified as Endangered (EN) on the IUCN Red List (1).</p></p>],OrderedDict([(u'AU' 1)]),

black-footed penguin; jackass penguin,Spheniscus demersus,African penguin (Spheniscus demersus),Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Sphenisciformes,Spheniscidae,Spheniscus (1),Length: 60 - 70 cm (2),The population of the African penguin has declined and it is estimated that its current size is a mere 10 percent of what it was at the turn of the 20th Century. Originally the fall in numbers was the result of the over-collection of eggs for food and disturbance caused by the collection of <strong>guano</strong> for fertiliser. Today however depleted fish stocks due to over-fishing and the risk of oil pollution are the most pertinent threats to the survival of the African penguin (5); a recent oil spill affected around 40 percent of the population.  Predation by Cape fur seals (<em>Arctocephalus pusillus</em>) and competition with them for food and breeding sites as well as shark predation has also had severe effects on African penguin numbers (2). The ongoing and rapid decline of the African penguin led to the species being uplisted from Vulnerable to Endangered on the IUCN Red List in 2010 (2).,The African penguin is protected by its listing on Appendix II of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) (3) and on Appendix II of the Convention on Migratory Species (CMS) (4). All of the breeding areas of the African penguin in South Africa are protected as National Parks or Nature Reserves and the collection of <strong>guano</strong> or eggs is no longer permitted. The recovery of rescued oiled African penguins has also been shown to be successful. Populations need further monitoring and the possibility of conserving fish stocks is under investigation amongst other measures if the future of Africaâs only penguin is to be secured (2). ,fishing;pet;pollution; ,cites;protected; ,[<p class="Status"><p>The African penguin is classified as Endangered (EN) on the IUCN Red List (1).

Cape hunting dog; painted hunting dog,Lycaon pictus,African wild dog (Lycaon pictus),Animalia,Chordata,Mammalia,Carnivora,Canidae,Lycaon (1),18 - 34 kg (2),African wild dogs require large home ranges to support viable populations and recent habitat fragmentation has caused a population decline (4). African wild dogs traditionally have a reputation for attacking livestock and despite this rarely occurring in practice they are therefore often persecuted wherever they come into contact with humans (2) (4). In addition road accidents and incidental snaring have recently become an important cause of mortality (2). These wild dogs are susceptible to disease; particularly those carried by domestic dogs such as canine distemper and rabies. A final threat that keeps African wild dog populations low is competition and predation with the other large carnivores of the African savanna such as lions and spotted hyaenas (6).,The current population of African wild dogs is estimated to be less than 5500 individuals (2). The majority of dogs are found in medium sized populations which are extremely vulnerable to sudden environmental change. Due to their expansive home ranges large areas of contiguous habitat are the key to the survival of this species and it is estimated that protected areas need to be greater than 10000 square kilometres in order to prevent detrimental contact with local human settlements (2) (4). Consequently even most of the larger reserves cannot fully contain African wild dog packs leading to clashes with humans (2).

Hemignathus wilsoni,Hemignathus munroi,Akiapola'au (Hemignathus munroi),Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Drepanididae,Hemignathus (1),Length: 14 cm (2),As with many species on Hawaii the âAkiapolaâau is threatened by deforestation and habitat degradation due to livestock grazing and is also preyed upon by introduced rats and feral cats. The introduction of mosquitoes to Hawaii has resulted in the spread of avian diseases which confine many bird species including the âAkiapolaâau to higher elevations. This species has a low reproductive rate and is slow to recover from population reductions (2).,Relatively large âAkiapolaâau populations are found within the boundaries of Kaâu Forest Reserve and Hakalau Forest National Wildlife Refuge. Outside these areas some habitat is being restored (2) and young koa forests on the volcano of Mauna Loa now support high densities of Akiapolaau (6). It is hoped that the âAkiapolaâau might be <strong>re-introduced</strong> into other newly restored habitat.

Andean mountain cat; mountain cat.,Leopardus jacobita,Andean cat (Leopardus jacobita),Animalia,Chordata,Mammalia,Carnivora,Felidae,Oreailurus (1),4 kg (2),It is not clear whether the rarity of the Andean cat is a natural phenomenon or attributable to human actions. Alternatively it may simply be a misperception resulting from lack of observations (2). Pelts of this species have been seen in local markets occasionally killed by herders who carry guns (2). The high Andean Indians appear to have little knowledge of this species and the only pelts observed to be used in local ceremonies have been those of the pampas cat (5). There are no records of international trade of this species either. It is therefore thought that hunting of the Andean cat is primarily carried out to protect local cattle (1). The common threat of habitat destruction common worldwide does not apply here as there have been no significant changes in land-use of the high Andes over the last 2000 years. If anything the human population has decreased in these regions (2).,International trade of this species is prohibited by its listing on Appendix I of CITES (3) and according to national legislation the Andean cat is fully protected throughout its range (2). There is a huge gap in our knowledge of this species and how to best protect it. However since the publication of the Cat Action Treasury Plan there have been substantial increases in research efforts (1) (7). The Cat Action Treasury has sponsored surveys to determine the status of this species and improve our understanding of this cat in order to inform conservation measures (8). These surveys confirmed the rarity of this species. The Andean cat has been upgraded from Vulnerable to Endangered on the IUCN Red List (1) (7). It has been suggested by the Andean Cat Alliance (AGA) previously the Committee for the Conservation of the Andean Cat (COCGA) that because this cat needs large areas to live successfully and its range extends over the Andes through international borders a multinational cooperative approach is necessary for its long-term conservation (5). AGA has launched a multinational project to collate and analyse data on the on the Andean cat in order to initiate immediate conservation efforts and in 2004 a conservation action plan was drawn up for the species. The fact that there are no captive specimens or breeding programmes for the Andean cat means that the survival of this species depends on the development and success of these conservation measures (5). ,hunting; ,cites;protected; ,[<p class="Status"><p>Classified as Endangered (EN) on the IUCN Red List (1) and listed on Appendix I of CITES (3).</p></p>],OrderedDict([(u'BO' 1) (u'AR' 1) (u'PE' 1) (u'CL' 1)]),

Although this species remains relatively abundant at some localities a multitude of threats including expanding human settlements agriculture logging livestock grazing charcoal manufacture and the spread of invasive eucalyptus are causing its population to decline. The pressures have already proven severe enough to cause local extinctions around Fort Dauphin near the southern limit of the Angel’s Madagascar frog’s range (1).,While there are no known conservation measures specifically targeting Angel’s Madagascar frog it is found in two protected areas the Andohahela and Midongy-du-Sud National Parks (1).

In rural areas sewage is rarely treated before being discarded and industrial and domestic waste is sometimes disposed of in caves. Another threat comes from over-harvesting of freshwater which may lead to <strong>saline waters</strong> creeping into the normally freshwater zone. The human population of the Yucatan peninsula is growing so a greater and greater strain on water resources can be expected in the future.

Collection and trade has therefore taken its toll on many chameleon species but international trade in this species is now prohibited (9). However habitat degradation remains a threat even though the species is found within a national park. As this species depends on the presence of leaf litter for food shelter and laying its eggs and also on low shrubs and seedlings for roosting at night its survival is dependent on maintaining the existing vegetation structure within the Tsingy forests (5) (10).,The Antsingy leaf chameleon is listed on Appendix I of the Convention on International Trade of Endangered Species (CITES) and as such international trade of this species is illegal (3).

Numbers of Apolinar’s wren have indeed declined significantly in the last 50 to 70 years primarily due to a 95 percent loss in habitat (3). A significant cause of this habitat destruction is the burning of wetlands for agriculture mainly onion cultivation and cattle-farming. With agriculture also frequently comes the use of insecticides and other chemicals resulting in a reduction in this bird’s insect prey and posing a toxic threat to the bird. In areas around the capital Bogotá remaining wetland habitats are at risk from human settlement and highway development and reed-harvesting and tourism also pose minor threats (1).,Apolinar’s wren occurs in El Cocuy National Park Boyacá and in Sumapáz National Park Cundinamarca which may offer protection against the threat of habitat loss (2). ,loss; ,captive breeding; ,[<p class="Status"><p>Classified as Endangered (EN) on the IUCN Red List (1).</p></p>],OrderedDict([(u'CO' 1)]),

Unfortunately the species’ dependence upon visiting waterholes leaves it vulnerable to ambush by poachers (3). Human migrations to urban areas have increased in Oman in recent years resulting in domestic goats being left to become feral which now forage in areas that were once the realm of the tahr. Additionally several roads and buildings have been constructed near and within the tahr’s range which are new potential sources of disturbance pollution and habitat fragmentation. In particular plans for mineral extraction in southern parts of the range could result in significant habitat loss (6). Tahr populations in UAE appear to be especially localised and possibly isolated. The concern is that isolation of sub-populations will lead to the diminished genetic variation associated with inbreeding which in turn results in increased susceptibility to disease and decreased fertility spelling disaster for the Arabian tahr in UAE (3).,In 1973 efforts were initiated to protect the Arabian tahr and in 1975 active protection was granted over a wide range of the eastern Hajar Mountains of Oman with local men recruited as rangers under the Office of the Advisor for Conservation of the Environment (6). Unfortunately this area still awaits to be awarded official status by a Royal Decree with an approved funded and implemented management plan (6) (7).

When the last wild birds in Japan were taken into captivity in 1981 the species was believed to be extinct in the wild but later that year a tiny population of seven birds was discovered in a remote mountainous area of Shaanxi Province in China (4) (5) (9). Thanks to the implementation of a conservation programme and the enforcement of laws protecting habitat the wild population had risen to more than 600 wild individuals by 2009 (4) (5). However although its population continues to increase there are still fears for the Asian crested ibis with various factors still threatening to undermine this speciesâ recovery. Indeed the ongoing conversion of rice fields to dry wheat production is rapidly reducing the availability of feeding areas. Additional threats include the use of agrochemicals at feeding sites occasional hunting and low genetic diversity (4) (9).,In addition to its legal protection in China numerous conservation measures have been introduced since the Asian crested ibisâ rediscovery including the protection of nesting sites and the periodic prohibition of logging hunting with firearms and usage of agrochemicals (4) (9). As of 2009 there are around 500 birds occurring within several captive breeding programmes (5).

Vast tracts of land have been logged or simply cleared to accommodate the growing human population in the region (2). Such disturbance from infrastructure development can also cause increased stress and confusion amongst elephants (8). Elephant populations have become increasingly isolated in the fragmented habitat that remains often coming into conflict with local farmers (7). Crops are damaged and lives lost; up to 300 people a year are killed by elephants in India (4) leading to retaliation on local elephants (9). Poaching for ivory is also a threat and because only males have tusks populations can become extremely skewed towards females thus affecting breeding rates (2).,The Asian elephant is protected from international trade by its listing on Appendix I of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) although illegal poaching remains a problem (4). Many elephants occur within protected reserves but these are often too small to accommodate them leading to human-elephant conflict (4). Many elephant populations are also found along international borders where management may be weak and a lack of trans-boundary cooperation also hinders elephant protection and management (8). The creation of wildlife corridors to extend reserve lands together with the cessation of poaching are just some of the conservation steps needed to secure the future of the Asian elephant (9).

Habitat destruction poses the predominant threat as a result of land being cleared for human settlement and agriculture and rivers being dammed and land flooded for hydroelectric development (11). In Sumatra uncontrolled illegal logging still occurs. The tapir population is strongest in Malaysia where deforestation has greatly declined (1).,Protective game laws exist in Thailand Myanmar Malaysia and Indonesia with varying success (11). In Malaysia the Asian tapir has been given total protection since 1955 under the Wild Animals and Birds Ordinance and law enforcement has generally been effective. The use of steel wire snares has been banned here with stiff penalties if caught. However ongoing monitoring of the illegal tapir trade across the range of this species is crucial (2). Asian tapirs can be found in a number of protected areas including the Huai Kha Khaeng Wildlife Sanctuary and the Khao Sok National Park in Thailand 12 protected areas in the Western Forest Complex along the Thai-Myanmar border (1) and the Way Kambas National Park in Sumatra which contains around 200 individuals (11).

The extreme isolation of many of the subpopulations is in itself a threat as genetic problems can result from inbreeding (7). Overgrazing by livestock reduces food availability and herders also reduce the availability of water at springs. The cutting down of nutritious shrubs and bushes exacerbates the problem. Furthermore a series of drought years could have devastating effects on this beleaguered species (6). Habitat fragmentation is a particular concern in Mongolia as result of the increasingly dense network of roads railway lines and fences required to support mining activities (1) (5).,The Asiatic wild ass does occur in a number of protected sites where targeted conservation action has been taken. Domestic animals have been removed from some protected areas and artificial watering holes have been made. Hay is provided for the species and there are hefty fines for poaching. Moreover the species is legally protected in many of the countries in which it occurs (6). The priority for future conservation measures is: to ensure the protection of this species in particularly vulnerable parts of its range; to encourage the involvement of local people in the conservation of the Asiatic wild ass; and to conduct further research into the behaviour ecology and taxonomy of the species (1).

Such a limited range places the bird at risk from chance events such as natural disasters or the introduction of mammalian predators (2) (6). On Gough predation by the introduced house mouse (<i>Mus musculus</i>) is having a severe effect on the Atlantic petrel’s breeding success with just two percent of the chicks reaching fledging in 2007 (2). The large population of native southern skua (<i>Catharacta antarctica</i>) are also known to feed on seabirds including the Atlantic petrel (2).,Gough Island is both a Nature Reserve and World Heritage Site and while this provides good protection from human disturbance it does not offer the Gough bunting any protection from the mouse predation that is driving it towards extinction (2). A study of the mice conducted by The Royal Society for the Protection of Birds (RSPB) and funded by the UK government's Overseas Territories Environment Programme has shown that their eradication from the island is feasible. Unfortunately however until adequate funding is acquired this will not occur (7).

Illegal and poorly controlled logging pose the greatest threat to the baku’s continued existence (2) but it has also been reported that the reduction of forest elephant numbers in certain areas may limit the natural regeneration of baku (2) (8).,Baku trees are protected by law in Côte d'Ivoire and due to the problem of overexploitation of timbers Ghana and Liberia have imposed bans on the exporting of baku in log form (8) (9).

Extinction is thought imminent in Vietnam and in Cambodia and Lao PDR habitat fragmentation caused by agriculture and new settlements is seriously threatening the remaining mainland Asian populations (3). These wild cattle have been domesticated in numerous locations most notably on the island of Bali with over 1.5 million domestic banteng thought to exist (2). Interbreeding with domestic and feral cattle threatens to contaminate the gene pool by hybridization of the remaining wild banteng and disease transmission from domestic livestock is also considered a serious danger (1) (6). The number of banteng trophies reported for sale within Cambodia and the Lao PDR along the Thai/Cambodia Thai/Lao and Thai/Myanmar borders strongly suggests that the banteng population on the mainland has been and remains under considerable pressure from hunters (2) (3). Despite legal prohibitions against trade in banteng law enforcement is inadequate and poaching and illegal trade in their meat and horns remains widespread (6) (7).,The banteng is legally protected across its range and occurs in a number of protected areas (1). However the natural resources of reserves often continue to be exploited with about 12 banteng poached annually for example in Baluran National Park Java (7). Several on-going field survey programmes exist (e.g. in Indochina) and a monitoring programme is conducted in East Java. A large captive population is maintained world-wide (1) with European zoos first importing captive banteng from collections in Indonesia as early as 1867 (4). Such populations provide a buffer against total extinction offer potential for future reintroductions into the wild and can be managed to maintain the genetic diversity of the species. In addition they now have a new and exciting role that utilises the very cutting edge of technology and scientific knowledge – cloning! For the first time on April 1st 2003 a healthy clone of this endangered species was born offering powerful evidence that cloning technology can play a role in preserving and even reconstituting threatened and endangered species (8). ,loss;fragmentation;hunting;poaching;disease; ,protected; ,[<p class="Status"><p>Classified as Endangered (EN) on the IUCN Red List (1).</p></p>],OrderedDict([(u'BD' 1) (u'CM' 1) (u'MM' 1) (u'KH' 1) (u'TH' 1) (u'IN' 1) (u'MY' 1) (u'ID' 1)]),

However the extent to which this threatens the species is not clear; the remote rugged habitat of breeding colonies may have limited access for these alien species (3). In the last 50 or so years urban development on the island has led to a dramatic increase in the number and intensity of streetlights and other bright lights which confuse large numbers of fledging Barau’s petrels on their way to the sea at night. Grounded birds are then usually killed by vehicles or predated by dogs and cats. An additional potential threat comes from the increasing pressure for tourism to remote areas which could result in human disturbance at the nesting colonies (5).,A campaign was implemented to raise public awareness of the effect of urban lighting on petrels and to rescue as many grounded birds as possible. Each year many Barau’s petrels are now found and rescued with increasing success; in 2001 787 petrels were rescued (2) (5). There are also proposals to reduce light pollution on the island (2). Increasing tourism suggests that conservation efforts should include strict regulation of human activities near the colonies particularly hiking and mountaineering. Efforts should also be made to eradicate potential predators from the nesting colonies (5). ,pet; , ,[<p class="Status"><p>Classified as Endangered (EN) on the IUCN Red List 2007 (1).</p></p>],OrderedDict([(u'MV' 1)]),

Logging of marri first for woodchips and now for use in flooring and furniture has dramatically reduced the availability of food and nesting trees. Additionally many nest hollows have been found to be occupied by <strong>feral</strong> bees which not only limit the bird’s nest availability but are also known to have caused the loss of chicks and killed a brooding female. Competition for nests from maned geese (<i>Chenonetta jubatta</i>) and Australian shelduck (<i>Tadorna tadornoides</i>) may also be a factor as duck numbers increase in the south-west (9) (12).,Baudin’s black cockatoo is listed under Appendix II of CITES limiting international trade in the species (3) and it is illegal to take these birds from the wild with a penalty of up to a maximum of $10000 for such an offence (12) (13). This cockatoo is given special protection under <i>Western Australia’s Wildlife Conservation Act 1950</i> (4) and has been protected under Australian law since 1996 (9). Forest management has now changed so that woodchipping practices ceased in 2003 (9) (10). However the bird still clings to a precarious existence and further conservation measures are desperately required to safeguard its future including: making all shooting by commercial orchard farmers illegal; developing non-lethal methods of damage control; developing and implementing a feral bee control strategy; and protecting mature marri trees relied upon so heavily as nest and food sources by this rare <strong>endemic</strong> bird (9).

Areas of prime habitat occur in and around the Morro do Diabo State Park; however five percent of this area was flooded in the early 1980's following the construction of a hydroelectric plant (7). The remaining black lion tamarin populations have been isolated for some time and studies have shown that genetic diversity is extremely low as a result of inbreeding (7). <strong>Inbreeding depression</strong> which can reduce the fitness of the population in terms of survival reproductive capacity and growth is therefore a cause for concern in this species.,A long-term programme of conservation and environmental education targeting the black lion tamarin is underway (7). An important measure to combat the effects of inbreeding will be to allow movement of individuals between the isolated sub-populations. This can occur through <strong>translocations</strong> of individuals or by creating corridors between habitat patches to facilitate movement between populations (4). Corridors have already been planted and some translocations have occurred (7).

It is hoped that its overall declining trend has reversed recently partly due to a change in agricultural practices that has seen more insects and worms being revealed by ploughing. The black-billed gull has developed a habit of following ploughs and aiding farmers by picking out insect pests. However the breeding habitat of the bird continues to decline in size. This reduction in habitat is the cause of the drop in gull numbers over the last 30 years as land is increasingly turned over to agriculture. Additionally breeding habitat is currently threatened by the spread of exotic lupins which clog the waterways (2) (5).,The New Zealand Government has launched the New Zealand Biodiversity Strategy to respond to its obligations under the Convention on Biological Diversity. This includes management of wetland habitats by protecting them from development as well as by planting appropriate plant species in areas recovering from disturbance in order to stabilise the soil and reduce fertiliser run-off that can encourage the growth of exotic species such as lupins at the expense of native species. The water level must be maintained and a water care code has been established to ensure that users of wetland habitats are able to act responsibly (6). , , ,[<p class="Status"><p>The black-billed gull is classified as Endangered (EN) on the IUCN Red List 2006 (1).</p></p>],OrderedDict([(u'NZ' 1)]),

Turtles are highly prized for food and traditional ‘medicinal’ purposes and are ubiquitous in Asian food markets (9). Importation to the U.S. for the pet trade began in the 1980s and most specimens found in pet stores today are still freshly imported from Asia (6) although there is now substantial breeding of the species in China and some of the young exported into the global pet trade may come from farms (2). Nevertheless before reaching their destination many of these turtles have had to endure poor conditions in food markets and are malnourished or develop pneumonia mouth sores or other illnesses and almost all will have parasites from which many die (6). Another important factor in this species’ decline is forest loss and degradation from clearance for agriculture and uncontrolled wildfires (2). Thus the high mortality rate amongst wild-caught leaf turtles combined with unsustainable rates of harvesting from the wild limited use of captive breeding and farming and ongoing habitat loss has led to a serious decline in population numbers and left this enigmatic turtle clinging to a precarious existence (9).,Substantial advances are being made in management and captive breeding of this turtle particularly in central Europe and the U.S. and captive breeding meets most of the serious hobbyist demand. However it remains cheaper to import animals for a few dollars/euros than to obtain captive-bred animals so the cheap pet imports continue and continue to be bought by impulse buyers (2). This pet market combined with habitat loss and the ongoing demand for turtles in the Asian food markets mean the outlook for the black-breasted leaf turtle and most Asian turtle species remains grim (9). ,loss;pet; ,captive breeding; ,[<p class="Status"><p>Classified as Endangered (EN) on the IUCN Red List 2007 (1) and listed on Appendix III of CITES in China (3).</p></p>],OrderedDict([(u'CN' 1) (u'VN' 1)]),

Around this time a burgeoning human population in the Caribbean islands and consequential habitat loss harvesting for food and predation by introduced mammals saw petrel numbers crash almost to the point of extinction. Indeed for several decades prior to the early 1960s the species appeared to have vanished completely. Fortunately in 1963 an estimated 2000 breeding pairs were discovered at the existing colonies in Haiti (7). It soon became evident however that these populations were under the same pressures that extirpated the breeding populations on other islands. By the turn of this century the estimated number of breeding pairs had declined to 1000 with a total population size of approximately 5000 birds (3). Despite increased awareness the population in Haiti is likely to continue to decline as a result of continued conversion of broadleaf forest to cropland and pasture at Parc La Visite. Sadly this downward population trend on the breeding grounds may be further exacerbated by proposals to develop oil and gas fields within petrel foraging grounds off the coast of the USA (2) (15).,Most of the known black-capped petrel breeding populations occur within La Visite National Park and Pic Macaya National Park in Haiti while Sierra de Baoruco National Park in the Dominican Republic also contains small populations (7) (8) (9) (10). However despite official park status the implementation of a sustainable conservation plan in Haiti’s two national parks has no measurable conservation effect due to political instability corruption absence of political will and the abject poverty of the local population who depend critically on the forest for their day-to-day survival. Given that almost the world’s entire black-capped petrel breeding population occurs within these two parks ensuring their protection presents the most critical challenge to conservation efforts (16). Current proposals for Haiti’s National Parks include establishing core ecological reserves that are strictly off-limits to humans maintenance of defined park boundaries and long-term monitoring and research of avian populations (17) (18). However with Haiti’s breeding populations still under threat the presence of alternative nesting sites may be crucial to the species’ survival. ,loss;pet; , ,[<p class="Status"><p>Classified as Endangered (EN) on the IUCN Red List (1).</p></p>],OrderedDict([(u'GP' 2) (u'MQ' 2) (u'CU' 2) (u'DO' 1) (u'DM' 1) (u'HT' 1)]),

As part of the project the Mackenzie River Basin is receiving protection and willows are being removed to restore the breeding habitat of black-fronted terns (7). Information signs have been erected close to large black-fronted tern colonies which aim to educate the public about the best way to enjoy and use the river while minimising the negative impacts on the birds (5). , , ,[<p class="Status"><p>The black-fronted tern is classified as Endangered (EN) on the IUCN Red List (1).</p></p>],OrderedDict([(u'NZ' 1)]),

A decrease in water quality was probably the most significant agent as the loss of the species from the Cahaba River coincided with an increase in nitrogen and phosphorous caused by sewage discharge. This led to higher algal biomass and decreased levels of dissolved oxygen in the water (4) (5). The blue shiner is also threatened by increased siltation as it relies on sight to detect its prey while in Georgia urbanisation and resulting pollution and water extraction threatens the species’ habitat. In many areas the blue shiner now exists in small highly fragmented populations which are more vulnerable to habitat degradation and a loss of <strong>genetic diversity</strong> greatly increasing the species’ extinction risk (5) (7).,The future of the blue shiner very much depends on the protection of its habitat particularly the Conasauga River.

Ouistiti À Tête Jaune,Callithrix flaviceps,Buffy-headed marmoset (Callithrix flaviceps),Animalia,Chordata,Mammalia,Primates,Callitrichidae,Callithrix (1),230 – 453 g (2),Although believed to be a naturally rare species (4) the small range of the buffy-headed marmoset leaves it highly vulnerable to threats such as habitat destruction which is now pushing this diminutive monkey towards extinction.   A burgeoning population and rapid development along the southeastern coastal region of Brazil has taken its toll on the natural forest habitat (2) (6).  The clearance of land for coffee plantations sugar cane cocoa eucalyptus cattle pasture and most significantly timber extraction and charcoal production has left just a tiny fraction of original forest (6).  In addition this threatened primate may also be hunted for the pet trade (1).,Despite the grim picture painted for the future of the buffy-headed marmoset’s habitat it has been reported that this species may be able to adapt to <strong>secondary forest</strong> and that its future could be secured if provided with proper protection (2).  Currently this species is known to occur within the Nova Lombardia Biological Reserve and the forest within the lands of the Fazenda Montes Claros (a privately owned farm) (6).  This provides the buffy-headed marmoset with some protection against the threats of habitat loss but it has been advised that the land of Fazenda Montes Claros should be made into an official protected area so that its future preservation can be assured (6).  Indeed the future of the buffy-headed marmoset may rest on the effective protection of strongholds such as these (6). ,pet; ,protected; ,[<p class="Status"><p>Classified as Endangered (EN) on the IUCN Red List (1) and listed on Appendix I of CITES (3).</p></p>],OrderedDict([(u'BR' 1)]),

In addition habitat clearance is believed to be the cause of its extinction on Mahé (1).  Very few mature bwa sandal trees now remain and this small and restricted population is considered to be in danger of extinction (1).,All remaining populations of the bwa sandal occur within protected areas (1) but there is no information to indicate whether the protection is sufficient and well enough enforced to ensure the bwa sandal’s survival. , ,protected; ,[<p class="Status"><p>Classified as Endangered (EN) on the IUCN Red List 2007 (1).</p></p>],OrderedDict([(u'SC' 1)]),
Bermuda petrel,Pterodroma cahow,Cahow (Pterodroma cahow),Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Procellariiformes,Procellariidae,Pterodroma (1),Length: 38 cm (2),The huge pre-colonial cahow population was rapidly decimated by human hunting for food and by introduced pigs rats dogs and cats which eliminated it from all the larger islands (2) (4) (5). Surviving only on the smallest offshore islets where lack of soil prevented burrowing it was forced to compete for nest sites with the larger cliff-hole-nesting white-tailed tropicbird (<em>Phaethon lepturus</em>) which caused 70 percent breeding failure every year. Rat predation on new-hatched chicks remains as an occasional threat. During the 1960s and early 1970s before DDT pesticide use was banned DDT residues caused a 50 percent decline in breeding success due to eggshell thinning and embryo mortality (7). From the late 1960s through the 1990s light pollution from a nearby NASA tracking station and U.S. Naval air station inhibited new pair formation on the breeding islets (2). Erosion damage to the nesting islets from hurricane overwash has become a major problem due to global warming and sea level rise since 1995 (7).,The rediscovery of the Bermuda petrel’s nesting grounds in 1951 enabled concerted conservation efforts and since 1961 all of the breeding sites have been intensively managed by a conservation officer employed by the Bermuda Government Ministry of the Environment. Periodic invasions of rats are controlled by trapping and baiting with anti-coagulant poisons and nest competition with tropicbirds has been eliminated by the installation of wooden entrances which exclude the larger tropicbirds. In addition man-made concrete burrows have been provided on the level tops of the islets to accommodate the cahow population increase. Furthermore since 1962 the six hectare soil-covered Nonsuch Island has been restored and kept predator-free as a much larger future home for the expanding population (7). ,hunting;pet;pollution; , ,[<p class="Status"><p>The cahow is classified as Endangered (EN) on the IUCN Red List (1) and is listed on Appendix I of the Convention on Migratory Species (CMS or Bonn Convention) (3).</p></p>],OrderedDict([(u'BM' 2) (u'BS' 1)]),
Calamanian deer; Calamian hog deer; Philippine deer,Axis calamianensis,Calamian deer (Axis calamianensis),Animalia,Chordata,Mammalia,Cetartiodactyla,Cervidae,Axis (1),27 – 110 kg (2),These beautiful deer are hunted by local people primarily for their meat although their hides are sometimes used for drum-skins and their antlers for decoration (7).  This hunting which was particularly severe during the mid-1970s but has declined in more recent years (7) has left Calamian deer populations seriously depleted (5).,The most significant conservation measures implemented for this Endangered species to date have been the establishment of the Calauit Island Game Preserve and Wildlife Sanctuary and the introduction of 30 deer to the island (7).  In 1993 the Calamian Deer Conservation Program was also launched an initiative which has led to the undertaking of status surveys research conservation education and the formation of management recommendations.  There are no reserves on Busuanga and Culion but relatively large parts of these islands fortunately remain undeveloped and sparsely inhabited (7). ,hunting;disease; , ,[<p class="Status"><p>Classified as Endangered (EN) on the IUCN Red List 2007 (1) and listed on Appendix I of CITES (3).</p></p>],OrderedDict([(u'PH' 1)]),

Campbell Island flightless teal,Anas nesiotis,Campbell Island teal (Anas nesiotis),Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Anseriformes,Anatidae,Anas (1),Male wingspan: 128 – 138 cm (2)Female wingspan: 114 – 125 cm (2)Male weight: 290 – 500 g (2)Female weight: 280 – 265 (2),Having disappeared from much of its former range the Campbell Island teal population reached critically low numbers and has clung to a precarious existence. This bird’s extirpation from it presumed former stronghold Campbell Island has largely been attributed to predation by introduced Norway rats (<i>Rattus norvegicus</i>) that got ashore from sealing and whaling ships in the early 19th Century (4). Present-day potential threats include the accidental introduction of predators or avian disease to Dent Island the bird’s last natural refuge or even severe weather conditions which could have a catastrophic effect (6). Indeed with such a small current population and limited natural range this bird is now extremely vulnerable; just a single event is capable of driving it to complete extinction (5).,The outlook for the Campbell Island teal looked bleak when first rediscovered in 1975 but thankfully since then there has been fantastic progress with captive breeding programmes and the population has increased to a healthier though still unstable level (5). Captive breeding was started by New Zealand’s Department of Conservation in 1984 from three males and one female taken from the small population on Dent Island and another four males and three females captured in 1990. The first duckling finally hatched in 1994 at the Pukaha Mt Bruce National Wildlife Centre receiving international attention and by 2000 the captive population had reached 60 (4). The Department of Conservation initially released a total of 24 captive-bred birds on to the predator-free Codfish Island in 1999 and 2000 as an insurance population and to be eventually used to restock Campbell Island (4) (5). These had an 88 percent survival rate. With this success the Department of Conservation decided to translocate captive-bred birds directly to Campbell Island made viable by a successful rat and cat eradication programme in 2001 (4). Thus 50 teal including 28 from Pukaha Mount Bruce and 22 from Codfish Island were released onto Campbell Island in September 2004 and a further 55 in September 2005 and 54 in 2006 (4) (5). A check in February 2005 found no evidence that the first batch of released birds had bred but this may be due to their being moved close to the breeding season (4). Two decades of conservation effort have brought this bird back from extinction on Campbell Island and meant that it now has a good chance of being able to recover and thrive once more in its native home (7). ,disease; ,captive breeding; ,[<p class="Status"><p>The Campbell Island teal is classified as Endangered (EN) on the IUCN Red List (1) and listed on Appendix I of CITES (3).</p></p>],OrderedDict([(u'NZ' 1)]),
