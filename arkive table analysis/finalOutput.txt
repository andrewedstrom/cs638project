Animalia,Akepa ,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Fringillidae,Loxops (1),Length: 10 cm (2),With its dependence on large mature trees the extensive forest clearance that has occurred on Hawaii has had a catastrophic effect on the akepa. Not only have significant numbers of mature trees been lost to logging but the remaining exposed trees have become more vulnerable to windfall. Despite reforestation efforts the planted trees take decades to develop natural cavities and cannot possibly provide the akepa with nesting habitat fast enough to offset its rapid population decline (2) (3).,Listed as Endangered by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service in 1970 the akepa was one of the species targeted in the 1982 Hawaii Forest Bird Recovery Plan leading to the improved protection and management of its habitat (3). A number of protected areas currently support akepa populations in particular Hakalau Forest National Wildlife Refuge which contains large numbers. Within these areas reforestation efforts are helping to restore this species\u2019 habitat in the long-term while artificial nesting boxes are providing a promising short-term benefit to the akepa\u2019s survival (2) (3).

Animalia,Amami rabbit ,Animalia,Chordata,Mammalia,Lagomorpha,Leporidae,Pentalagus (1),up to 2 kg (3),Widespread habitat degradation has recently occurred on these islands and it is estimated that as little as 5% of the forest cover of 1981 remains (1). In addition predation by introduced mammalian predators such as dogs cats and mongooses poses a further threat to the survival of this species (4). Mongooses were introduced in the 1980s in an attempt to control the number of habu pit vipers (<i>Trimeresurus flavoviridis</i>) on the island; they have however devastated other species\u2019 populations instead (3).,The Amami rabbit is classified as a Japanese National Monument and as such receives protection from hunting and capture (3). However habitat loss is currently the major threat to the survival of this rare species and the protection of remaining forests will be the key to securing the future of both this unique rabbit and other members of Amami\u2019s natural heritage (3).

Furthermore the extent and quality of its habitat on Borneo is continuing to decline (1).,The Gunung Mulu National Park home to the only known population of the Api dwarf toad is a protected area and the most studied tropical karst area in the world. Nonetheless further survey work is needed to establish the size of the population in the park and to determine whether this species is present in any other limestone karst areas on Borneo (1).

Animalia,Ash-breasted tit-tyrant ,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Tyrannidae,Anairetes (1),Average head-body length: 13 cm (2),Restricted to <em>Polylepis</em> woodlands a highly degraded and depleted habitat the ash-breasted tit-tyrant is extremely vulnerable to habitat loss (2). <em>Polylepis</em> woodlands have suffered from centuries of pressure and now exist in relic fragments scattered across the Peruvian and Bolivian Andes (6). Agriculture has progressively encroached upon this habitat while heavy grazing by livestock which has been particularly intense since the introduction of sheep has limited its natural regeneration. This has been exacerbated in areas where <em>Polylepis</em> woodland is exploited for firewood charcoal production and logging and where competitive exotic trees such as <em>Eucalyptus</em> have been introduced (2). Consequently around 50 percent of natural woodlands have been lost from Abra Malaga in Peru and an alarming 26 percent of original diversity may have already been lost (4) (6). Facing such intense pressure the ash-breasted tit-tyrant has undergone a drastic decline and now the population is near critically low levels (2). \xa0,Although found in a number of protected areas including the actively managed Huascar\xe1n National Park the ash-breasted tit-tyrant urgently requires conservation action (2). Recognising this the American Bird Conservancy in collaboration with Asociaci\xf3n Ecosistemas Andinos a Peruvian conservation organisation is working to preserve and restore <em>Polylepis</em> habitat. Over 120000 plants have been successfully planted while local families have been provided with alternative firewood (7).The ash-breasted tit-tyrant will also benefit from the implementation of a wealth of proposed measures including improved land-use management and community awareness programmes (2). Furthermore two key areas have been identified for the conservation of <em>Polylepis</em> specialist birds and it is hoped that with the implementation of conservation measures in these areas the future of many rare species will be secured (8).
Animalia,Ashy storm-petrel ,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Procellariiformes,Hydrobatidae,Oceanodroma (1),37 g (3),Between the 1880s and 1970s the breeding population of ashy storm-petrels at the South Farallon Islands was stable. However in the early 1990s a twenty-year study reported an alarming decline of 42 percent in the population (2) (3). More recently these findings have been corroborated by other studies showing continued declines on South Farallon and also at several other important breeding sites (2). No one single cause is considered responsible for the decline but rather a combination of several negative pressures. This includes predation of petrels by gulls and owls and on the larger islands introduced mammals such as rats mice and cats. In particular rapid growth in the population of predatory gulls is of considerable concern at many of the nesting sites. Other reported threats include oil and chemical pollution in foraging areas light pollution from fishing vessels increasing the vulnerability of petrels to predation ingestion of plastics and human disturbance. Furthermore there is long-term concern that climate change may disturb the ocean currents and processes of coastal upwelling which form an integral part of a food web supporting ashy storm-petrels and many other organisms (2) (3).,In light of its restricted range and a current population size that is almost certainly less than the 5000 to 10000 breeding birds estimated in the early to mid-1990s the ashy-storm petrel is listed as Endangered on the IUCN Red List (1) (2). Fortunately despite the threats described most of the breeding colonies are on islands either protected from development or subject to sensitive management (2) (3). Current conservation proposals include eradication of all introduced predators from nesting islands an investigation of the impacts of light chemical and plastics pollution and continued monitoring of population trends (2). Presently the ashy storm-petrel is designated by the California Department of Fish and Game as a Bird Species of Conservation Concern but as of May 2008 it is also under review for protection under the Endangered Species Act (ESA) (6). If listed under the ESA the ashy storm-petrel will benefit from the compulsory development of a recovery plan protection and restoration of critical habitat scientific research and public education (7) (8).

Animalia,Atlantic halibut ,Animalia,Chordata,Actinopterygii,Pleuronectiformes,Pleuronectidae,Hippoglossus (1),up to 315 kg (2),The Atlantic halibut has suffered massive declines throughout its range over the last two centuries including virtual elimination in many areas as a result of over-fishing (7). Their slow growth rate and late onset of sexual maturity make these fish extremely vulnerable to the effects of over-fishing (5). Not only does this mean that individuals are often harvested many years before reaching maturity and therefore unable to increase abundance through reproduction but also that populations will be slow to recover from collapses in numbers (7). Since population numbers are now too low to sustain target fisheries Atlantic halibut are predominantly taken as <strong>bycatch</strong> by bottom trawlers and longliners (8). Surveys indicate that these fish have continued to decline in the North Atlantic over the past two decades despite being taken only incidentally as <strong>bycatch</strong> with little targeted halibut fishing (7).,There is currently no management plan in place for this fish and it is therefore thought probable that numbers of Atlantic halibut will continue to decline. It has been argued that Atlantic halibut are unlikely to recover simply by banning halibut landings or designating protected areas. Rather the recovery and survival of this Endangered flatfish species will depend on reducing its <strong>bycatch</strong> in other highly exploited fisheries (7).
Animalia,Atlantic yellow-nosed albatross ,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Procellariiformes,Diomedeidae,Thalassarche (1),2.2 kg (3),As a scavenger of fishing vessel bait the Atlantic yellow-nosed albatross is suffering population declines as a result of longline fishing. Longlining is mainly used to catch tuna and swordfish by releasing a line of baited hooks that sink to the appropriate depth for these fish. Many seabirds dive for the bait before it has sunk becoming caught on the hooks and drowning as the line reaches its final depth. The Atlantic yellow-nosed albatross attends trawlers off the coast of south-eastern Brazil and the west coast of southern Africa (2). It also suffers losses as a result of collisions with cables on trawl vessels (6).,The Atlantic yellow-nosed albatross is monitored on Gough Island which is both a nature reserve and a World Heritage Site. A population census was carried out in 2000/2001 and was repeated in 2004. Remote tracking has also been used in order to determine the distribution of these birds at sea. The information obtained will be used to assess the overlap between the birds and longline fishing operations. Longline fishing is controversial and techniques to reduce the seabird catch have been suggested such as weighting lines to sink them more rapidly and setting them at night (2). A Threat Abatement Plan has been put into action by the Australian government which proposes to promote public awareness of the conservation needs of albatrosses and to reduce the <strong>by-catch</strong> of this species and other albatross species (6).
Animalia,Australian painted snipe ,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Charadriiformes,Rostratulidae,Rostratula (1),125 - 130 g (2),Australian painted snipe numbers are believed to be declining primarily due to the loss of their wetland habitat. Since European settlement an estimated 50 percent of Australian wetlands have been modified for human land use. Drainage and diversion of the water in these wetlands have rendered them unsuitable for the Australian painted snipe and constitute the primary threat to this species (3) (6).,As little is known about the Australian painted snipe conservation efforts have focused on improving knowledge of the species through assessing its habitat preferences developing a database of records and conducting annual surveys. In conjunction with this a number of supplementary measures have also been proposed such as protecting habitat used by the Australian painted snipe and monitoring its population at the landscape scale (4) (6).
Animalia,Azure-rumped tanager ,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Thraupidae,Tangara (1),Length: 15 cm (2),The azure-rumped tanager is threatened by the loss of its forest habitat due to fires logging and agriculture. The area in which it inhabits is optimal land for the cultivation of coffee. As human populations in the region grow the pressure on the remaining natural forest will only increase (2) (5).,The azure-rumped tanager occurs within the El Triunfo Biosphere Reserve an important area protecting some of the last remaining tracts of Central American cloud forest and Pacific Coast tropical evergreen forest. It is a refuge for many rare and endangered species including the azure-rumped tanager. However this too is threatened by the activities of the region\u2019s growing human population (6). Ensuring effective protection of the El Triunfo Biosphere Reserve is one measure proposed to protect populations of the azure-rumped tanager as well as carrying out surveys and creating new protected areas within its range (2).

Animalia,Banggai cardinalfish ,Animalia,Chordata,Actinopterygii,Perciformes,Apogonidae,Pterapogon (1),Length: Up to 80 mm (1),The major threat to the Banggai cardinalfish is overexploitation for the aquarium trade (10) (11). There are currently three main collection centres in the Banggai Archipelago where as many as 100000 individuals may be caught monthly from around the islands before being shipped to Bali and North Sulawesi to be sold to international exporters. During shipping which may take between 24 hours and 5 days up to 30 percent of the fish may die with similar quantities frequently being rejected due to poor condition. A study of the Banggai cardinalfish fishery revealed that during 2007 at least 1000000 individuals were caught which given that the fish\u2019s total population in this year was estimated to be 2200000 individuals is a serious cause for concern. Indeed the increasing levels of exploitation have led to the extermination of two local populations while the global population of the Banggai cardinalfish is believed to have been reduced to about 10 percent of its historical abundance and range (11).,A successful captive-breeding program has been developed by the New Jersey Academy for Aquatic Sciences. However the aquarium trade has not yet made any significant efforts to replace wild-caught fish with captive-bred fish (1).
Animalia,Bare-necked umbrellabird ,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Cotingidae,Cephalopterus (1),Length: 36 - 41 cm (2) (3)Male weight: ca. 450 g (2)Female weight: ca. 320 g (2),The bare-necked umbrellabird appears to be relatively uncommon throughout its range with a small and declining global population. Although it occurs in adequately protected highland forests much of the species\u2019 lowland habitat is unprotected and is under continued threat from deforestation and conversion to plantations and cattle ranches (2) (3) (5) (6) (7). A lack of suitable habitat corridors between lowland and highland areas may also be a problem (5) and recent highway construction is further removing the species\u2019 habitat and opening the region up to increased settlement and land clearance (3) (5). In addition to these threats global climate change could potentially shift the bare-necked umbrellabird\u2019s range up to higher elevations eventually leaving the species with nowhere else to go (6).,The bare-necked umbrellabird breeds in several protected areas including La Amistad International Park and Monteverde Cloud Forest Reserve in Costa Rica (3) (5). The adjacent lowlands where these birds spend the non-breeding season are less well protected (3) (7) but lowland protected areas used by the bare-necked umbrellabird include San San-Pond Sak a Ramsar site in Panama (2) (9) and La Selva Biological Station in Costa Rica (3). Further conservation actions recommended for the bare-necked umbrellabird include population monitoring the preservation and promotion of forest corridors and the establishment and expansion of protected areas especially in lowland areas (2) (3) (5) (7). Protecting the habitats of this distinctive bird would also help to preserve many other species that depend on these forests for survival (7).

Animalia,Barren’s topminnow ,Animalia,Chordata,Actinopterygii,Cyprinodontiformes,Cyprinodontidae,Fundulus (1),Length: up to 7 cm (2),With an extremely limited distribution and an accordingly small population the Barren\u2019s topminnow is particularly vulnerable to extinction from both natural and artificial causes (3). In 1998 a drought at the pool where this species was discovered required the removal of the entire local population. The fish were housed in an artificial facility and re-released after heavy rains replenished the water (5). Along with natural incidents habitat degradation and development are also significantly affecting this species (3) (5). Perhaps the most severe threat to this species however is the introduced non-native western mosquitofish <i>Gambusia affinis</i> (6) (7). Artificially introduced to control mosquitoes by preying on the aquatic larvae this species has becomes widespread and has invaded the range of the Barren\u2019s topminnow (7). The invasive species preys on the larval and juvenile stages of Barren\u2019s topminnow resulting in catastrophic local population declines (6) (8).,Though considered endangered by the state of Tennessee the Barren\u2019s topminnow does not currently receive Federal protection (3) (5). Fortunately however concerted efforts are being made to conserve this imperilled species. In 2001 the Barren\u2019s topminnow Working Group was established which has been responsible for implementing programmes to restock the Barren\u2019s topminnow at over 24 sites throughout much of its historic range. While many restocking efforts appear to have proven successful with successful wild breeding occurring the presence of mosquitofish remains problematic (4). The group is therefore researching and implementing ways to minimise the impacts of the invasive species including the creation of barriers around one pool occupied by this species to prevent the mosquitofish from entering (4) (5). The group is also undertaking studies to determine the effects of habitat loss and degradation (4). In order to address this threat it is clear that land management practices encouraging the formation of open water habitats favoured by this species are necessary (3).
Animalia,Basking malachite ,Animalia,Arthropoda,Insecta,Odonata,Synlestidae,Chlorolestes (1),Length: 43 - 45 mm (2),The habitat of the basking malachite is situated within the prime agricultural lands of the Eastern Cape of South Africa and the trampling of cattle on riverbanks is destroying the plants upon which females deposit their eggs (5). The shading of streams by the invasive black wattle (<i>Acacia mearnsii</i>) is further depleting available habitat for this damselfly (5).,<i>Acacia</i> spp. are being removed as part of the 'Working for Water' programme and discussions with local farmers are needed to ensure that cattle are allowed only to enter the water in certain areas along the riverbank therefore preserving the remaining habitat of this beautiful species (5).

Animalia,Bellamya ,Animalia,Mollusca,Gastropoda,Architaenioglossa,Viviparidae,Bellamya (1),,While the population of <em>Bellamya crawshayi</em> is currently thought to be stable this species is <strong>endemic</strong> to a single lake that is rapidly decreasing in size as a result of environmental changes including global climate change. Lake Mweru is increasingly drying out and becoming shallower and may in fact be completely dry within the next 50 years. The lake is currently only around three metres deep on average but when it reaches between one and two metres in depth monsoon rains mix the mud and water resulting in increases in salinity and a decrease in oxygen levels. <em>Bellamya crawshayi</em> is extremely vulnerable to these changes which are already known to have caused the extinction of related species in other lakes (1).\xa0,<em>Bellamya crawshayi </em>has not been the target of any known conservation measures. Recommended actions for this species as well as for other animals inhabiting Lake Mweru includes population monitoring and research to determine how best to mitigate the threat of climate change (1).\xa0

Animalia,Big-headed turtle ,Animalia,Chordata,Reptilia,Testudines,Platysternidae,Platysternon (1),Carapace length: up to 20.1 cm (2),Legal and illegal trade are thought to pose the main threats to the big-headed turtle which commonly appears in Asian food markets and is in particular demand in China Lao PDR and Vietnam (1) (6) (8). The species is also sold by pet traders and sadly its increasing scarcity in the wild is only likely to lead to a greater demand for the species and higher market value encouraging further collection from the wild. Furthermore since the reproductive rate is thought to be very low populations of this species are believed to be very sensitive to removal of individuals and are slow to recover (8).,The big-headed turtle is legally protected in parts of its range and is likely to occur in protected areas (8). However extensive and significant illegal international trade apparently continues. Captive breeding cannot supply demand but does occur on an extremely limited scale in Thailand and reportedly also occurs for commercial sale on Chinese turtle farms (8).

It also occurs within the Central Cebu National Park however this site offers little protection.  Further surveys and research of this species is required to enable the development of effective management plans and this obviously needs to be carried out in addition to efforts to conserve the remaining natural habitat on Cebu (4).

Animalia,Black-browed albatross ,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Procellariiformes,Diomedeidae,Thalassarche (1),Length: 80 - 95 cm (2)Wingspan: 200 - 235 cm (2),The greatest threat to this species is thought to be the increase in <strong>by-catch</strong> as a result of long-line sea fishing in the southern oceans especially along the Patagonian shelf off the east coast of Argentina and Uruguay (5). An estimated 60 percent of the total breeding population of around 530 000 individuals breed on the Falkland Islands and another 20 percent on South Georgia (5). The Falklands population has declined by almost a third during the last two decades most of this within a period of five years to 2001 (5). Much of this decline is blamed on an increase in long-line fishing in the surrounding seas but the black-browed albatross is at risk from this practice throughout its range. It is one of the most frequent victims of both long-line and trawler fishing in the southern hemisphere (5).,As a result of fears over its declining population the IUCN has upgraded the status of the black-browed albatross to \u2018Endangered\u2019 (1). On the basis of the losses at the birds\u2019 chief breeding sites it is calculated that it will have declined by around 65 percent during the next 65 years and by more than 50 percent throughout the rest of its range over the same period (5).

The small number of wintering sites means that the species is very vulnerable to any chance event that may occur particularly to the potentially catastrophic effects of pollution (6).,The black-faced spoonbill is protected in China Taiwan North Korea South Korea and Japan and a number of both breeding and wintering sites are protected as sanctuaries (2). An Action Plan for the species was produced in 1995 following an international workshop; the Wild Bird Society of Japan acts as the secretariat of the Black-faced Spoonbill Conservation Network (6). Educational and research programmes have been undertaken in a number of countries and an international census has been established and run by Hong Kong Bird Watching Society (4).

Pollution from rubbish disposal commercial run-off and septic discharge is a particular problem at several locations and can lead to nitrification promoting weed infestations.\xa0Earthworks for the establishment of sewage pipelines and poor erosion control mechanisms has also resulted in sedimentation causing swamps to dry up.\xa0Furthermore the Blue Mountains water skink\u2019s range is intersected by corridors of powerlines and their servicing has been identified as an additional threat through the slashing burning and spraying of pesticides that is required to gain maintenance access (4).\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0,With high levels of <strong>endemism</strong> and large numbers of threatened species the Blue Mountains home to the Blue Mountains water skink is a region of major conservation importance.\xa0Recognising this the Australian government has afforded this region extra protection beginning in 1959 with the creation of the Blue Mountains National Park and most recently the creation of the UNESCO Greater Blue Mountains World Heritage Area in 2000 (9) (10).\xa0
Animalia,Blue-eyed bush frog ,Animalia,Chordata,Amphibia,Anura,Rhacophoridae,Philautus (1),Male snout-vent length: 2.3 - 3 cm (2),The blue-eyed bush frog has lost a great amount of suitable habitat due to dam construction agriculture and urbanisation. Many of the remaining habitats are fragmented and ecological barriers prevent movement of individuals between the forest fragments (1) (2). The formation of fragmented habitats has left most populations of the blue-eyed bush frog at high risk of extinction due to <strong>inbreeding</strong> stress and has increased their vulnerability to invasive species. Any further reductions in habitat area could compromise the future survival of this species (2).,Some areas within the range of the blue-eyed bush frog are protected including the Sharavathi Valley Wildlife Sanctuary Mookambika Wildlife Sanctuary and Kudremukh National Park offering it a certain degree of protection. More research is required into the range habitat requirements and populations of the blue-eyed bush frog and investigations are needed into how threats can be addressed to conserve this colourful amphibian (1).\xa0
Animalia,Blue-headed quail-dove ,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Columbiformes,Columbidae,Starnoenas (1),c. 242 g (2),Excessive hunting and habitat destruction are the biggest threats to the blue-headed quail-dove (2) (3) (5). Less than 20 percent of Cuba\u2019s natural forests remain and the continued alteration and loss of this habitat is threatening much of Cuba\u2019s <strong>endemic</strong> wildlife (4) (5).,The blue-headed quail-dove is protected under Cuban national law in the Zapata Swamp. However the law is not currently enforced and hunting there continues to contribute significantly to this species\u2019 decline. The only known highland population of the blue-headed quail-dove is protected within the La G\xfcira National Park (3).
Animalia,Blue-legged mantella ,Animalia,Chordata,Amphibia,Anura,Mantellidae,Mantella (1),1 – 3 g (3),Several thousand blue-legged mantellas are thought to be collected every year from some regions in the Isalo Massif(3). Aside from over-collection the extremely small range of these critically endangered frogs is threatened with habitat loss as a result of grazing fires and sapphire mining operations (1).,Listing on Appendix II of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species provides the blue-legged mantella with some protection. It requires that an export licence is obtained for any trade in this species. A trade quota to prevent over-exploitation of this frog is crucial to its survival as even the protection offered by the Isalo National Park has not prevented the capture of the blue-legged mantella (1). Anyhow recent research showed that the species is still locally abundant (5).
Animalia,Blunt-nosed leopard lizard ,Animalia,Chordata,Reptilia,Squamata,Crotaphytidae,Gambelia (1),Male total length: up to 35.7 cm (2)Female total length: up to 33.4 cm (2)Male weight: up to 60 g (2)Female weight: up to 47g (2),The major threat to this species is the disturbance and destruction of its habitat for purposes such as cultivation and urbanisation (1) (5). Construction of facilities and dumping of waste related to gas and natural oil extraction has led directly to blunt-nosed leopard lizard mortalities (5).,The blunt-nosed leopard lizard is protected by law in the United States and is currently covered by the conservation efforts of the Endangered Species Recovery Program which aims to research and produce recoverey programmes for endangered species in the San Joaquin Valley (9). Efforts so far have included large-scale habitat and population surveys in order to better understand this elusive species (5). Future recommendations include determining appropriate habitat management and protecting additional habitat (5).
Animalia,Bluntnose shiner ,Animalia,Chordata,Actinopterygii,Cypriniformes,Cyprinidae,Notropis (1),Length: up to 10 cm (2),A study by the University of New Mexico showed that numbers of the bluntnose shiner had reduced significantly between 1939 and the 1990s (3). Several factors have contributed to this decline. Most importantly the construction of dams and reservoirs has blocked the upstream movements of the bluntnose shiner into formerly occupied habitats (5). Water degradation from agricultural pollutants has also reduced numbers (3).,The bluntnose shiner was listed as Threatened by the US federal government in 1987 facilitating the introduction of a five year research program to look at the measures necessary for the protection of the remaining populations (5).

Animalia,Boeseman's rainbowfish ,Animalia,Chordata,Actinopterygii,Atheriniformes,Melanotaeniidae,Melanotaenia (1),Length: up to 12 cm (2),The habitat of Boeseman\u2019s rainbowfish may regularly undergo wide fluctuations in water level but these are believed to have become more severe in recent years (1). The introduction of non-native fish to the lakes as a food source and for malaria control as well as the local use of poisons in fishing may also be affecting this species although the current impacts on the population are unknown (2). By far the biggest threat to Boeseman\u2019s rainbowfish however is from the overharvesting of individuals for the international aquarium fish trade. The beautiful colours of this species particularly the males have made it perhaps the most popular rainbowfish in the trade with an estimated one million individuals captured from the wild each year (1) (2) (3) (5).,The Indonesian government are reported to have restricted the trade in Boeseman\u2019s rainbowfish (5) but it is likely that careful controls in trade and further research into the species will be needed before its conservation status can be better known and its populations more effectively protected.

Animalia,Boulder star coral ,Animalia,Cnidaria,Anthozoa,Scleractinia,Faviidae,Montastraea (1),,Around one third of the world\u2019s reef-building corals are threatened with extinction (6). The principal threat to corals is the rise in sea temperature associated with global climate change. This leads to coral bleaching where the <strong>symbiotic</strong> <strong>algae</strong> are expelled leaving the corals weak and vulnerable to an increasing variety of harmful diseases. Climate change is also expected to increase ocean acidification and result in a greater frequency of extreme weather events such as destructive storms. This is not to mention the localised threats to coral reefs from pollution destructive fishing practices invasive species human development and other activities (1) (6).,In addition to being listed on Appendix II of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) which makes it an offence to trade <em>M. annularis</em> without a permit (2) this coral falls within several Marine Protected Areas across its range. To specifically conserve <em>M. annularis</em> recommendations have been made for a raft of studies into various aspects of its taxonomy biology and ecology including an assessment of threats and potential recovery techniques (1).

Animalia,Brown frog ,Animalia,Chordata,Amphibia,Anura,Ranidae,Rana (1),Male snout-vent length: 42 mm (2)Female snout-vent length: 52 mm (2),Currently this species is relatively common but its numbers are declining. It is primarily threatened by habitat loss due to agriculture and industry (11). Furthermore <em>Rana sauteri</em> is also potentially threatened by the chytrid fungus responsible for chytridiomycosis an emerging infectious disease which is detrimental to amphibian species (13).,<em>Rana sauteri</em> has not been recorded from any protected areas. Improved protection of its low-altitude forest habitat is required in order to conserve this species (1).
Animalia,Brownstriped grunt ,Animalia,Chordata,Actinopterygii,Perciformes,Haemulidae,Anisotremus (1),Max length: 18 cm (2),The primary threat to the brownstriped grunt is habitat degradation with recreational activities high sedimentation rates from runoff and pollution all contributing to a decline in the quality of this species\u2019 reef habitat (3). Although not of commercial importance (2) the brownstriped grunt is taken incidentally in other fisheries and is being increasingly caught for the marine aquarium trade (3).,There are currently no known conservation measures in place for the brownstriped grunt but specific recommendations have been made for the protection of its reef habitat through the designation of Marine Protected Areas and the regulation of its exploitation. In addition owing to the paucity of information available on this species further research into its ecology and population parameters is considered a high priority (3).

It is also likely to be affected by disturbance by humans and by the effects of groundwater depletion (1).,Cagle\u2019s map turtle is listed as Threatened in Texas and is therefore protected within the state (1) (5). It is also listed on Appendix III of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) meaning international trade in this species should be carefully regulated (3).

Sedimentation from mining activities is a prominent threat to this species as the excess sediment can smother the coral reduce nutrient availability and encourage <strong>algal</strong> growth (1).,All <em>Cantharellus</em> corals are listed on Appendix II of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) which means that trade in this and other <em>Cantharellus </em>species is regulated within countries that have agreed to the convention. Within these countries the trade of corals is only permissible for those with a permit to do so (2). Some <em>Cantharellus</em> corals inhabit areas which fall within marine protected areas or areas in which other management plans are in place to protect the coral community (1). In New Caledonia there are many established World Heritage Sites which help protect and manage roughly 60 percent of reefs within the surrounding waters (4).

The Fundao population of Carvalho\u2019s tree toad in particular is threatened by expanding coffee cultivation in this area (4).,Carvalho\u2019s tree toad is found in protected areas in the Caparao National Park and the Santa Teresa Biological Reserve (7). It may also occur in the Estacion Bi\xf3logica Santa Lucia and Reserva Bi\xf3logica Augusto Ruschi but this is not confirmed (1) (4).
Animalia,Caterpillar slug ,Animalia,Mollusca,Gastropoda,Stylommatophora,Veronicellidae,Laevicaulis (1),Extended length: up to 90 mm (2),The caterpillar slug is threatened by habitat loss and degradation as a result of ongoing urbanisation and development within its range. The original site of collection in a marsh near Durban has since been destroyed to make way for a road. These threats are exacerbated by the slug\u2019s already restricted range which makes it especially vulnerable to the effects of its changing environment (2).,Although there are currently no conservation measures directly targeting the caterpillar slug individuals have been observed in Hluhluwe Game Reserve where its habitat may receive some protection. Furthermore its appearance in suburban gardens in the Pietermaritzburg area suggests that this slug may be adaptable to a certain degree of habitat modification flexibility that would undoubtedly help its prospects of survival (2).

Animalia,Chatham Island oystercatcher ,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Charadriiformes,Haematopodidae,Haematopus (1),Length: 48 cm (2),Chatham Island oystercatchers are vulnerable to different threats due to the small size of their population (2). Population estimates in 1987 found numbers to be worryingly low; at just over 100 individuals (3). On Pitt and Chatham Islands introduced predators pose the major threat to the survival of this species. Sheep and cattle also cause problems by trampling on eggs and chicks (3). On Chatham Island introduced marram grass has spread onto the open areas where these oystercatchers prefer to nest forcing birds to nest too near to the waters edge where eggs are vulnerable to high tides (2).,In 1998 the New Zealand Department of Conservation began an intensive oystercatcher management programme (3). Methods used to enhance the survival of the species include: predator control the protection of nesting sites with fences and moving of nests away from the high tide mark (3). Efforts have been encouragingly successful and the population has increased significantly in the past 10 years (2).
Animalia,Chestnut-bellied flower-piercer ,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Thraupidae,Diglossa (1),Length: 14.5 cm (2),There are a number of threats to the habitat in the very small range of the chestnut-bellied flower-piercer including the expansion of human settlements extensive deforestation livestock grazing and intentional and accidental fires (6). However the chestnut-bellied flower-piercer is apparently able to tolerate some habitat degradation (6).,After a worrying 40 years of no records sightings of the chestnut-bellied flower-piercer since 2004 have given hope for the conservation of this endangered bird (3). The chestnut-bellied flower-piercer has been recorded from two protected areas Paramillo and Munchique National Parks (6) although the level of protection this actually offers is not clear. Increased support and enforcement of these two national parks has been recommended by BirdLife International in addition to further surveys to determine the population size and exact distribution of this species (6).

Animalia,Coastal stingaree ,Animalia,Chordata,Chondrichthyes,Rajiformes,Urolophidae,Urolophus (1),Disc size: up to 31 cm (2),Stingarees are rarely targeted by fisheries or sold commercially but large numbers are caught incidentally as <strong>bycatch</strong>. Because of their low birth rates slow reproductive turnover and sometimes restricted range stingarees are particularly susceptible to the damaging effects of over-fishing (4).,The coastal stingaree occurs in the Great Australian Bight Marine Park (GAB) within which exists a <strong>Benthic</strong> Protection Zone (BPZ) that affords some degree of protection to this bottom-dwelling species. However the Park\u2019s mission is not only to maintain current levels of biodiversity but also to provide ecologically sustainable use of marine resources. As such a number of fisheries and recreational fishing are still permitted to operate in certain areas and exploratory drilling for petroleum commenced in 2003 and further exploration activity is anticipated in the future (5). These activities may threaten the coastal stingaree and there are currently no conservation measures directly targeting the species.
Animalia,Cobitis ,Animalia,Chordata,Actinopterygii,Cypriniformes,Cobitidae,Cobitis (1),Maximum length: 8.1 cm (2),The distribution of <em>Cobitis turcica</em> can be split into five separate populations all of which are under threat and in decline. Drought and water pollution are the main threats while competition with introduced species including <em>Sander lucioperca</em> is also thought to be affecting this species. In total <em>Cobitis turcica</em> is thought to occupy an area no greater than 500 square kilometres (1).,<em>Cobitis turcica</em> has not been the target of any known conservation measures.
Animalia,Comanche Springs pupfish ,Animalia,Chordata,Actinopterygii,Cyprinodontiformes,Cyprinodontidae,Cyprinodon (1),Maximum length: 62mm (2),The small range of the Comanche Springs pupfish means that small changes in the environment can lead to drastic reductions in the overall population size. The main threat to this species is thought to be habitat loss which is occurring due to excessive groundwater pumping for agriculture (1). The Comanche Spring pupfish has become locally extinct in the spring where it was discovered due to groundwater extraction (1) and excessive water removal is still a problem in the area as much more water being removed than being replaced by rainfall (3). Other threats to this species include competition and <strong>hybridisation</strong> with non-native species such as the sheepshead minnow (<em>Cyprinodon variegatus</em>) (14). An especially large population of this <strong>invasive</strong> fish lives in Lake Balmorhea and the upstream dispersal of this population is proving to be detrimental to the Comanche Springs pupfish (15).,Current conservation efforts for this species are focussed on moderating water level fluctuations and removing <strong>invasive</strong> species (1). A man-made refugium and cienega were constructed in Balmorhea State Park in 1996 in an attempt to provide the Comanche Springs pupfish with a habitat that is not at risk of being drained (15). This wetland area has been located within the boundaries of the natural cienega in an effort to make it resemble and function similarly to the original habitat of this species (16). This conservation measure has proved to be a success and the area is now home to the world\u2019s largest Comanche Springs pupfish population. Additionally it is hoped that the removal of the <strong>invasive</strong> sheepshead minnow will help the Comanche Springs pupfish population to recover by eliminating unnatural competition (17).

Water is being extracted for agriculture drying out water bodies and leaving the Cretan frog without the necessary means to eat reproduce or live. The size of the habitat fragments are also decreasing due to new developments for the tourism industry as well as other infrastructure development (1).,The Cretan frog occurs in many protected areas although some of these are not currently well managed or protected correctly for conserving species.

Animalia,Ctenella coral ,Animalia,Cnidaria,Anthozoa,Scleractinia,Meandrinidae,Ctenella (1),,The major threat to one third of the world\u2019s reef-building corals is global climate change (8) with temperature extremes leading to coral bleaching. During bleaching the <strong>symbiotic</strong> <strong>algae</strong> are expelled resulting in weak and vulnerable corals that are susceptible to disease. Climate change may also increase the severity of <strong>El Ni\xf1o</strong> events and storms with strong waves and currents which destroy coral reefs. Greater levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere also cause increased ocean acidification which can reduce a coral\u2019s ability to create its hard skeleton. In addition rising sea levels may cause less sun to reach the coral thereby decreasing <strong>photosynthesis</strong> (1).,In addition to being listed on Appendix II of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) which makes it an offence to trade <em>Ctenella chagius</em> without a permit this coral falls within several Marine Protected Areas across its range. The recommended measures for preserving this species include more research into suitable habitats population numbers and the threats to the species as well as identifying establishing and managing new protected areas along with expanding existing protected areas. Disease also needs to be managed and controlled and it is further recommended that colonies should be artificially grown as an extra safety measure (1).

Animalia,Dingiso ,Animalia,Chordata,Mammalia,Diprotodontia,Macropodidae,Dendrolagus (1),6.5 – 14.5 kg (2),When Dr Tim Flannery discovered the dingiso in 1994 he gave it the scientific name <i>mbaiso</i> meaning \u2018forbidden animal\u2019 in the local Moni language. Although Moni tribesmen do not hunt the dingiso due to their belief that these are ancestral spirits it was hoped that this name would deter neighbouring people who do not hold these beliefs from hunting this <strong>marsupial</strong> (5).,At present there are no known conservation measures specifically in place for the dingiso. However conservation organisations are working to protect and preserve the remarkable wildlife of New Guinea such as WWF which aims to promote responsible forestry and improved protected area management (6). As the Indonesian government does not have abundant resources to deal with conservation issues it may be down to western nations to implement conservation initiatives for the dingiso and other fascinating tree kangaroos (4).

Animalia,Dwarf chameleon ,Animalia,Chordata,Reptilia,Squamata,Chamaeleonidae,Brookesia (1),0.5 g (2),There are few threats to the dwarf chameleon. There is very low commercial demand for this tiny chameleon and currently no legal export quota for this species exists<em>. </em>However the continued degradation of the dry forest in and around Tsingy de Bemaraha National Park is cause for concern because even small changes to forest structure might have a negative impact on this species (5).,The dwarf chameleon occurs in the Tsingy de Bemaraha National Park and probably also the Bemaraha Strict Nature Reserve (6) (7). Protected areas provide this species with some protection but do not completely eliminate the threats of illegal harvesting and habitat degradation as a result of fires cattle damage and timber exploitation (5) (7).\xa0The dwarf chameleon is also listed on Appendix II of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) meaning that trade in this species should be carefully controlled in order to be compatible with their survival (1).\xa0

Animalia,Erect-crested penguin ,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Sphenisciformes,Spheniscidae,Eudyptes (1),4 kg (3),Although still fairly abundant the erect-crested penguin is considered endangered because it is thought to have undergone significant declines of at least 50% over the last 45 years a pattern that is only expected to continue. Furthermore the species\u2019 very small and restricted breeding range leaves it particularly vulnerable (2). The reasons for this decline are not fully understood but are believed to be associated with marine factors as predation on land during the breeding season is unlikely to be significant since there are no mammalian predators on the Bounty or Antipodes Islands except for mice on the main Antipodes Island (2) (7).,All the islands on which the erect-crested penguin is found are nature reserves and as of 1998 became part a World Heritage site. Cattle and sheep were eradicated from Campbell Island in 1984 and 1992 respectively and introduced brown rats (<i>Rattus norvegicus</i>) have also been successfully removed from Campbell Island (2).

Animalia,Fabulous green sphinx moth ,Animalia,Arthropoda,Insecta,Lepidoptera,Sphingidae,Tinostoma (1),,The fabulous green sphinx moth resides on an island containing the highest diversity of threatened plants of all the Hawaiian Islands (1). The host plant of the fabulous green sphinx moth has not yet been identified but it is possible that it is as rare as the moth itself (1) (2). In 1992 Hurricane Iniki damaged large parts of forest on the moth\u2019s island and resulted in an increase in non-native invasive plant species which could have affected the host plant (1). The unknown host plant also faces destruction by <strong>feral</strong> animals such as pigs and goats which decimate native vegetation (1).,The fabulous green sphinx moth was thought to be extinct until astonishingly it was re-discovered in 1998 (1). It is now considered to be Endangered but unfortunately there are no protection measures in place to conserve it (1). Despite attempts to have it listed on the U.S. Endangered Species Act the lack of information about the fabulous green sphinx moth has so far prevented it from making the list (1).

Animalia,Forty-spotted pardalote ,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Pardalotidae,Pardalotus (1),10 g (3),The decline in white gum woodlands and forests as a result of historical land clearance for agriculture forestry and urban development is chiefly responsible for the reduced number and highly fragmented populations that occur today (2) (3). Since European colonisation over 50 percent of white gum forest in the south east region of Tasmania has been cleared and on private land clearing still continues. The impact of woodland fragmentation on the forty-spotted pardalote is particularly damaging as the bird is not capable of long-distance dispersal and thus colonies quickly become isolated from each other (3). Wildfires which kill canopy trees and restrict regeneration of young trees pose an additional threat and it is feared that fires that swept through Flinders Island in 2002 may have severely damaged the remaining colonies found there (2) (3). Aside from habitat loss there is concern that aggressive birds such as the noisy miner (<i>Manorina melanocephala</i>) are invading forty-spotted pardalote habitat where it has been opened up by disturbance and clearance and subsequently are outcompeting this species for resources (3).,The preservation of white gum woodlands and forests is critical to the survival of the forty-spotted pardalote (3). Fortunately around 60 percent of the habitat currently occupied is protected within reserves including the most significant breeding colony on Bruny Island (2). A recovery plan which ran from 1991 to 1997 was instrumental in increasing the amount of protected habitat as well as in locating new colonies planting white gum seedlings to create new habitat and raising public awareness. The current stability of the forty-pardalote population at around 3800 birds in 2008 is evidence of the success of the original recovery plan but because it still has a very small and fragmented range the species remains classified as Endangered on the IUCN Red List (1) (2) (3). A new four-year recovery plan implemented in 2006 has the central aim of improving the conservation status of the forty-spotted pardalote sufficiently to warrant it being down-listed to Vulnerable. In order to achieve this the plan intends to enhance and expand existing habitat to assist in the colonisation of potential habitat and to conduct research that will help to identify and respond to threats restricting the current population (3).

Animalia,Four-eyed turtle ,Animalia,Chordata,Reptilia,Testudines,Bataguridae,Sacalia (1),Carapace length: up to 14.5 cm (2),Like many other freshwater turtles the largely uncontrolled and devastating trade for food and traditional medicine in many parts of Asia poses the greatest threat to the four-eyed turtle (1) (6).  The fairly small populations in Lao PDR and Vietnam are not considered as threatened as the main population in China where it is at risk of extinction (1) probably due to the fact that China is the major consumer of freshwater turtles (7).,Despite many turtle species being protected by a listing on the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) and China\u2019s Wild Animals Protection Law freshwater turtles are still found in restaurants and food markets.  Raised conservation awareness and more effective law enforcement is required if the four-eyed turtle and other freshwater turtles are to survive (7).

Animalia,Freshwater pearl mussel ,Animalia,Mollusca,Bivalvia,Unionoida,Margaritiferidae,Margaritifera (1),Length: 12 – 15 cm (2),Once the most abundant <strong>bivalve mollusc</strong> in ancient rivers around the world numbers of the freshwater pearl mussel are now declining in all countries and this species is nearly extinct in many areas (4).  The causes of this decline are not fully understood but alteration and degradation of its freshwater habitat undoubtedly plays a central role (4).  The negative impacts humans have on rivers and streams come from a wide range of activities such as river regulation drainage sewage disposal dredging and water pollution including the introduction of excess nutrients (4).  Anything that affects the abundance of the fish hosts will also affect the freshwater pearl mussel; for example the introduction of exotic fish species such as the rainbow trout reduces the number of native fish hosts (4).  Introduced species are also directly affecting the freshwater pearl mussel; the invasion of the zebra mussel (<i>Dreissena polymorpha</i>) which has been spread to new locations by being transported on the bottom of boats or in ballast waters has impacted freshwater pearl mussel populations in all countries it has invaded (4).,The freshwater pearl mussel which is completely protected in most European countries (8) has been the focus of a significant amount of conservation efforts (9).  Measures have included the transfer of adult mussels to areas where it had gone extinct (9) (10) the culture of juvenile mussels and the release of juvenile trout which have been infected with glochidia into small rivers (10) but mainly the freshwater pearl mussel has benefited from habitat restoration projects in some areas (10).  Due to the essential role salmonid fish play in the life of the freshwater pearl mussel the conservation of salmon and trout is also central in the survival of this endangered freshwater mussel (4).
Animalia,Freshwater white-clawed crayfish ,Animalia,Arthropoda,Crustacea,Decapoda,Astacidae,Austropotamobius (1),Length: up to 12 cm (usually less than 10 cm) (2),Perhaps the most devastating factor affecting freshwater white-clawed crayfish at present is crayfish plague a virulent fungal disease carried by the aggressive introduced species the American signal crayfish (<i>Pacifastacus leniusculus</i>) (4). Spores of this disease can be spread in the water on wet equipment and on fish (2). Competition with introduced crayfish species has also affected our native crayfish (3); signal crayfish were first introduced to the UK in the 1970s and are now naturalised and breeding (2). Two other introduced species have become established (3); the narrow-clawed (or Turkish) crayfish (<i>Astacus leptodactylus</i>) and the noble crayfish (<i>Astacus astacus</i>) (2). Pollution and river works are also likely to have affected the species (2).,The freshwater white-clawed crayfish has been targeted as a priority for conservation under the UK Biodiversity Action Plan (UK BAP). The Species Action Plan aims to maintain the current distribution of the species through a combination of restricting the spread of non-native crayfish and crayfish plague as well as providing suitable habitat features (3). The Environment Agency has carried out research into potential methods of controlling the signal crayfish and is currently investigating the use of pheromones to lure this introduced species into traps (5). It is an offence under Schedule 9 of the Wildlife and Countryside Act to release the three introduced species of crayfish into the wild (3).

Animalia,Galapagos land snail ,Animalia,Mollusca,Gastropoda,Stylommatophora,Bulimulidae,Bulimulus (1),,Since their colonisation the Galapagos Islands have experienced a dramatic decline of suitable habitat for land snails as farming road and house construction and eventually tourism grew (1) (2) (3). Both San Crist\xf3bal and Floreana have been badly affected and each now has more than five bulimulid species categorized as Critically Endangered or Endangered on the IUCN Red List as well as several previously recorded species that are now extinct (3). Grazing livestock (goats pigs) and invasive alien plants have also altered the snail\u2019s habitat (3) and occasionally the islands have suffered from uncontrolled fires destroying habitat and snails alike (2). Additionally introduced predators such as black rats (<i>Rattus rattus</i>) and little fire ants (<i>Wasmania auropunctata</i>) have had a direct impact on land snail populations by feeding on them and destroying their eggs (2). Established populations of the invasive little fire ant are known to exist on San Crist\xf3bal and Floreana (1).,There are currently no conservation measures targeting this species.

Animalia,Galapagos penguin ,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Sphenisciformes,Spheniscidae,Spheniscus (1),Length: 53 cm (2),The main threat facing this unique penguin is the increasing frequency of ENSO events which reduce the strength of the cool currents this species needs to survive and causes fluctuations in its prey (6). The 1982-1983 ENSO resulted in the catastrophic loss of 77 percent of the Galapagos penguin population through starvation. A slow period of recovery followed but the 1997-1998 ENSO resulted in another precipitous population crash of 66 percent. Such events may have a disproportionate affect on females which can skew the sex ratio and make recovery from population crashes even slower (2). Furthermore during periods of food shortages the Galapagos penguin forages individually and makes no attempt to breed until sea temperatures decrease once again (4).\xa0,All populations of the Galapagos penguin occur within the Galapagos National Park and Marine Reserve. At present all populations are closely monitored and feral animals are controlled (2).\xa0

Animalia,Giant freshwater crayfish ,Animalia,Arthropoda,Crustacea,Decapoda,Parastacidae,Astacopsis (1),2 – 3 kg (2),The major threat to this species has been over-fishing since these crayfish are a popular food dish but this has not been sustainable due to extremely slow maturation and infrequent breeding (5). Habitat loss is also a threat as a result of increasing agricultural expansion forestry operations and changes in water quality (3). In-stream barriers have reduced the dispersal potential of the crayfish and erosion following agricultural expansion has caused silty water which is less favourable for the giant freshwater crayfish (4).,The decline of giant freshwater crayfish numbers following intense resulted in a fishing ban in January 1998 although an ongoing commitment is needed in order for the crayfish to recover from its endangered status. Population surveys and behavioural research are being undertaken in order to be able to provide better habitat protection and improved management of riverbank vegetation (3).
Animalia,Giant golden mole ,Animalia,Chordata,Mammalia,Afrosoricida,Chrysochloridae,Chrysospalax (1),410 - 500 g (2),The main threat to the giant golden mole is habitat loss. The fact that it requires such a specific habitat has left it vulnerable to human-inflicted habitat degradation and fragmentation. Commercial forestry plantations have replaced large areas of <strong>indigenous</strong> forest and firewood collection bark stripping the cutting of saplings for hut construction and overgrazing by livestock have also caused a dramatic reduction in available habitat (5).,The fate of the giant golden mole remains uncertain as although it may occur in a few protected reserves there are currently no targeted conservation actions underway to protect this species. Research is needed in order to assess the status and viability of the remaining populations (1).
Animalia,Giant kangaroo rat ,Animalia,Chordata,Mammalia,Rodentia,Heteromyidae,Dipodomys (1),Total length: 31.2 - 34.8 cm (2)Tail length: 15.7 - 19.4 cm (2)Average male weight: 157g (3)Average female weight: 151g (3),Population numbers of the giant kangaroo rat plummeted during the 20th Century (1) mainly as a result of habitat loss as desert areas were converted to agriculture (7). Over 95 percent of the former range of this species has been lost due to a combination of overgrazing cultivation mining operations and the introduction exotic plants (1).,The giant kangaroo rat\xa0is listed as Endangered by the California Fish and Game Commission and the United States Fish and Wildlife Service (1). A Recovery Plan has been developed in an effort to secure the future survival of this species (8) and populations are protected within the Carrizo Plan Natural Heritage Reserve and a number of Federal lands (1).

All previously known populations in Algeria are now extinct due to heavy stream pollution although no recent surveys in new areas have been undertaken. The impact of habitat loss and degradation is expected to continue in the future due to expanding human populations across this species\u2019 range a growing tourism industry in Tunisia and Morocco and global climatic changes (1).,There are currently no known conservation initiatives targeting the glittering demoiselle but there is an urgent need for control of water use in terms of both quantity and quality (1).

This is due to deforestation for grazing and agriculture particularly coffee and illegal coca and gradual urban development (4) (5). Elfin forests are also at risk from fires spreading from adjacent grasslands (4). This species is extremely vulnerable to any habitat loss due to its range already being very restricted.,Golden-backed mountain-tanagers occur within the Rio Abiseo National Park which is also a UNESCO World Heritage Site which offers a number of tanagers a degree of protection (4).

Animalia,Golden-cheeked warbler ,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Parulidae,Dendroica (1),7 - 15 g (2),The main threat to the golden-cheeked warbler is habitat loss with much of its breeding habitat having been cleared for development agriculture and reservoir construction (2) (3) (4) (6) (8) and the winter habitat also under threat from logging burning firewood-cutting mineral extraction and clearance for cattle and agriculture (2) (4) (8) (9) (10). The species\u2019 rather restricted habitat requirements and small breeding range make it particularly vulnerable to habitat loss (4) (10) and ongoing fragmentation of the remaining habitat also creates further problems by isolating populations and so reducing <strong>gene flow</strong> between them potentially leading to a loss of genetic diversity. It also decreases nesting success at forest edges and potentially increases predation as well as <strong>brood parasitism</strong> by the brown-headed cowbird (<i>Molothrus ater</i>) (2) (3) (4) (6). In addition habitat disturbance may decrease juniper-oak regeneration through disease and increased browsing pressure and the woodlands may take decades to recover from disturbance if at all (2) (7). Where juniper has instead spread often due to fire suppression and overgrazing it generally lacks the hardwood trees that the golden-cheeked warbler also requires (6).,In 1990 the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service listed the golden-cheeked warbler as Endangered (5) and the species is also listed as Endangered by the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department (12). A recovery plan put in place in the United States in 1992 called for the protection of sufficient breeding and non-breeding habitat the allowance of <strong>gene flow</strong> between warbler populations and the protection and management of all existing populations on public land (8). The golden-cheeked warbler occurs in a number of protected areas throughout its range including Balcones Canyonlands National Wildlife Refuge in Texas and various conservation efforts including habitat restoration and voluntary cowbird trapping are underway in many areas (2) (3) (4) (6) (8).\xa0

Animalia,Goliath frog ,Animalia,Chordata,Amphibia,Anura,Ranidae,Conraura (1),3.3 kg (2),Much of the dense rainforest of the goliath frog's habitat has been deforested for timber and to make way for agriculture. The construction of dams also threatens the breeding habitat of these frogs and this species is particularly vulnerable to habitat alteration due to its highly restricted range (2). Additionally goliath frogs are considered a delicacy and are collected by local people for food (3); their large size has also encouraged collection for the pet trade in the past (2).,The goliath frog is not currently protected under any trade restrictions and collection continues to threaten remaining populations. Captive breeding programmes have not proven successful and the only method of effectively preserving this amphibious giant is to safeguard areas of remaining habitat (2).

Animalia,Grass-loving lizard ,Animalia,Chordata,Reptilia,Squamata,Lacertidae,Philochortus (1),Snout-vent length: up to 7.3 cm (2),The main threat to the grass-loving lizard is the loss of its very specific habitat due to agriculture and overgrazing (1). In Egypt suitable habitat is declining in both area and quality and this is also presumed to be the case in Libya. The rarity of the grass-loving lizard is also making it more attractive to animal collectors and declines in its population can be partly attributed to collection for the pet trade as well as for scientific research (1) (2).,The grass-loving lizard does not currently occur in any protected areas so there is an urgent need to protect its habitat and to develop community-based protection measures (1) (2). An estimated one to five square kilometres of suitable habitat has been identified in Egypt suggesting that there is hope for conservation efforts to protect the habitat there. Without any action the grass-loving lizard is in imminent danger of extinction (3).
Animalia,Greater adjutant ,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Ciconiiformes,Ciconiidae,Leptoptilos (1),Length: 145 – 150 cm (2),Loss of nesting habitat and feeding sites has had a huge impact on this stork species. Suitable wetland habitats have been cleared drained polluted with pesticides and disturbed by humans. Adult birds are hunted and chicks and eggs are collected for trade (3).,Whilst legally protected in India Bangladesh Burma Thailand Cambodia and Laos and occurring in three National Parks in Assam India the greater adjutant still suffers from hunting and egg collection due to poor enforcement of protection. There has been some successful control of egg and chick collection following efforts by the Wildlife Protection Office Staff in Cambodia which resulted in higher numbers of storks the following year. It has been proposed that the greater adjutant should be moved from Schedule IV to Schedule I of the Indian Wildlife Act of 1972 to give it greater priority. Effective land management is necessary for the survival of this species particularly the control of pesticide use around feeding areas and the protection of feeding areas and nesting sites found outside protected areas. Further research into the seasonal movements of these birds and the threats that face them is also important (3).
Animalia,Greater big-footed mouse ,Animalia,Chordata,Mammalia,Rodentia,Muridae,Macrotarsomys (1),50 – 60 g (2),The greater big-footed mouse is very vulnerable to any threats due to its very restricted distribution.  The dry deciduous forests of Madagascar are threatened by burning to clear land for agriculture and grazing selective logging and expanding rural human populations (5).  Such habitat destruction and degradation will inevitably impact heavily on the greater big-footed mouse.,The greater big-footed mouse occurs within the Ankarafantsika National Park.  Unfortunately this area still faces the threat of frequent fires during the dry season and encroachment by grazing cattle but international conservation organisations are working to improve the protection of the reserve (6).
Animalia,Greek goldenring ,Animalia,Arthropoda,Insecta,Odonata,Cordulegastridae,Cordulegaster (1),Male length: 68 - 78 mm (2)Female length: 78-83 mm (2)Male length of abdomen: 50 - 60 mm (2)Female length of abdomen: 59 - 63 mm (2)Male hindwing: 41 - 46 mm (2)Female hindwing: 46 - 49 mm (2),Populations of the Greek goldenring appear to be severely fragmented and some previously reported sites have recently been found dry and deserted as a result of water extraction for human use. Thus the population is believed to be declining due to habitat destruction caused at least in part by water harnessing by humans (1).,No conservation measures currently target the Greek goldenring but there is a need for control of water use and forest preservation (1).
Animalia,Green mantella ,Animalia,Chordata,Amphibia,Anura,Mantellidae,Mantella (1),Male length: 22 – 25 mm (2)Female length: 25 – 30 mm (2),Having suffered over-collection for the pet trade in the past populations of green mantellas are now most threatened by habitat degradation. The green mantella is still locally abundant but it exists in a very small range and so is at risk of extinction if its habitat is not protected from the fires selective logging firewood collection and livestock grazing that currently threaten it. Too much forest loss will have cumulative effects as the streams could dry out (1).,Trade regulations have successfully reduced collection of this species but trade must continue to be carefully controlled to ensure its survival. It does not occur in any protected areas but it is sometimes bred in captivity (1).

Animalia,Grey-crowned crocias ,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Timaliidae,Crocias (1),Length: 22 cm (2),Prior to its re-discovery in 1994 the grey-crowned crocias had not been seen in over 50 years. Since 1994 it has been observed with increasing frequency albeit at the same few sites (3). However given its very small range and the constant threat of habitat loss this species remains at a very high risk of extinction. Forest degradation caused by logging clearance of land for agriculture fuel-wood collection and charcoal production threatens all the known sites for this species. Furthermore an increase in the size of the human population in the region of the Da Lat plateau attributable to a governmnet resettlement programme is putting even further pressure on the remaining forest habitat (2) (3).,While the only site at which the grey-crowned crocias is relatively common Chu Yang Sin Nature Reserve is ostensibly protected no protection measures actually exist and its boundaries have not been decided. Fortunately compared with other areas of the Da Lat plateau the Chu Yang Sin Nature Reserve is under much less pressure from degradation due to its remoteness. Nonetheless it is still a priority to develop management activities within the reserve and to ensure the reserve\u2019s effective protection together with other areas of broadleaved evergreen forest on the Da Lat plateau (2) (3).

Animalia,Gyraulus ,Animalia,Mollusca,Gastropoda,Hygrophila,Planorbidae,Gyraulus (1),Shell diameter: up to 7 mm (2) (3),A restricted range species <em>Gyraulus crenophilus</em> is vulnerable to alterations to its habitat (1). A number of pollutants are currently entering the streams and lake where <em>Gyraulus crenophilus</em> is present including sewage from nearby cities agricultural contaminants and an increasing amount of sediment due to deforestation in the catchment area of these water bodies. Over-extraction of water is also having a negative impact on this species in some parts of its range (1).,There are currently no known conservation measures in place for <em>Gyraulus crenophilus</em> although monitoring and careful habitat management are suggested actions to conserve this rare snail (1).

Animalia,Hawaii creeper ,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Drepanididae,Oreomystis (1),Length: 11 cm (2),Habitat loss and degradation are present on Hawaii Island but since the Hawaii creeper is known to reproduce despite the disturbance this is not thought to be the major threat to this species. Hawaii has been subjected to a high numbers of species introductions which have had wide-ranging ecological effects. Feral pigs degrade native forests enabling the spread of alien plant species and disease-carrying mosquitoes. The mosquitoes carry pox and malaria which caused epidemics amongst birds in 1992 reducing populations significantly including the Hawaii creeper. Compounding these declines introduced rodents predate heavily on Hawaii creeper eggs reducing breeding success (2).,Honeycreeper habitat has been protected by the creation of the Hakalau Forest National Wildlife Refuge and the Hawaiian creeper is also found in the Hawaii Volcanoes National park where feral goats are actively excluded. The feral pig population has been tackled by Hawaiian conservation authorities and private landowners and cattle have been removed from some reserves. Planting of koa trees began in the early 1990s and research into the possibility of aerial release of rodenticides is being undertaken. Captive breeding is not taking place but is possible if thought to be necessary at a later stage (2).
Animalia,Hawaiian tree snail ,Animalia,Mollusca,Gastropoda,Stylommatophora,Achatinellidae,Partulina (1),,As a result of human disturbances the Hawaiian Islands have seen devastating extinction rates and today over half of the described tree snails are thought to be extinct (7). Having suffered from habitat loss the Hawaiian tree snail is now restricted to just a single location with a population of less than 1000 individuals (5). This species first came under threat when the first settlers on the Hawaiian Islands began logging the lowland forests replacing natural habitats with agricultural lands and cattle ranches. These destructive activities were compounded by the introduction of non-native predators such as rats and the predatory snail <em>Euglandina rosea</em> and alien plant species which overgrow native plant seedlings limiting natural forest regeneration (2). As a result the Hawaiian tree snail listed as a Species of Concern by the United States Fisheries and Wildlife Service is under severe threat of extinction (8). The survival of this species is also hindered by its slow reproduction rate and the degradation of its habitat by feral pigs and goats (5) (6). \xa0,Like many other Hawaiian snail species the restricted geographic range and small population size of the Hawaiian tree snail makes it vulnerable to habitat degradation and consequently its survival may be dependant upon conservation measures (6). Fortunately for this species efforts are underway to protect its fragile habitat. In 2003 the Ponoholo Ranch which encompasses the Hawaiian tree snail\u2019s habitat entered the Kohala Watershed Partnership which resulted in fencing being built along three sides of the ranch to exclude wild cattle while plans were made to cull wild pigs and remove invasive weeds. The Nature Conservancy has also agreed a 15-year management plan with the ranch with the development of a management plan for the Hawaiian tree snail a key priority (4). This vulnerable species is also benefiting from a captive breeding facility coordinated by the University of Hawaii on Lanai (5). With the successful implementation of these measures and further efforts to remove predators and limit habitat loss there is significant hope that the future of the Endangered Hawaiian tree snail will be secured (1).

Animalia,Henderson petrel ,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Procellariiformes,Procellariidae,Pterodroma (1),Length: 36 - 37 cm (2) (3),The Henderson petrel is undergoing a long-term decline on Henderson Island as a result of chick predation by introduced Polynesian rats (<em>R. exulans</em>) (2) (6) (7) (8) which have been estimated to kill 25000 petrel chicks on the island each year (9). If this species ever bred on Pitcairn Island its disappearance there is also likely to have been caused by introduced rats and cats (2) and it has not been confirmed to breed on Ducie Island since 1922 (3) probably for the same reasons. However other than for rats and a few introduced plants the ecology of Henderson Island is still remarkably intact with little human impact because of the island\u2019s remote location and rough terrain. Although Pitcairn Islanders travel to the island to cut wood this has little impact at current levels and a potentially damaging attempt by a millionaire to build a house airstrip and cattle ranch on the island in the 1980s was denied permission. Any increase in tourist visitors to this uninhabited island may be of concern as it could increase the risk of environmental damage and the accidental introduction of further mammalian predators (10) (11) (12).,Although rat and cat eradication attempts on Pitcairn Island have not yet been successful rats have been successfully eliminated from Ducie and Oeno raising the chances of the Henderson petrel becoming established on these islands in the future (2) (3). Although rat eradication on Henderson Island is made more difficult by its remote location (2) it will be vital if the decline of the Henderson petrel is to be halted. Fortunately recent research has addressed potential obstacles to an eradication programme and rat eradication is planned to start in 2011 subject to sufficient funding (9) (13).

Animalia,Indian yellow-nosed albatross ,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Procellariiformes,Diomedeidae,Thalassarche (1),2.55 kg (3),As with many seabird species longline fishing activities pose the major threat to the Indian yellow-nosed albatross. Longlining is mainly used to catch tuna and swordfish by releasing a line of baited hooks that sink to the appropriate depth for these fish. Many seabirds dive for the bait before it has sunk becoming caught on the hooks and drowning as the line reaches its final depth (2).,Prince Edward Island is a Special Nature Reserve where all fauna is protected. Population monitoring and foraging studies have been carried out on Amsterdam Island and vaccines against the bacterial diseases have been tested but these cannot be carried out on a large scale (2). A Threat Abatement Plan has been prepared which proposes to reduce <strong>by-catch</strong> in all fisheries within the species\u2019 range (5).

It is unclear whether it currently occurs in any protected areas but suitable habitat needs to be protected if its survival is to be ensured (1).

Animalia,Italian nase ,Animalia,Chordata,Actinopterygii,Cypriniformes,Cyprinidae,Chondrostoma (1),up to 1 kg (3),Pollution and the extraction of river waters mainly due to agricultural activities are posing a serious threat to the survival of this fish as is the introduction of some non-<strong>endemic</strong> species including the wels catfish (<em>Silurus glanis</em><em>)</em> the common nase (<em>Chondrostoma nasus</em><em>) </em>and the common roach (<em>Rutilus rutilus</em>) (1). These species are generally introduced for sport-fishing a popular activity with Italian people (3).,The Italian nase is protected in Europe under Appendix III of the Convention on the Conservation of European Wildlife and Natural Habitats (also known as the Bern Convention) (5). Restoration projects are being discussed in Italy which would recreate suitable zones in rivers and lakes in which freshwater fishes could live. \xa0Creating \u2018safe passages\u2019 so that the Italian nase can migrate easily between lakes and spawning sites avoiding any dams or other barriers would be a solution to the problem of population fragmentation (6).
Animalia,Jamaican blackbird ,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Icteridae,Nesospar (1),Length: 18 cm (2),The past and current major threat to the Jamaican blackbird is habitat destruction as a result of afforestation with Caribbean pine (<i>Pinus caribaea</i>) and clearance for the creation of coffee plantations. Trees are also removed for making charcoal and small-scale farming and development is a constant threat to the area of habitat that remains. This bird species is particularly threatened by the removal of large trees as these are the support for the bromeliads and <strong>epiphytes</strong> that the blackbird forages amongst. Their removal also makes space for the invasive species wild coffee (<i>Pittosporum undulatum</i>) which prevents the growth of epiphytes and therefore further hinders the Jamaican blackbird (2) (4).,A network of reserves and national parks exists across Jamaica and whilst the Jamaican blackbird is found in several of these including the largest which spans 800 km\xb2 of the Blue and John Crow Mountains they are poorly managed and protected and their long-term future is not secure. The conservation of Cockpit Country would be of great benefit to the species and consequently funding is being sought to create a reserve there (2).
Animalia,Jocotoco antpitta ,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Formicariidae,Grallaria (1),Length: 22 cm (2),Quebrada Honda is close to a road and the area is threatened by gold mining and logging even within Podocarpus National Park. Habitat loss caused by farming and human settlement is also a problem (2). Sadly this rare bird also faces the occasional threat of collection for museums; in 2006 scientists from Louisiana Museum captured and killed two out of three specimens of the Jocotoco antpitta recently discovered in northern Peru (5).,The discovery of this antpitta led to the establishment of <i>Fundacion Jocotoco</i> which initiated efforts to protect the locality at which the species was first discovered; to this end the Tapichalaca Reserve was set up at the site (6). In September 2003 the Christopher Parsons Memorial Forest adjacent to the Tapichalaca Reserve was purchased with the help of the World Land Trust following an appeal launched by Sir David Attenborough. Christopher Parsons was described by Sir Attenborough as the most important natural history film maker of the last century. His last project before his death in 2002 was the development of ARKive. He was a trustee of the World Land Trust and the reserve is a fitting memorial to his life\u2019s passion (7).
Animalia,Jollyville Plateau salamander ,Animalia,Chordata,Amphibia,Caudata,Plethodontidae,Eurycea (1),Length: 5.5 cm (2),The major threat that the Jollyville Plateau salamander faces is urbanisation which is expanding rapidly in Austin Texas (2) (4) (5). The abundance of this salamander has been found to decrease as the degree of urbanisation increases (2) (4). One site that the Jollyville Plateau salamander inhabits has been affected by building work resulting in increased levels of nitrate (4). This has coincided with an increase in recordings of spinal deformities in the Jollyville Plateau salamander population (2). This species is also likely to be affected by other forms of pollution including from chlorinated water from swimming pools (3) (4). In addition to pollution the habitat of the Jollyville Plateau salamander is being degraded by altered water flow (3) (5) including increased flow rates due to discharges from urban areas which can wash away the salamanders or the cover upon which they depend (3). As they are small and localised the freshwater springs this species inhabits are also susceptible to drying and drainage (2).,As the Jollyville Plateau salamander has only recently been discovered there is little information of its historical abundance. Studies are being conducted into the relationship between salamander abundance and distribution and habitat and water quality in order to devise policies for their protection (5). Long-term monitoring of water quality and continued surveys of this species have also been recommended (4).

Animalia,Knysna seahorse ,Animalia,Chordata,Actinopterygii,Syngnathiformes,Syngnathidae,Hippocampus (1),Length: 5.3 - 11.2 cm (2),The highly restricted range and fragmented population of this species make the Knysna seahorse particularly vulnerable to exploitation and habitat damage (1). The 'garden route' area of South Africa is becoming increasingly developed and this is having a detrimental effect on the population (6). This species is the only seahorse that has so far been identified to be primarily at risk from habitat damage (5).,The Knysna seahorse is protected in South Africa and may only be collected with a permit (3). Further research into population distribution and the behaviour of the species is urgently needed before an effective conservation action plan can be implemented.
Animalia,Kokako ,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Callaeidae,Callaeas (1),Length: 38 – 50 cm (2) (3),The combination of deforestation and the introduction of <strong>invasive</strong> mammalian predators in two waves of human colonisation since 1270 AD nearly extirpated this species.  Just one quarter of the forest present 1000 years ago is still standing. European settlers brought with them ship rats brush-tail possums stoats and wild cats (1) (2) (4) which prey heavily on young and female kokakos at the nest leaving an excess of males who are not able to breed. These males sometimes pair up and nest with each other in the absence of female partners (9). Whilst in 1999 the North Island kokako population stood at 1160 birds only 396 of these were female thus limiting the number of reproducing pairs (10).,Intensive recovery planning and management since the mid 1980s has substantially recovered North Island kokako populations.  In 2007 there were 18 increasing populations totalling 850 pairs.  Such intensive management is vital as nearly all unmanaged populations are now extinct.  <strong>Translocations</strong> have established populations on four offshore islands and restored kokako to three sites in their original range (Wairarapa Hawkes Bay and East Cape) and further <strong>translocations</strong> are planned as part of widespread active restoration of mainland New Zealand forest ecosystems.  The recovery of the kokako requires intensive control of introduced mammal pests particularly ship rats and brushtail possums (9).  Some populations are now managed by pulsed control effort a method in which pest control has \u2018on\u2019 and \u2018off\u2019 years.  This effectively controls pest populations whilst minimising the input of pest control poisons at any site and means that conservation resources can be spent on other sites or problems during the \u2018off\u2019 years (11).

Animalia,Kubusi stream damsel ,Animalia,Arthropoda,Insecta,Odonata,Platycnemididae,Metacnemis (1),,This endangered damselfly has disappeared from some of its former range and is now known from only two sites which are unprotected and experiencing ongoing habitat loss and degradation (1). Habitat loss is principally the result of cattle farming but additional threats include alien invasive trees (particularly black wattle <i>Acacia mearnsii</i>) shading out the habitat pollution of the Kabusi River from domestic washing and siltation of the stream from cattle trampling the banks (1). Predation by introduced rainbow trout may also pose a threat (1).,A massive national rehabilitation scheme (Working with Water Programme) began in 1995 with the aim of eradicating invasive alien plants in South Africa. The programme has been a fantastic success story with other dragonflies and damselflies (e.g. harlequin sprite <i>Pseudagrion newtoni</i>) that were presumed to be extinct being rediscovered along river stretches where invasive alien trees were removed and the natural vegetation re-established (3). Thus continued work by the Working with Water Programme in the removal of alien plants could also help the Kubusi stream damsel recover in a similar way (4). A further important conservation measure advocated is the translocation of this species to a protected area where it could find safe refuge from the damaging impacts of pollution and cattle farming (1).

Animalia,Leadbeater’s possum ,Animalia,Chordata,Mammalia,Diprodontia,Petauridae,Gymnobelideus (1),100 – 170 g (2),Leadbeater\u2019s possum is heavily dependent on old mountain ash trees for nesting sites and these trees are threatened by timber operations and wildfire (1). Deforestation is followed by burning and reseeding but these young trees will not make suitable nest sites for another 150 years (5).,Already endangered this species cannot fully recover for 50 \u2013 100 years as the old trees that are crucial to its lifestyle are currently too young. Populations in sub-optimum older-aged and mixed-aged forest are less dense than populations in optimal habitat but older forests are thought to be less at risk from wildfires (3). Therefore a management plan is in place that involves protecting both optimum and sub-optimum habitat with a nature reserve system as well as an alternative logging system that preserves high quality habitat (3). Experiments with the introduction of nest boxes have been partially successful with 13 out of 96 nest boxes now occupied by Leadbeater\u2019s possum (7).

In Victoria about half of the range of the long-footed potoroo occurs in State Forest which is used for multiple purposes including intensive logging. In such landscapes logging prescriptions have been modified to lessen the impact on potoroos including higher degrees of habitat retention. In New South Wales nearly all known habitat for the species occurs in National Park (6). Wildfires and periodic fuel-reduction burning have a largely unknown effect on the species and the fungi on which the potoroo depends for food although in the short term loss of ground cover due to fire may be detrimental to survival (3). The long-footed potoroo occurs in small highly isolated populations so genetic problems resulting from inbreeding are a possibility. Moreover small populations are at great risk of extinction caused by chance events such as fire drought or disease (3).,Information on this elusive rare species is sparse and so further studies into habitat selection breeding dispersal diet and the threats affecting this species are needed in order to effectively conserve it (5). A small breeding captive population was held at Healesville Sanctuary through the 1980s and 1990s which allowed research on the behaviour and reproduction of the species otherwise difficult to observe in the wild (3). The ongoing status of the captive colony is unclear as the last remaining animal died recently (6). In Victoria on State Forest tenure the species is protected in a series of Special Management Areas in which logging is either prevented or monitored and controlled burning reduced (2) (6). Wild dog and red fox control is undertaken to varying degrees across much of the range of the long-footed potoroo. Feral cat control is undertaken on a more limited basis (3). Special Management Areas for long-footed potoroos in Victoria will benefit a wide range of other native species including the marsupial carnivore the spotted-tailed quoll (<i>Dasyurus maculatus</i>) which is also threatened (3).

Animalia,Madagascar sacred ibis ,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Ciconiiformes,Threskiornithidae,Threskiornis (1),Length: 65 – 89 cm (2),The main threats to the Madagascar sacred ibis come from the harvesting of its eggs the trapping of adults and the taking of chicks for human consumption. Estimates of this species\u2019 population on Madagascar in 2006 indicated that there were less than 2000 mature individuals a number that is simply too small to support the current levels of exploitation. Unfortunately the Madagascar sacred ibis displays no fear of humans while nesting or roosting and is therefore an easily obtainable source of food for hunters. While legislation on hunting does exist in Madagascar it has proved ineffective in reducing hunting pressure on this species with surveys indicating that populations of the Madagascar sacred ibis are significantly declining (2).,The Aldabra population of the Madagascar sacred ibis estimated in 2001 to be around 300 to 750 individuals currently receives significant protection (2). The entire atoll is designated a Strict Nature Reserve and a Natural World Heritage Site and only small scale ecotourism deep-sea fishing and limited exploitation of some resources are permitted. However the conservation of the island and enforcement of its protection are the responsibility of the Seychelles Island Foundation which requires subscriptions and donations in order to fund its valuable work (5).

Approximately 80% of its coastal woodland habitat has been cleared to make way for agricultural practices such as banana sugar-cane and pineapple plantations and for cattle grazing (6). Fragments of remaining habitat may not be large enough to support viable populations and are vulnerable to wildfires and to further clearing (5).,The mahogany glider is listed on the Australian Endangered Species Protection Act 1992 (6) and the Queensland Parks and Wildlife Service is working to protect the remaining areas of habitat (5). Nature refuges and areas of national park will be vital to maintain this species in the few forests where it is currently found (5).

Animalia,Maleny hairy crayfish ,Animalia,Arthropoda,Crustacea,Decapoda,Parastacidae,Euastacus (1),,The Maleny hairy crayfish is a particularly vulnerable species due to its extremely restricted range. Localised threats such as bush fires poor forest management practices habitat destruction and over-exploitation by collectors are all known to negatively impact this species\u2019 population. Disturbance to stream banks and burrows water pollution and urban development are also important threats to this species (5).,The Maleny hairy crayfish occurs within the Conondale and Mapleton Falls National Parks which may afford this species some level of protection (1) (2). However there are currently no specific conservation measures targeted at the Maleny hairy crayfish (1). All species in the <em>Euastacus</em> <strong>genus</strong> are designated as \u2018no take\u2019 species in Queensland under the Fisheries Act 1994 and must be released if captured (1) (2).

Animalia,Marbled murrelet ,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Charadriiformes,Alcidae,Brachyramphus (1),Length: 25 cm (2),In many areas the old-growth forests in which this murrelet breeds are subject to logging. Declines in areas where logging has not been a problem are thought to be due to a reduction in fish prey. Significant mortalities of this species have been caused by the birds becoming caught in gill-nets used in fishing and by oil spills (2).,Conservation measures taken to date include the protection of some areas supporting the marbled murrelet from future logging. Detailed research has been carried out on this murrelet and a recovery plan has been produced. Furthermore 179 km\xb2 of Afognak Island has been protected since 1998 by the Exxon Valdex Trustee Council. Proposed measures include research particularly into the feeding ecology of this bird in order to fully understand the threats facing it. It is vital that suitable nesting habitat is protected and that fish stocks in known feeding areas are not severely damaged (2).
Animalia,Markhor ,Animalia,Chordata,Mammalia,Cetartiodactyla,Bovidae,Capra (1),Male weight: 80 - 110 kg (2)Head-body length: 140 - 180 cm (2)Female weight: 32 - 50 kg (2),There are estimated to be less than 2500 markhor remaining in the wild with each subpopulation comprising less than 250 individuals (1). The main cause of the precipitous decline has been excessive hunting both for meat and for its impressive horns (1) (7). Owing to the occurrence of armed conflict and the ready availability of weapons through much of its range many populations have been hunted to extinction. In addition to being highly valued as a trophy species by sportsmen the horns are also used for traditional medicine in the East Asian market (1) (2) (7). Aside from hunting the markhor is also severely threatened by habitat loss and competition for food with domestic livestock (1).,Since the mid-1990s the markhor has been listed on Appendix I of CITES which prohibits all trade in this species without a permit. In addition it is legally protected through much of its range and occurs within several protected areas although enforcement is likely to be a problem in some regions. One of the most successful conservation initiatives for the markhor has been a trophy hunting program developed in Pakistan. Local communities are encouraged to conserve the markhor through economic incentives whereby a large percentage of the money generated by a small quota of legal trophy hunts goes to the community. Owing to the success of this program proposals have been made for the implementation of similar trophy hunting conservation schemes in other parts of the markhor's range (1).
Animalia,Marley's golden mole ,Animalia,Chordata,Mammalia,Afrosoricida,Chrysochloridae,Amblysomus (1),30 - 34 g (2),Habitat degradation brought about chiefly by overgrazing firewood collection and urbanization is likely to be the single greatest threat to Marley\u2019s golden mole. In some areas pesticide contamination and predation by domestic pets may be additional concerns (1).,There are no specific conservation measures in place for Marley\u2019s golden mole but it is known to occur in the protected Pongola Nature Reserve. In order to implement appropriate conservation measures further research is needed to clarify the uncertainty surrounding the distribution of this elusive species and to assess the relative importance of the various threats it faces (1).

Animalia,Marsh seedeater ,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Emberizidae,Sporophila (1),Length: 10 cm (2),The main threat to this species is collection for the caged bird trade. This practice has severely reduced population numbers and has resulted in the loss of the marsh seedeater from many areas of Argentina and it seriously threatens the survival of populations in Uruguay. Breeding site habitat degradation due to intensive cattle grazing afforestation with eucalyptus and pine pesticide contamination and drainage for agriculture particularly in southeast Uruguay have contributed to population declines. Mechanised agriculture invasive grasses and annual burning are proving detrimental to the marsh seedeater in its wintering habitat (2).,The marsh seedeater is legally protected in Brazil and Uruguay and collection is illegal in Argentina. It breeds in Potrerillo de Santa Teresa Reserve Uruguay and Ibera Provincial Reserve in Argentina. It winters in Emas National Park Brazil and migrating birds are found in several reserves in Paraguay and Argentina. Crucial to the survival of this species is the effective prohibition of trapping in all range states and the removal of incentives to afforest with eucalyptus and pine. It may also benefit from being added to the Convention on Migratory Species (CMS or Bonn Convention) (2).

Animalia,Melanopsis ,Animalia,Mollusca,Gastropoda,Sorbeoconcha,Melanopsidae,Melanopsis (1),,Removal of water from the sites in which <em>Melanopsis etrusca</em> lives is a major threat to this species (1) as it is unable to withstand desiccation (2). A large subpopulation located on a farm at Poggetti Vecchi is at high risk of extinction as a result of temporary drainage of the pool in which this <strong>mollusc</strong> species is found (1).,<em>Melanopsis etrusca </em>is a protected species in Tuscany and is listed under Annexes A and B of the Tuscany Regional Law 56/2000. This means that the species itself is protected and that its protection may require the designation of a Regional Important Site at the locations where it remains (1).

Animalia,Mexican water mouse ,Animalia,Chordata,Mammalia,Rodentia,Cricetidae,Rheomys (1),c. 88 g (3),In general water mice are considered very difficult to capture and so the exact status of many species is unknown (4) (5). However the Mexican water mouse is believed to be rare and to occupy a limited and severely fragmented range and has been recorded from only four locations making it particularly vulnerable (1) (2). The main threats to the species are deforestation which is reported to be occurring throughout its range and water pollution. The Mexican water mouse is reliant on areas of pristine habitat and any kind of water pollution including household pollution from the washing of clothes is a potential threat to its survival (1).,The Mexican water mouse is classed as \u2018Rare\u2019 by the Mexican government (8) but there are not known to be any specific conservation measures in place for the species. More research is needed to better understand this little-known rodent and to determine the status of its populations and its specialised habitat before appropriate conservation measures can be put in place (1).

Animalia,Mountain nyala ,Animalia,Chordata,Mammalia,Cetartiodactyla,Bovidae,Tragelaphus (1),150 - 320 kg (3) (4),The mountain nyala has undergone a substantial decline in recent decades from an estimated 7000 to 8000 individuals in the 1960s (2) (11) to perhaps fewer than 2500 today (1) although others believe it to number nearer 4000 (4). It has also reduced in range and remaining populations are fragmented making them particularly vulnerable (1) (10). The main threats to the mountain nyala come from human activity within its range with increasing human and livestock populations putting ever-increasing pressure on the species through illegal hunting competition with cattle predation by domestic dogs and habitat clearance for agriculture grazing firewood harvesting and settlement (1) (2) (4) (10) (11). The species has been extensively hunted for its meat and horns and there is continued pressure from the trophy hunting industry to increase hunting quotas (1) (4).,Despite being fully protected by law enforcement is generally absent and the mountain nyala is only effectively protected within a small area in the north of Bale Mountains National Park which is estimated to hold a large proportion of the total population (1) (9) (14). A smaller protected area Kuni-Muktar Wildlife Sanctuary was established for the species in 1990 but severe poaching deforestation cultivation and erosion were thought to have eliminated the mountain nyala there (1) (10) until the presence of a small population was confirmed in 2003 (4). No mountain nyalas are currently kept in captivity (2) (10) (12) and it has been suggested that a self-sustaining captive population be established as an insurance against further losses in the wild (1) (10).

Animalia,Nile lechwe ,Animalia,Chordata,Mammalia,Cetartiodactyla,Bovidae,Kobus (1),50 – 300 kg (2),Like much of the wildlife of the Sudd Machar and Gambella wetlands the Nile lechwe has been severely affected by civil war which has resulted in the resettlement of human populations in these areas; consequently hunting of the Nile lechwe for meat has increased intensified by the proliferation of firearms (1). In addition human expansion has meant that there has been an increase in cattle farming resulting in competition for the Nile lechwe\u2019s resources (6). As a result of these threats the Nile lechwe population is estimated to have declined by more than 50 percent over recent years (1). In the Sudd wetlands and Zeraf Reserve the situation for wildlife is likely to worsen as a result of oil exploration and exploitation in the region (1).,In Sudan the Nile lechwe occurs in three protected areas: Zeraf Fannyikang and Shambe and in Ethiopia the species occurs in Gambella National Park (1). However the benefits of these nominally protected areas are limited as the Nile lechwe shares these areas with huge herds of cattle (1). There are currently thought to be over 400 Nile lechwe held in captivity in zoos across the world (7) which can act as insurance should the worst happen to the wild population and allows an opportunity to learn more about this threatened antelope.

Animalia,North Island brown kiwi ,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Apterygiformes,Apterygidae,Apteryx (1),Length: 40 cm (2)Male weight: 2.2 kg (3)Female weight: 2.8 kg (3),North Island brown kiwis have undergone a dramatic decline and as much as 90 percent of the population may have been lost since the start of the 20th Century (2). Research since the early 1990s has revealed that kiwi numbers in unmanaged areas of the North Island have been declining by about four percent a year (5). These birds evolved on an island that lacked terrestrial mammalian predators and have been devastated by the introduction of species such as dogs stoats and cats (5); a single dog is known to have killed roughly 500 birds in one six-week period (2). Around 95 percent of chicks never reach sexual maturity primarily as a result of predation but also as the results of accidents such as falls from cliffs drowning and encounters with traps or poison set for possums (3) (5). The loss of much of New Zealand's habitat has exacerbated these threats by isolating surviving populations and predators in fragmented pockets of remaining habitat (5).,The North Island brown kiwi is the subject of a concerted and wide-ranging conservation programme managed by the New Zealand Department of Conservation and Bank of New Zealand Save the Kiwi (3) (4). A number of different strategies are being employed including the protection of wild nests and chicks by trapping predators the artificial incubation of eggs and chicks in predator-free environments until they are big enough and old enough to cope with stoats and cats and breeding of captive birds for release into the wild (3) (4). In the species' stronghold of Northland the Whangarei Kiwi Sanctuary has been established whilst on the Coromandel Penninsula Moehau Kiwi Sanctuary protects the individuals located there (5). Where there is active management of populations and predator control North Island brown kiwi numbers have shown dramatic increases (5). It is hoped that the many conservation measures in place will help to preserve New Zealand's national bird for generations to come.
Animalia,North Pacific right whale ,Animalia,Chordata,Mammalia,Cetartiodactyla,Balaenidae,Eubalaena (1),40 – 80 tons (2),Historically the North Pacific right whale was abundant throughout the North Pacific; however today only a relict population exists and the eastern sub-population is close to extinction. Intensive commercial whaling began in 1835 when European and American whaling industries significantly reduced populations to critically low numbers. International protection in 1935 by the International Whaling Commission (IWC) allowed the North Pacific right whale some respite from the intensive hunting pressure and the species began to slowly recover. However illegal whaling by the Soviet Union primarily in the early 1960s killed 372 individuals in the eastern North Pacific and an unknown number in the western population. This together with a catch of 23 whales for scientific purposes removed a substantial proportion of the population and the species\u2019 ability to recover to pre-whaling numbers was severely compromised (5) (9).\xa0\xa0\xa0,Due to an extremely small population size estimated at only a few hundred in the western North Pacific and only tens of animals in the distinct eastern population the North Pacific right whale urgently requires research to identify and mitigate potential threats (1) (5). The North Pacific right whale\u2019s breeding and calving grounds need to be located and protected while further surveys are required to provide insight into the species\u2019 habitat use and migration timing. The North Pacific right whale continues to receive full international protection but it is unclear if populations are recovering (1).

Animalia,Northern bettong ,Animalia,Chordata,Mammalia,Diprotodontia,Potoroidae,Bettongia (1),1 – 1.5 kg (2),Numbers of this rare species are thought to be declining (1). This fall in numbers has been attributed to several different threats in particular the alteration of the northern bettong\u2019s preferred habitat as a result of a change in fire regimes in the last half century. Less frequent fires have allowed rainforest to encroach into the species\u2019 eucalypt forest habitat and along with invasive <strong>feral</strong> pigs this has affected the supply of its primary food source truffles. Over-grazing has also substantially diminished vegetation which the bettong requires for both shelter and food such as cockatoo grass. Furthermore predation by domestic dogs is of concern particularly in areas where humans live close to bettong habitat (1) (4).,Some of the northern bettong\u2019s range lies within protected areas including the Lamb Range State Forest Wet Tropics World Heritage Area and the Davies Creek National Park (1) which should hopefully offer some protection from the many threats it faces. In addition a recovery plan for the northern bettong has been established which includes plans for the maintenance of habitat a restriction on forest clearing activities the monitoring and management of fire and grazing regimes and the monitoring and control of <strong>feral</strong> pigs and predators (11). It is hoped that the recovery plan will improve the conservation status of the northern bettong not only by maintaining the existing wild populations but also by creating new ones.
Animalia,Northern corroboree frog ,Animalia,Chordata,Amphibia,Anura,Myobatrachidae,Pseudophryne (1),Length: 25 – 30 mm (2),The decline of the northern corroboree frog has been monitored with despair as the exact cause of the drop in numbers and that of other Australian amphibian species is not known. Factors thought to be contributing include the detrimental effects of introduced plants such as blackberry (<i>Rubus fruticosus</i>) and monkey musk (<i>Mimulus moschatus</i>) which smother the breeding sites of the frog as well as the trampling effects of feral pigs and introduced horses (1). Habitat loss erosion and human disturbance are also thought to have contributed (3). A pathogen called Chytrid fungus has been detected in museum specimens and is now the major suspect for the cause of the decline (1) (4).,Much of the habitat occupied by northern corroboree frogs is within reserves providing protection for the frogs and their habitat. Research into the behaviour biology and range of the frog is being undertaken and population monitoring is in place (1).
Animalia,Northern hopping mouse ,Animalia,Chordata,Mammalia,Rodentia,Muridae,Notomys (1),25 – 50 g (3),The threats facing this species are not clear at present. Possible threats include predation by feral cats as well as habitat degradation caused by strip-mining for manganese (1). The invasion of foreign weed species and grazing by livestock may also threaten the northern hopping mouse by reducing the availability of its preferred plant food (3).\xa0,The northern hopping mouse is not found within any conservation reserves (6); however the Arnhem Land region is managed for conservation by the Dhimurru Land Management Aboriginal Corporation (5). In 2004 a recovery plan for this species was created by Australia\u2019s Department of the Environment and Heritage. The plan outlines measures to protect this species including management to reduce the number of feral cats and protecting Groote Eylandt to limit the chance of any new threat being introduced (3). It also recommended that further research is undertaken on this species to shed more light on its ecological requirements which will help inform future management plans (3).\xa0
Animalia,Northern rockhopper penguin ,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Sphenisciformes,Spheniscidae,Eudyptes (1),3 kg (2),A recent study of the northern rockhopper penguin population (published in 2009) has shown that well over one million birds have been lost from the breeding colonies on the islands of Tristan da Cunha and Gough. While this equates to declines of over 90 percent on both islands on Gough this loss has occurred in just 45 years whereas on the main island of Tristan it has taken almost three times longer. The reasons for the swift decline on Gough are currently unknown but the penguin may be suffering increased levels of predation as well as competition for food from the rapidly rising population of Subantarctic Fur Seals <i>Arctocephalus tropicalis</i> (5). Other factors may include increasing disturbance and pollution introduced predators reduced food supplies due to overfishing and climate change (4).,While the northern rockhopper penguin population is being regularly monitored in order to safeguard against further declines it is imperative that the causes of the population crash be determined (4) (5). This should be targeted at all possible factors including studies of interactions with commercial fisheries the impact of the introduced predatory house mouse on chick survival on Gough Island (4) and the effects of fur seal predation and competition (5). Without the implementation of appropriate conservation measures this charismatic species will continue to nose dive towards extinction (5).

Animalia,Okinawa rail ,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Gruiformes,Rallidae,Gallirallus (1),435 g (2),The Okinawa rail only has one very small population with a tiny range on a single island rendering it extremely vulnerable. Furthermore both its range and population are undergoing continuing declines due to introduced predators and loss of forest to logging dam construction and associated road-building and agriculture (3). Predation by mongooses originally introduced to kill the poisonous habu snake is thought to be having a significant impact on this bird along with possible predation by feral dogs and cats (3) (4) (6).,The Okinawa rail is legally protected in Japan. Yonaha-dake and parts of Mount Ibu and Mount Nishime are designated as protected areas and in 1996 Yambaru was designated as a national park. Since 1970 conservation organisations have been campaigning for the protection of Okinawa\u2019s forests and have bought some sites on Mount Yonaha to establish private wildlife reserves (3). The Ministry of the Environment of Japan has recently drawn up a protection plan for this rare bird which includes an artificial breeding programme and culling of the bird\u2019s predators (6). Only time will tell how successful these plans will prove to be in saving the species from extinction.

Animalia,Otago skink ,Animalia,Chordata,Reptilia,Squamata,Scincidae,Oligosoma (1),Length: 25 – 30 cm (2),Over the last 25 years the Otago skink has declined in both numbers and range and as these worrying declines continue (2) this <strong>endemic</strong> reptile is now considered to be Endangered (1). Although the exact causes behind these declines have not been clearly identified habitat loss and the effects of introduced species are believed to be the main factors responsible (2) (4). The conversion of tussock grassland and native scrub to agricultural land as well as grazing and burning reduce the amount of native fruits and <strong>invertebrates</strong> on which the skink feeds (4). Similarly mining quarrying forestry and invasion by weeds can reduce the amount of suitable habitat for the Otago skink (4). Mammalian predators are also a significant threat to the survival of Otago skink populations largely due to their enormous numbers; cats ferrets stoats weasels ship rats Norway rats hedgehogs and mice are all potential predators of the Otago skink (4).,Despite its worrying situation the Otago skink is thankfully the subject of a number of conservation measures. It is fully protected by law meaning that it is an offence to capture or disturb this species (2) and most of the skink populations in the eastern part of its range exist in land protected and managed by the New Zealand Department of Conservation (4). A recovery plan for this species was first published in 1995 and a second plan was published in 2006 (4). After the first one measures were implemented to control cats and ferrets in certain areas but the skink populations failed to recover. Thus a new management scheme was imposed to see if skink populations recover if all mammalian predators are eradicated or removed (4). Certain populations will be surrounded by a mammal-proof fence and all mammals eradicated within the area while other will have no fence and instead traps will be used to control predators. The effects of these treatments are not anticipated to be detected until 2009 and then depending on the outcome the most successful measure can then be implemented in other populations (4).

Animalia,Pale-headed brush-finch ,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Emberizidae,Atlapetes (1),Length: 16 cm (2),Habitat loss from human landscape modification seems to be the primary reason for the bird\u2019s limited distribution and remains a major concern for the species\u2019 long term survival (4) (5). In the arid valleys of the R\xedo Jubones drainage areas where water is available have been widely cultivated and large numbers of cattle and goats have stripped the area of vegetation (2) (3). Local use of fires to clear vegetation also potentially threatens suitable habitat particularly if these fires get out of control (2). Another major threat is brood parasitism from the shiny cowbird which has expanded its range considerably in recent decades and is now the most widespread brood parasite of South America and abundant in the R\xedo Jubones drainage (4). Brood parasitism has significantly impacted the breeding success of the pale-headed brush-finch with a shocking 61 percent\xa0of pairs breeding in Yunguilla Reserve parasitized in 2002 (5).,After the rediscovery of this rare bird in 1998 the small 27 hectares patch of suitable habitat in which it was found was purchased by Fundacion Jocotoco to form the Yunguilla Reserve which has since been progressively expanded to cover most of the known population (3). This Reserve has been securely fenced off to prevent grazing pressure with a local landowner hired as a part time guardian. In 2002 a habitat management scheme was implemented to halt vegetation growth and convert unsuitable to suitable habitat by selectively thinning dense thickets (2). In order to assess the success of the habitat management scheme implemented in 2002 a habitat occupancy monitoring scheme was set up with Fundacion Jocotoco in 2004 (2) (5). In 2003 a hunter was employed to remove shiny cowbirds from the reserve during the pale-headed brush-finch\u2019s breeding season with a resultant 69 cowbirds shot (5). Cowbird removal strongly increased reproductive success that year with 16 chicks fledging in Yunguilla Reserve compared to just five the previous year (2). Further cowbird removal has been conducted and in 2005 the parasitism rate was down to two percent (3). Fundacion Jocotoco has also made repeated visits to local agencies land owners and schools in order to raise local awareness of the plight of this species (5). These intensive conservation measures have helped save the species from immediate extinction having significantly increased the population from just 10 to 12 pairs in 1999 to over\xa050 pairs in 2006 and approximate 230 mature individuals in 2011\xa0(2) (3) (5). However further population growth is thought to be strongly constrained by a lack of suitable habitat to accommodate it (2) (5). Thus although great progress has been made since the pale-headed brush-finch\u2019s rediscovery much remains to be done to overcome the immediate threats to its long-term survival (5).

Animalia,Philippine tube-nosed fruit bat ,Animalia,Chordata,Mammalia,Chiroptera,Pteropodidae,Nyctimene (1),Length: 14.2 cm (2)Wingspan: 55 cm (3),Populations of this unusual-looking bat have declined dramatically since 1950 due to extensive habitat destruction and the threat of extinction now lingers dangerously close (5). Habitat has been destroyed by clearing and illegal logging leaving less than just 1 % of original old-growth lowland forest remaining on Negros Island where the largest population of this species is found (3). Lowland rainforest on Cebu Island is virtually gone altogether and it is not known if this species still survives there as it has not been seen for over 10 years. Thus the Philippine tube-nosed bat now clings to a precarious existence edging slowly closer to extinction as illegal logging and clearing continue to reduce vital habitat ever further (4).,Both Mount Canlaon and a part of the mountainous southern fragment where this bat is thought to occur on Negros Island are designated by the national government as protected areas. Nevertheless deforestation continues to pose a serious threat including in the beautiful Twin Lakes Region that falls within the southern \u2018protected area\u2019 (6). If the remaining forest fragments were adequately protected this rare and intriguing species may have a chance of survival (2) but if current rates of habitat loss continue the future for this bat looks pretty bleak.

The two islands where the racer persists are mongoose-free but additional threats include other introduced animals such as cats dogs and rats (9) as well as negative local attitudes towards the snake (4).,Fortunately there are some systems in place to conserve the red-bellied racer. For example on St Eustatius the Quill-Boven National Park is a protected area which provides suitable habitat for red-bellied racers with plenty of rocky terrain (4) (11).

Animalia,Restinga antwren ,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passerifirmes,Thamnophilidae,Formicivora (1),Length: 12.5 cm (2),The restricted habitat on which the restinga antwren depends is under enormous pressure from beachfront development for housing and holiday resorts and from the salt industry (2) (3) (5) (7). Owing to a burgeoning human population in the region squatters are also posing an additional threat to its habitat while nest predation by alien predators has become a problem more recently (3). If further habitat loss and degradation continues this highly specialised species is at high risk of going extinct (2) (3). However recent surveys have shown that its range may extend further than previously estimated and as a result its conservation status may warrant downlisting to Endangered in the future (2) (5).,Although small amounts of restinga habitat are protected within three designated areas enforcement has been relatively ineffective with clearance of vegetation still occurring within the reserves\u2019 boundaries (2) (3). Fortunately conservation efforts have proliferated in recent years particularly since SAVE Brasil appointed local NGO <em>Pingo D'\xe1gua</em> BirdLife Species Guardian for the restinga antwren. This valuable partnership is supporting further research into the restinga antwren\u2019s ecology as well as an awareness campaign aimed at local schools the preparation of a Species Action Plan the removal of alien predators such as the common marmoset and the creation of a new reserve which will afford far greater protection to the area then currently exists (2) (3) (7) (9). It is hoped that these admirable efforts will result in the restinga antwren\u2019s recovery and in doing so set a precedent for the vital protection of other species facing similar threats (3).

Animalia,Rufous flycatcher ,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Tyrannidae,Myiarchus (1),ca. 21 - 25 g (3),The rufous flycatcher has undergone a decline in both numbers and distribution and its small population restricted to a tiny and fragmented range makes it particularly vulnerable to extinction. The main threat to the species is the increasing human population in the region bringing with it an increase in grazing pressure overcollection of firewood and the deliberate killing of flycatchers which predate bees at the hives of local bee-keepers. In some areas the cutting of live wood is prohibited but this has led to an increased demand for dead wood which may reduce the availability of cavity nest sites for this species (2).,Further survey work is needed to clarify the current distribution and status of the rufous flycatcher and may well reveal that it is more widespread and common than previously believed (2). However no specific conservation actions are known to be in place for the species although it is reported to occur in the Pomac Forest Historical Sanctuary (Santuario Historico Bosque de Pomac) (2) and within the Chaparri Private Conservation Area a community owned and managed private reserve (6). Habitat protection and the banning of grazing and of firewood collection in <i>Prosopsis</i> and <i>Acacia</i> woodland together with raising awareness of the species\u2019 plight and encouraging bee-keepers not to kill flycatchers will also be needed to protect this <strong>endemic</strong> flycatcher from extinction (2).

Animalia,Sardinian brook newt ,Animalia,Chordata,Amphibia,Caudata,Salamandridae,Euproctus (1),Total length: Up to 15 cm, but usually smaller (1).,This European newt is highly endangered and only a few populations are known. In spite of intensive searches executed by various experienced herpetologists only a handful of the historical localities could be verified (5) and it is feared that this species is the rarest and most threatened salamander in Europe (7).<br/>\r\nThere are three probable causes for the decline of <i>E. platycephalus</i>:<br/>\r\n(a) Treatment of water bodies with DDT in the 1950's in the battle against malaria.<br/>\r\n(b) The introduction of trout which may be a threat to the salamanders themselves or compete with the salamanders for food.<br/>\r\n(c) The reduction of water levels due to increasing demand for water from both the tourism and agricultural industries (5).,No specific conservation measurements are being taken for the Sardinian brook newt. However the Habitats Directive strictly protects this species and protected habitats are being proposed to the EU-Commission by Italy (4). In addition there is a captive breeding program to keep this species alive in captivity (8).

Animalia,Scaly-sided merganser ,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Anseriformes,Anatidae,Mergus (1),Size: 52 – 58 cm (2),This rare stunning bird has undergone significant declines as a result of habitat destruction persecution and disturbance. Populations suffered badly in Russia in the 1960s and 1970s when a period of intense economic development led to extensive habitat destruction and alteration. Thankfully large scale deforestation in river valleys has since been banned and the rapid decline in this species\u2019 population was halted (5). Nevertheless a variety of other threats still affect the scaly-sided merganser in Russia including forest fires illegal hunting drowning in fishermens' nets disturbance from motor boats during the breeding season river pollution and natural predators (2) (5). In China breeding populations continue to decline rapidly in the face of deforestation illegal hunting human disturbance and the use of poisons and/or explosives for fishing and have disappeared from much of their former range (2).,The scaly-sided merganser is a Nationally Protected Species (First Class) in China a protected species (category 1) in North Korea and a protected species in South Korea (5). This bird can also be found in a number of protected areas in both its breeding and wintering range notably Sikhote-Alin' State Biosphere Reserve in Russia and Changbai Shan Nature Reserve in China (2) (5). A number of studies of this species have been conducted including research that has shown females readily use artificial nest boxes with several returning to breed in the same boxes in subsequent years. Over 130 artificial nest boxes have been erected alongside Russian rivers (8) which not only increase the availability of nest sites and therefore breeding capacity but also provide a valuable opportunity to study the breeding biology of this rare duck.

Since the species has such a small population and restricted range of just 230 square kilometres the owl has been officially classified on the IUCN Red List as Endangered (2) (6). These are both declining due to habitat loss and degradation (3).,The Serendib scops-owl is found in five protected areas each administered as a Forest Reserve or a Proposed Reserve by the Forest Department of Sri Lanka (2). However further population surveys are required to better understand the abundance and distribution of this species which for so long managed to elude detection in its forest home. Such studies would help guide effective conservation measures in the future to ensure that this mysterious owl whose incredible discovery is a testament to one man\u2019s perseverance and dedication is never lost again.
Animalia,Seychelles wolf snake ,Animalia,Chordata,Reptilia,Squamata,Colubridae,Lycognathophis (1),Length: up to 1.2 m (2),Considered to be at risk from extinction the Seychelles wolf snake is being impacted by both invasive species and habitat degradation (1).  The Seychelles wolf snake is preyed on by the tenrec (<i>Tenrec ecaudatus</i>) an opportunistic feeder that was introduced to the islands of Mah\xe9 and Praslin probably as a source of food (1) (2) while another introduced species <i>Cinnamomum verum</i> is impacting the snake\u2019s habitat (1).  Introduced to the islands in 1772 and subsequently spreading so rapidly that by the end of the 19th century extensive forests of this plant existed (5) this cinnamon plant continues to invade and degrade native forests (1).   The fairly restricted distribution of this species makes it particularly susceptible to the impacts of any threats it faces (1).,The Seychelles wolf snake occurs in a number of protected areas throughout its range including Morne Seychellois and Praslin National Parks and Aride Special Reserve (1).  However a significant population on Silhouette Island does not occur in any protected area and it has therefore been recommended that a national park or reserve should be established in order to protect this population (1).

Animalia,Shore plover ,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Charadriiformes,Charadriidae,Thinornis (1),60 g (2),Predation by introduced cats and rats caused the original precipitous decline of shore plover numbers from mainland coasts and from the other Chatham Islands (3). The population on Rangatira Island was itself decimated by human collectors who took hundreds of specimens for scientific purposes at the beginning of the 20th Century (2). Today the shore plover is extremely vulnerable as the species is mainly restricted to a single island; the accidental introduction of predators or a natural disaster has the potential to completely wipe out this species (2). However the discovery in 1999 of a second small population and progress with the establishment of new populations in the Chathams and mainland New Zealand does provide slightly more stability for the species (5).,Conservation efforts to save the shore plover represent one of the first cases worldwide to establish new populations of a strong-flying shorebird (3). Rangatira Nature Reserve was established in 1954 (6) but the key to the survival of this species will be the creation of independent populations elsewhere. Relocations to other predator-free islands in the Chatham group initially failed due to these birds' strong homing instincts; individuals returned to Rangatira Island (6). A captive population is being held at the National Wildlife Centre at Mount Bruce and this provides birds for <strong>translocations</strong> to island locations off mainland New Zealand (4). Recent transfers to Mangere Nature Reserve (Mangere Island is also within the Chatham group) have been more successful; between 2001 and 2002 28 birds were relocated (5). As of September 2002 11 birds were present on Mangere Island and one chick had fledged successfully (5). The population of shore plovers on Rangatira Island is only around 123 birds (5) but sustained conservation efforts continue to produce encouraging results for the future of this attractive bird.

Animalia,Slackwater darter ,Animalia,Chordata,Actinopterygii,Perciformes,Percidae,Etheostoma (1),Length: c. 4.6 cm (2)Maximum length: 7.8 cm (2),With an extremely restricted range and a dependency upon areas with adjacent breeding and non-breeding sites the slackwater darter is extremely vulnerable to any detrimental changes to its habitat. Unfortunately urbanisation and agricultural activities are increasingly encroaching upon the species\u2019 habitat and consequently the species\u2019 habitat has dwindled and the population has declined (4). The principle agent behind this decline is the extraction of ground water for agriculture and human consumption causing breeding areas to dry up. Streams have also been dammed to form fish-farm ponds while pollutants seeping into the water table from septic tanks and sewer pipelines continue to degrade this rare species\u2019 habitat (4) (5). These threats are compounded by the species\u2019 short life span as two consecutive poor breeding seasons could wipe out a substantial portion of the remaining population (4) (6).,The future of the slackwater darter is very much dependant on the careful management of its habitat (4). The conservation objectives for this Endangered species are set out in a detailed recovery plan with the protection of both breeding and non-breeding habitat a key priority (6). Monitoring of water quality and surveys of population trends will also be required if the slackwater darter is to be saved (4).

Animalia,Slender antbird ,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Thamnophilidae,Rhopornis (1),23 – 28 g (2),Whilst still fairly common within its habitat the slender antbird has a very small range and the population may be declining as a result of habitat loss.  In 1990 only 5 \u2013 20 percent of dry forest in east Bahia remained having been steadily cleared for cattle pastures coffee plantations and firewood extraction (2).  Much of the remaining forest is apparently unsuitable for the slender antbird due to a high level of disturbance by livestock (3).,The slender antbird is protected by law in Brazil and since 2004 SAVE Brasil (Sociedade para a Conserva\xe7\xe3o das Aves do Brasil) the representative of Birdlife International in Brazil has been developing a conservation program for the slender antbird in Boa Nova (2) (3) (4). Since the project started the local community and landowners have become active participants in conservation activities in the region and even adopted the slender antbird as the symbol of Boa Nova (4). In addition the project has facilitated further research into the slender antbird\u2019s breeding behaviour and raised conservation awareness through campaigns workshops and educational material about the slender antbird and the biodiversity of Boa Nova (4) (6). Furthermore SAVE have developed a proposal for the creation of a 32000 hectare protected public area in the region (4).

However the actual levels of protection provided on the ground are limited particularly in the case of Nkandla Forest and local communities may be having a detrimental impact on these forests and the wildlife they support (1).

Animalia,Southern tuco-tuco ,Animalia,Chordata,Mammalia,Rodentia,Ctenomyidae,Ctenomys (1),250 - 600g (2),The main threat to the southern tuco-tuco is the loss of its costal habitat a consequence of both the development of tourist resorts and the creation of pine plantations (1).,There are currently no known specific conservation measures in place to protect the southern tuco-tuco (1).
Animalia,Southern white-cheeked gibbon ,Animalia,Chordata,Mammalia,Primates,Hylobatidae,Nomascus (1),7 - 10 kg (2),The southern white-cheeked gibbon is one of the most endangered primates in Vietnam (9). It occupies an area where there is a high human population meaning the threat of hunting for food the pet trade and for use in traditional medicine is prevalent. It is also threatened by habitat loss as most of its natural range has been heavily fragmented through logging and agricultural encroachment (7). As a result it is believed that the southern white-cheeked gibbon population has declined by 50 percent in the last 45 years (1).,This primate is protected from international trade as it is listed on Appendix I of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) meaning that trade in this species is only permitted in highly exceptional circumstances (3). Its range covers protected areas and national parks although there is not sufficient enforcement in these areas against forest encroachment and poaching (1). It is also protected in Vietnam at the highest level through the wildlife protection law (7).
Animalia,Spanish toothcarp ,Animalia,Chordata,Actinopterygii,Cyprinodontiformes,Cyprinodontidae,Aphanius (1),Male total length: 4.5 cm (2)Female total length: 6 cm (2),Populations of the Spanish toothcarp are estimated to have declined by at least 50 percent in the past ten years and with numbers continuing to decrease its threatened status shows no signs of improving (1). This population decline is due in part to competition with the mosquitofish (<em>Gambusia holbrooki</em>) (2); introduced by man to the region as a method of\xa0 controlling mosquito numbers this fish is one of the most invasive fish species worldwide (5). As a result the Spanish toothcarp is now restricted to bodies of water where the mosquitofish is absent (1).,The Spanish toothcarp has been the focus of a number of conservation actions.\xa0 A project in Catalonia running from 1996 until 2000 worked to conserve the toothcarp and other species and a captive breeding program resulted in 20000 Spanish toothcarps being released back into the wild (6). In Murcia conservation efforts have included the elimination of the invasive fish species habitat management and restoration and captive breeding of the Spanish toothcarp (7). However whilst introductions of captive bred individuals help boost population numbers of this species the threats to the Spanish toothcarp\u2019s natural habitat need to be tackled if its future is to be secured (1).
Animalia,Speartooth shark ,Animalia,Chordata,Chondrichthyes,Carcharhiniformes,Carcharhinidae,Glyphis (1),Male length: up to 157 cm (1)Female length: up to 175 cm (1),There is no long-term information on the extent to which fishing has affected the speartooth shark due to its natural rarity. However recreational and commercial fishing including gillnetting for barramundi (<em>Lates calcarifer</em>) is believed to be the most prominent threat to this species (1) (3) (4) (7).,The speartooth shark is listed as \u2018critically endangered\u2019 by the Commonwealth Environmental Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act of 1999 (1) (3). It occurs in rivers within the Kakadu National Park in the Northern Territory Australia. This is likely to protect it to some extent from commercial fishing and habitat modification but the effects of uranium mining in the park are unknown. The speartooth shark also occurs in Lakefield National Park in Queensland but is not protected from commercial fishing there (3) (4).
Animalia,Speckle-chested piculet ,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Piciformes,Picidae,Picumnus (1),Length: 10 cm (2),In the 1980s deforestation for the establishment of coca plantations was the largest threat to the speckle-chested piculet. Today habitat loss remains the greatest threat primarily due to human population growth and immigration in the region which has led to an increase in logging and agriculture particularly coffee plantations. Such habitat alteration reduces the number of nesting areas and the supply of food for the speckle-chested piculet considerably disrupting its activity and ability to reproduce. These threats are most prominent in the south-eastern parts of the speckle-chested piculet\u2019s range where forest is now restricted to only the highest slopes (2).\xa0,While in most areas forest clearance continues unabated the speckle-chested piculet\u2019s habitat is protected within the Alto Mayo Protected Forest an area which has been protected since 1986 (2).
Animalia,Speke’s gazelle ,Animalia,Chordata,Mammalia,Cetartiodactyla,Bovidae,Gazella (1),15 – 25 kg (2),Uncontrolled hunting for its meat competition with domestic livestock for grazing degradation of its habitat and drought are all serious ongoing problems for the survival of Speke\u2019s gazelle (1) (5). Unfortunately Somalia\u2019s unstable political climate over the last 20 years has meant that there has been no centralised government to implement any protective measures for this species (1). More recently an illegal wildlife trade which includes antelopes has developed yet another threat to a species whose survival is already at risk (1).,It was predicted in 1998 that in the absence of protective measures Speke\u2019s gazelle would decline in conservation status from Vulnerable to Endangered (5). The fact that this change in conservation status has occurred highlights the uncertain future of this species in the wild. The total population of Speke\u2019s gazelle declined by 50 percent in the period 1988 to 2006 and there are still no schemes in place to protect this animal or its habitat within its current range (1). There are however a number of populations being successfully bred in captivity which will at least serve to protect this unique animal from total extinction and offer a hope for the reintroduction of populations to the wild (1) (4).

Animalia,Spiny river snail ,Animalia,Mollusca,Gastropoda,Sorbeoconcha,Pleuroceridae,Io (1),Length: up to 5 cm (2),The main reason for the decline in the spiny river snail\u2019s population is the reduction in water quality from industrial and agricultural pollution. Dam construction has also caused further degradation of the habitat in which the spiny river snail lives. The dams effectively turn the river into a reservoir eliminating current flow and increasing water depth thus altering the habitat for the spiny river snail to such an extent that the snail is unable to tolerate the changed environment (4).,Conservation and recovery efforts for this freshwater snail include artificial culture water pollution control and most importantly habitat protection and restoration (4).

Animalia,Spotted turtle ,Animalia,Chordata,Reptilia,Testudines,Emydidae,Clemmys (1),Maximum length: 13.6 cm (2) (3),Spotted turtle numbers are declining due to unsustainable collection for the pet trade habitat destruction and fragmentation road mortality agriculture and pollution (2) (12). The drainage of wetlands deepening of marsh habitats in favour of waterfowl populations and the conversion of wetlands into agricultural and residential land has resulted in the loss fragmentation and modification of the spotted turtle\u2019s habitat. This has left remaining spotted turtles living in very small isolated subpopulations which are more vulnerable to the effects of <strong>inbreeding</strong> over-collection for the pet trade and predation (7) (11). In addition road related mortality is thought to be a significant factor for nests and hatchlings as well as female adults as they travel over land to nest (4) (6). In Ontario pollution of aquatic habitats by substances such as DDT and PCB\u2019s is also thought to be a problem for some spotted turtle populations (6). Predators such as raccoons dogs snapping turtles skunks foxes and other small mammals are responsible for the low recruitment of juveniles preying most heavily on eggs and hatchlings but occasionally also on adults (4) (6). Unfortunately the spotted turtle\u2019s life history traits namely high egg (and probably hatchling) mortality low reproductive potential in the wild delayed sexual maturity (7 to 14 years) balanced by a long potential adult breeding life deem it highly vulnerable to population collapses when faced with these threats (2) (10). If adult survivorship is reduced through factors such as human exploitation road mortality or increased predator levels populations are inevitably unable to produce and successfully raise enough offspring to recover depleted numbers leading eventually to local extinctions (2) (11).,Spotted turtles are legally protected to some degree from exploitation in most states and provinces in which they are found but protection is not yet consistent or universal over the turtle's range (2) (5). In Canada the spotted turtle is listed as Endangered by the Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada (COSEWIC) (2004) and is listed as a Specially Protected Reptile (Schedule 9) in the Fish and Wildlife Conservation Act (1997). In the U.S. the spotted turtle is not currently listed in the US Federal Endangered Species Act; however it is listed in 22 of the states in which it occurs (2). Furthermore there is insufficient protection of its wetland habitat a matter which needs addressing if the species is to be given a good chance of long-term survival (4).

Animalia,Stephens' kangaroo rat ,Animalia,Chordata,Mammalia,Rodentia,Heteromyidae,Dipodomys (1),c. 67 g (2),Much of the habitat of Stephens\u2019 kangaroo rat has been lost due to urbanisation and agriculture and remaining areas of suitable habitat are severely fragmented (1) (2) (3) (5) (7). Within the fragments its populations are threatened by loss of <strong>genetic diversity</strong> and unequal sex ratios which leave populations vulnerable to local extinctions. Urbanisation has also resulted in unnaturally high levels of predation from <strong>feral</strong> and domestic cats putting further strain on population numbers (1) (3).,Complete protection of Stephens\u2019 kangaroo rat and its habitat must be granted by the California Fish and Game Commission to ensure its future survival (2). Some land has been purchased by Riverside County in California to create reserves (1) and dispersal corridors have been established to link separate habitat areas (3) (6). Large habitats at higher altitudes should be protected to provide refuge during times of drought and to support larger more <strong>genetically diverse</strong> populations (1).

Animalia,Storm’s stork ,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Ciconiiformes,Ciconiidae,Ciconia (1),Size: 75 - 91 cm (2),Storm\u2019s stork has a very small fragmented population that is rapidly declining due to destruction of its lowland forest habitat through logging dam construction and conversion to oil-palm plantations. The major fires of 1997-1998 on Sumatra and Borneo are thought to have had a significant impact on this bird and the development of lowland rivers as major transport routes is considered a considerable threat. Fortunately incidental hunting and trade are minor threats to this species (2).,Storm\u2019s stork is legally protected in Thailand Malaysia and Indonesia and has been recorded in several protected areas including at least five (and one proposed) in Kalimantan at least four (and a further four proposed) on Sumatra and four in Malaysia (2).

Animalia,Tahiti reed-warbler ,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Sylviidae,Acrocephalus (1),Length: 17 – 19 cm (2),The Tahiti reed-warbler is restricted to only one island which makes it very vulnerable to a number of threats and its disappearance from three other Society Islands (Moorea Huahine and Raiatea) in the past show the warbler\u2019s susceptibility to extinction (2). At present it is estimated that there are only a few hundred individuals remaining and these are threatened by habitat alteration and disturbance as a result of an invasive weed bamboo harvesting road and dam construction and four-wheel drive vehicles (2). It is very likely that the Tahiti reed-warbler is also affected by introduced species such as the black rat and the common myna which may compete for nesting sites (2).,Luckily despite this bird\u2019s rarity and possible threats numbers of the Tahiti reed-warbler are thought to be stable. However it is important that surveys are undertaken to determine whether this is correct and also to monitor the effect that introduced species and habitat degradation has on this rare song-bird (4).
Animalia,Talaud rail ,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Gruiformes,Rallidae,Gymnocrex (1),Length: 33 - 35 cm (2)Bill length: 5.8 cm (3),Possible threats to the Talaud rail include hunting by locals predation by rats and habitat loss caused by agricultural development commercial timber and mineral extraction (2).\xa0,There are currently no conservation measures specifically targeting the Talaud rail. This species occurs in the Karakelang Wildlife Reserve but there is currently little effort to manage this site. A four-year project by the Global Environment Facility (GEF) is underway to introduce measures of protection. In 1995 a programme was launched to promote conservation awareness and fieldwork on the island and this is still ongoing (2).

Animalia,Treur River barb ,Animalia,Chordata,Actinopterygii,Cypriniformes,Cyprinidae,Barbus (1),Male head-body length: 98mm (2)Female head-body length: 108mm (2),The main reason for the decline of the Treur River barb population is believed to have been the introduction of predatory\xa0<strong>alien</strong>\xa0fish stock species (3). In particular introduced predators such as the rainbow trout (<em>Oncorhynchus mykiss</em>) and small mouth bass (<em>Microterus dolomieu</em>) have had a major impact on this species when they were introduced to the Treur River (1) (3).,In 1970 the only area in which the Treur River barb occured Bendigospruit was declared an International Biological Program\xa0(IBP) conservation site. This status restricted practices such as the introduction of new fish or bird species to the area and this has reduced disturbances to the stream and therefore to the Treur River barb (5). The land owners of the site also have their own conservation plan which includes clearing invasive plant species near the river bank (3).
Animalia,Tricoloured blackbird ,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Icteridae,Agelaius (1),Length: 18 – 24 cm (2),Historically the tricoloured blackbird\u2019s population underwent a serious decline primarily due to habitat loss as a result of urbanisation conversion of land for agriculture and the draining of wetlands. In addition hunting of this species for sale at markets and deliberate poisoning to safeguard crops were both extensively practiced up until their ban in 1970s and 1980s (4). Despite losing a great deal of its native habitat the tricoloured blackbird has adapted and today large numbers breed in silage and in upland regions (3). Unfortunately in these environments this species faces new threats as many colonies are being decimated by herbicide poisoning predation and in particular silage harvesting. The silage harvest takes place while the tricoloured blackbird is laying eggs and brooding chicks and may therefore destroy an entire colony\u2019s breeding efforts. With some silage colonies comprising tens of thousands of birds these losses represent a significant portion of this species\u2019 global population (3) (4).,Efforts to conserve the tricoloured blackbird have been made by the US Fish and Wildlife Service by either purchasing whole areas of silage from private landowners or by paying them to delay the silage harvest long enough to allow the tricoloured blackbird to successfully breed (4). While this has been extremely beneficial for the survival of tricoloured blackbird colonies the US Fish and Wildlife Service do not consider it to be a long-term solution for the management of this species. Other proposed measures to conserve this species include delaying herbicide application until the tricoloured blackbird has completed its breeding cycle and the creation of areas of marshland and blackberries within key silage nesting regions offering a safe alternative breeding habitat (2).

Animalia,Tuamotu sandpiper ,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Charadriiformes,Scolopacidae,Prosobonia (1),32 – 44 g (2),The Tuamotu sandpiper has disappeared from much of its former range and is undergoing a continuing decline due to habitat loss and the effects of introduced species. The threats to the survival of this bird are mounting as its island environment becomes increasingly colonised encroached upon and disturbed by humans who destroy habitat for settlements and coconut plantations. The introduction of predators such as cats and rats particularly the black rat (<i>Rattus rattus</i>) is another serious concern and has probably eliminated the species from all but the most infrequently visited islands. As a result this formerly widespread bird is now restricted to just a few known locations that are typically predator-free uninhabited islands (3). An additional concern has been expressed about the impacts of climate change and sea-level rises which have the potential to flood and submerge the small islands on which this endangered species lives (5).,Research expeditions in 1999 2001 and 2003 have helped collect and collate valuable information on the Tuamotu sandpiper and its distribution but further surveys are still desperately needed (3) (6). Further conservation measures advocated include identifying suitable islands for translocation either rat and cat-free or where eradication is possible and developing a recovery plan for the species (3). If measures such as these are not undertaken soon this bird may fall victim to the ever growing extinction crisis that currently threatens our planet (2).

Ranchers clearing land for grazing view the Utah prairie dog as a pest which spreads disease and consumes vegetation that their cattle would otherwise eat and so commonly use poisonous bait scattered near burrow-entrances or poisonous gases injected into burrows to eliminate the prairie dog (1) (3) (11). Another threat is sylvatic (bubonic) plague which is caused by a bacterium (<em>Yersinia pestis</em>) and is transmitted by fleas. Plague is an introduced disease to which the Utah prairie dog has not had time to evolve a good defence (11).\xa0 Because of these threats Utah prairie dogs currently inhabit only about 5 percent of the area that they occupied 200 years ago (11).\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0,By 1991 populations of the Utah prairie dog had declined so steeply that the United States Fish and Wildlife Service classified it as an \u2018Endangered\u2019 species making it illegal to kill and a formal recovery plan was established. The plan involved moving prairie dog populations from private to public land thereby removing the temptation for farmers and ranchers to poison or shoot them. As a result of the success of this the classification was changed from \u2018Endangered\u2019 to \u2018Threatened\u2019 but as this allows this rare species to be hunted once again several petitioners want the status changed back to \u2018Endangered\u2019 (1) (11).\xa0

Farming of crops such as coffee mangos bananas and other tropical fruit has caused large-scale deforestation and degradation of the Venezuelan sylph\u2019s forest habitat. The increase in cash-crop agriculture a form of cultivation which produces crops for rapid growth and quick sale has resulted in uncontrolled burning of forests which also destroys or degrades the Venezuelan sylph\u2019s habitat. A potential risk of further habitat degradation also exists should development plans for road construction and gas pipelines in many areas of Venezuelan forest go ahead (2).,Protection of the Venezuelan sylph\u2019s habitat is essential to the long term survival of this species (2). It is possible that it occurs in the Peninsula de Paria National Park (6) which may afford it some protection (2). Further research is required to confirm the Venezuelan sylph\u2019s presence in the park and if populations are found careful monitoring should be carried out to assess the status of the population. Furthermore populations of the Venezuelan sylph should be studied throughout its fragmented range to identify the trends population sizes and additional threats to this species\u2019 survival (2).
Animalia,Vernal pool tadpole shrimp ,Animalia,Arthropoda,Crustacea,Notostraca,Triopsidae,Lepidurus (1),Adult length: 1.5 – 8.4 cm (2),The main threat to this species is the continued loss of its vernal pool habitat to agricultural and urban development in addition to degrading of its habitat as a result of overgrazing off-road vehicle use invasive plant species and contamination from fertilizers and pesticides (3) (4). In 2003 it was estimated that only nine percent of the vernal pool habitat in California\u2019s Central Valley remained (2).,In 1994 the U.S Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) gave the vernal pool tadpole shrimp protection as an Endangered species (5). Any projects which could directly or indirectly affect the vernal pool tadpole shrimp must first obtain a permit from the FWS which will only be issued if the continued existence of the vernal pool tadpole shrimp will not be jeopardized (3).

Animalia,Violet click beetle ,Animalia,Arthropoda,Insecta,Coleoptera,Elateridae,Limoniscus,Length: 12 mm (adult),The violet click\xa0beetle has always been rare in the UK in historic times and has not been found in the <strong>sub-fossil</strong> record to date. This suggests it has been rare for a very long time. However the particular conditions the beetle requires are hardly ever found and the felling of old trees for safety reasons means that its habitats are becoming even rarer.,Efforts in the UK have concentrated on providing more sites for the violet click\xa0beetle. There are few suitable trees on the British sites at Bredon Hill and Windsor. Some trees were found to contain <strong>larvae</strong> but none of the others seemed likely to provide the right conditions. Following the great storm of 1987 one old hollow beech in Windsor Forest blew down. Ted Green the (then) warden managed to re-erect it by using another living tree as support and then began to experiment with various 'rotting' ingredients to attempt to create the conditions needed by the violet click beetle. After seven years Ted's efforts bore fruit and five <strong>larvae</strong> were found inside his prepared tree. Plans are well under way to erect and prepare more suitable trees and even artificially 'age' some. This is taking place with the help of dead wood <strong>invertebrate</strong> and <strong>fungus</strong> specialists as part of English Nature's Species Recovery Programme.

Animalia,Wallace’s golden birdwing butterfly ,Animalia,Arthropoda,Insecta,Lepidoptera,Papilionidae,Ornithoptera (1),Wingspan: 13 – 19 cm (2),The rampant unsustainable logging that has taken place in the lowland areas of the Maluku Islands has significantly reduced the forest coverageand has no doubt reduced numbers of Wallace\u2019s golden birdwing butterfly (4). Large-scale commercial deforestation continues to pose a considerable threat to the future of Wallace\u2019s golden birdwing butterfly and other inhabitants of these biodiverse forests (4). In addition the extreme use of insecticides to combat mosquitoes may be having a detrimental effect on Wallace\u2019s golden birdwing butterfly although the impact of this has not yet been assessed (4).,While there are currently no known specific conservation measures in place for Wallace\u2019s golden birdwing butterfly a number of conservation organisations are working to conserve wildlife in this region of Indonesia.

Animalia,Wattle-necked softshell turtle ,Animalia,Chordata,Reptilia,Testudines,Trionychidae,Palea (1),Average length: 25 cm (2),In its natural range the wattle-necked softshell turtle is highly threatened by its use in the food trade (1). Softshell turtles are widely eaten and are also used in Chinese medicine kept as pets or released into temple ponds (2). Chinese have used turtle products for thousands of years but changes in the economy have resulted in a dramatic increase in the demand for luxury items such as turtles within the last 25 years (6).,The wattle-necked softshell turtle is listed on Appendix III of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) in China meaning that China has asked other countries for assistance in controlling the trade in this species (3). In addition in China there are numerous turtle farms breeding large numbers of wattle-necked softshell turtles. While this may have the benefit of lessening pressure on wild populations there are also a number of issues that need to be investigated further to ensure that turtle farms are not actually damaging wild populations. These issues include whether the breeding stock is replenished with wild individuals; and whether an increased availability of turtles through farming affects the demand for turtle products (6). A number of scientists have recommended that instead of attempting to adapt the farming industry for conservation purposes protected areas should be established to preserve the remaining wild populations (6). Should such measures not succeed the future survival of the wattle-necked softshell turtle may depend on those introduced populations in Mauritius and Hawaii (1).

Animalia,Western ruivaco ,Animalia,Chordata,Actinopterygii,Cypriniformes,Cyprinidae,Achondrostoma (1),Length: up to 11.9 cm (2)Weight : up to 26.5 g (2),The western ruivaco is threatened with pollution from industry agriculture and sewage plants (1) and is now found only in small isolated areas upstream of major pollution sources (3) (4). Summer droughts and the illegal removal of water for intensive agriculture has reduced the habitat of this threatened fish and had a major impact on its population (2).The surviving populations of the western ruivaco are very small (4) and it is thought that the population in the Safarujo may have been lost after the stream dried up (1).,There are currently no known conservation projects relating to the western ruivaco (1) (4) but there have been pilot captive breeding studies which could be useful if reintroductions become necessary (2). This study took a population of 16 adult western ruivaco from the Alcabrichel River for captive breeding (2) and showedencouraging results. Measures to restore the rivers inhabited by the western ruivaco have also been recommended to protect this highly threatened fish (4).
Animalia,Westfall’s knobtail ,Animalia,Arthropoda,Insecta,Odonata,Gomphidae,Epigomphus (1),,Westfall\u2019s knobtail is known from only two locations and much of its known range has been deforested with ongoing habitat loss posing a serious threat to the species (1).,There are currently no known conservation measures targeting this species but there is an urgent need to search for other subpopulations and to determine the extent of suitable habitat remaining in the general area (1).
Animalia,Wetar ground dove ,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Columbiformes,Columbidae,Gallicolumba (1),Length: 27 cm (2),The Wetar ground-dove population is estimated to be in the low thousands on Wetar and its tame nature and specialised habitat use places it under threat (6). Wetar is regarded as one of the most biologically intact islands in Indonesia but there is a strong push for development from both the Indonesian government and local inhabitants (6). Habitat loss from gold mining road construction timber logging and agricultural expansion represents a major threat in addition to hunting in lowland forest and climate change (6) (8).,Wetar has some of the most intact monsoon forest in Asia and is consequently home to large populations of a number of <strong>endemic</strong> bird species making conservation of this forest crucial. The Bekau Huhun Nature Reserve currently covers a large area in central-west Wetar; however the boundary does not yet extend to the Naumatang Gorge area where the Wetar ground-dove is locally common (6). In Timor there is a WWF initiative to extend the Gunung Mutis protected area in West Timor and designate the area a National Park and further areas important for the islands\u2019 <strong>endemic</strong> bird species have been identified (4).Several reserves have also been proposed in Timor-Leste to protect some of the remaining forest (8).

Animalia,White-edge freshwater whipray ,Animalia,Chordata,Chondrichthyes,Rajiformes,Dasyatidae,Himantura (1),Total length: 200 cm (2)Maximum weight: 8000 g (2),Like a number of other freshwater ray species the white-edge freshwater whipray is under threat primarily by habitat loss and degradation as habitat is cleared to make way for new residential and industrial sites. Where this building occurs in river catchment areas alteration to the water supply and flow can negatively affect the freshwater habitat of this species (5).,A conservation project was initiated by the Thai government in the 1990s consisting of a breeding programme to boost populations upstream of dams (1). However this was unfortunately put on hold in 1996 and no definite conservation measures for this species have been in place since (1).
Animalia,White-throated jungle-flycatcher ,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Muscicapidae,Rhinomyias (1),Size: 17 cm (2),The white-throated jungle-flycatcher is in grave danger of extinction due to widespread habitat destruction within its lowland range. Forest on Guimaras has long since been cleared leading to the species extinction on the island and continued deforestation for shifting cultivation charcoal production and lumbar extraction threatens what little remains on Negros and Panay (2) (4). Illegal logging and harvesting of forest products such as tree ferns and rattans has been a particular problem at Ban-ban Negros and in 1991 forest at the site was considered unlikely to last more than a few years (2).,The white-throated jungle-flycatcher occurs in the tiny (0.5\xa0km\xb2) Sampunong Bolo National Park and two proposed national parks on Panay one of which contains the largest block of remnant forest in the Western Visayas. On Negros populations have been recorded in recent years at Mt. Canlaon Natural Park although sadly it is thought little suitable habitat remains within this \u2018protected\u2019 site (2).

Animalia,Worthen’s sparrow ,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Emberizidae,Spizella (1),Size: 12.5 – 14 cm (2),Worthen\u2019s sparrow is dangerously close to extinction with just 100 to 120 individuals estimated to survive today. The species\u2019 range has greatly retracted due to habitat loss with open shrub-grassland having been widely destroyed by agriculture and grazing and it seems unlikely that large tracts of habitat remain near the two currently known sites (2).,The north side of the valley at Tanque de Emergencia is managed using a rotational grazing regime that ensures that the grass always remains high in several pastures preserving suitable habitat for Worthen\u2019s sparrow. It would greatly benefit this rare bird if such regimes were implemented elsewhere within its range (2).

As a result of the shiny cowbird\u2019s presence on the mainland the yellow-shouldered blackbird is increasingly nesting on offshore cays (6).,The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) have produced a recovery plan to help prevent further declines in the yellow-shouldered blackbird population. This involves creating artificial nests which are carefully monitored as well as trying to control the impact of shiny cowbirds and pearly-eyed thrashers on this species\u2019 breeding success (9).
Animalia,Yellow-throated apalis ,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Cisticolidae,Apalis (1),10 - 12 g (2),The yellow-throated apalis is considered fairly common within the areas it inhabits but it is classified as Endangered on the IUCN Red List because of its restricted range. Demand for timber and land for agriculture driven by a rapid increase in the human population of south-eastern Malawi has resulted in deforestation and therefore habitat loss within this species\u2019 range (3). Habitat loss is a serious threat to the yellow-throated apalis and is responsible for a continuing decrease in its population size (2).,All of the areas inhabited by the yellow-throated apalis are within forest reserves and are therefore legally protected. However this level of protection has not been sufficient to prevent habitat loss.

The human population in this remote corner of China has exploded in recent decades and forests are being cleared both for timber and to make way for agriculture (5). The populations of snub-nosed monkeys that remain are isolated in fragments of the former forest (8). Hunting of this primate was banned in China in 1975 but lack of funds and staff means that this law is hard to enforce and hunting persists (2). Monkeys are also accidentally trapped in snares set out for other wildlife (6).,The Government of China banned the hunting of snub-nosed monkeys in 1975 although this has proven difficult to enforce (2). Around half the population of the Yunnan snub-nosed monkey occurs within protected reserves such as Baima Snow Mountain Nature Reserve where wardens are trying to work closely with the local people to secure the future of this species (5). In 1998 a national logging ban on all remaining old-growth forests came into force which will help to preserve some of the monkey's precious habitat (5). Yunnan snub-nosed monkeys are a vital part of the mountain ecosystem preventing the accumulation of <strong>lichen</strong> in these ancient forests of the foothills of the Himalayas (5).

Animalia,Zapata wren ,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Troglodytidae,Ferminia (1),Length: 15.5 – 16 cm (2),The Zapata wren has always been confined to a tiny area which makes it particularly vulnerable to potential threats. At one point it was thought that the wren may be extinct as searches in the area it was first discovered were unsuccessful at finding any individuals. This was probably because the area had suffered extensive burning but fortunately further expeditions which searched areas further afield were then successful in rediscovering the Zapata wren (2). The burning of grass continues to pose a threat to the Zapata wren along with the drainage of wetlands in the region and the expansion of agriculture which destroys suitable habitat. The Zapata wren may also suffer from predation by introduced mongooses and rats (2) (4).,There are a number of protected areas within the Zapata swamp the main being Ci\xe9naga de Zapata National Park and the whole swamp has been declared an UNESCO Biosphere Reserve. However regulations in these areas are not always enforced (4). It has been proposed that surveys to determine the population size and range of the Zapata wren should be undertaken (4) and enforced protection of its habitat is likely to be greatly beneficial.

The Aeolian wall lizard is one of six European lizard species to be classified as Critically Endangered (CR) by the IUCN Red List meaning that these species face an extremely high risk of extinction in the wild (9).\xa0,The Aeolian wall lizard is listed on Annex III of the Bern Convention which aims to protect European species and their habitats (11). Although the area in which this species occurs is classed as a World Heritage Site the Aeolian wall lizard is not found in any formally protected areas (1).

Animalia,Alagoas foliage-gleaner ,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Furnariidae,Philydor (1),30 - 38 g (2),The Alagoas foliage gleaner has an extremely small population and a very restricted range. As a result of logging and the conversion of habitat for agriculture the area of forest at Murici in Alagoas the site of the Alagoas foliage-gleaner's discovery has declined by more than half since the 1970s. Furthermore the remaining habitat is highly fragmented. In Serra do Urubu in Pernambuco indiscriminate exploitation of natural resources especially for making charcoal has until recently been the main threat to the last remaining significant forest remnants (3) (5).,Despite being protected under Brazilian law the Alagoas foliage gleaner is facing the very imminent threat of extinction. Fortunately SAVE Brasil (formerly BirdLife International Brasil Program) is working to conserve habitat at both Murici in Alagoas and Serra do Urubu in Pernambuco. In 2001 international and national efforts led by SAVE Brasil resulted in the creation of the Murici Ecological Station in Alagoas. Covering over 6000 hectares of protected habitat work at Murici is currently overseen by seven conservation organisations that together with SAVE Brasil form the Muruci Pact (3) (5).

Animalia,Amani flatwing ,Animalia,Arthropoda,Insecta,Odonata,Megapodagrionidae,Amanipodagrion (1),,The Amani flatwing is now critically endangered due to destruction and degradation of its habitat (1). There has been almost complete destruction of low-altitude forest across East Africa mainly for conversion to agricultural land (3) and the few remaining forests of the Eastern Arc Mountains where this species is found are under considerable pressure (5). While the main viable subpopulation of Amani flatwings is relatively safe within the Amani-Sigi Forest Reserve any other subpopulations within the vicinity are either already extinct or on the verge of extinction as a result of human encroachment forest destruction and water pollution. Even the protected population leads a relatively precarious existence containing fewer than an estimated 250 mature individuals (1).,The Eastern Arc forests of Tanzania contain many endangered species found nowhere else on Earth but remain under serious threat from an encroaching human population and are in immediate need of conservation action (5). Fortunately the stream around which the one remaining viable population lives is protected within a forest reserve in the East Usambara Conservation Area and is therefore relatively safe from any immediate danger (3). Nevertheless any changes to this stream could result in the extinction of the species and it has been advocated that an extensive survey of the whole area is urgently needed to locate any further remaining populations (1).

Animalia,American burying beetle ,Animalia,Arthropoda,Insecta,Coleoptera,Silphidae,Nicrophorus (1),Length: 2.5 - 3.8 cm (2),American burying beetles have been lost from the majority of their former range; populations in the east had largely disappeared by the 1920s whilst the decline in the American Midwest was well documented in the 1980s (2). One of the major causes of this decline in abundance is the fragmentation of available habitat; leading to changes in the availability of carrion increased competition and the isolation of remaining popualtions (2). ,The precarious sate of the population of American burying beetles was recognised in 1989 when the species was listed as Endangered on the U.S. Fish &amp; Wildlife Service Endangered Species List (3). A Recovery Plan has been drawn up and searches for remnant populations are underway (2). In Rhode Island and Oklahoma the known populations are monitored and their habitats managed and in Massachusetts a number of beetles from a captive population at Boston University have been released (2).
Animalia,Amsterdam albatross ,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Procellariiformes,Diomedeidae,Diomedea (1),4.8 – 8.0 kg (2),This rare albatross has been imperilled by a number of human and non-human related activities and now clings to an extremely precarious existence of just 70 to 90 individuals and 10 to 20 annually breeding pairs (2) (7). A large herd of 1200 feral cattle have destroyed the vegetation cover at lower altitudes on Amsterdam Island reducing this species\u2019 available breeding ground. Introduced predators also pose a major threat particularly feral cats and Amsterdam Island has suffered from fires started by humans which destroy vegetation and possibly birds (2) (9). The effects of longline fisheries around the island in the 1970s and early 1980s may also be to blame for the serious decline in numbers (4) (10). Although population numbers have recently been increasing a continued decline is projected owing to the potential spread of certain diseases (Avian cholera and <i>Erysipelothrix rhusiopathidae</i>) that affect the Indian yellow-nosed albatross (<i>Thalassarche carteri</i>) population on the same island (1) (4). Indeed increased chick mortality over recent years suggests that the Amsterdam albatross population has already been affected (4).,The Amsterdam albatross is listed on Appendix I on the Convention on Migratory Species (CMS) which strives towards protecting migratory animals conserving or restoring their habitat and controlling factors that might endanger them (3). It is also on Annex 1 of the Agreement on the Conservation of Albatrosses and Petrels (ACAP) (11). All Amsterdam albatrosses are banded and the population is monitored every year. In 1987 the number of cattle was reduced and a fence erected to partition off part of the island and in 1992 a second fence was built to provide complete protection from cattle in the high plateau (4) (9). Access to the colony by humans is also now under strict control (2). Further proposals include the management of vegetation to increase suitable nesting ground investigation into the impact of cats and means of removing these predators raising awareness of <strong>bycatch</strong> problems amongst longline fishers and research into methods of preventing the spread of disease (4) (10). All these issues need to be urgently addressed if we are to ensure the future of this bird which is one of the rarest and most endangered of all albatrosses and currently in grave danger of extinction.
Animalia,Antiguan racer ,Animalia,Chordata,Reptilia,Squamata,Colubridae,Alsophis (1),Male weight: up to 122 g (2)Female weight: up to 760 g (2)Male length: up to 59 cm (2)Female length: up to 99 cm (2),This snake was once common in Antigua but by the twentieth century it had completely disappeared from the island and was thought to be extinct mainly as a result of the introduction of two species (4). Black and brown rats (<i>Rattus rattus</i> and <i>Rattus norvegicus</i>) were accidentally brought to the West Indies on foreign ships from Europe wreaking havoc on <strong>endemic</strong> wildlife including the Antiguan racer whose eggs and young were preyed upon (4). Then in the late 19th Century the small Indian mongoose (<i>Herpestes javanicus</i>) was introduced in an effort to control rat populations in sugar cane plantations. These quickly established themselves and systematically drove many species of terrestrial reptiles and ground-nesting birds to extinction or near-extinction amongst them the Antiguan racer (5). To make matters worse many Antiguans and visiting tourists wrongly believed the racer to be dangerous and snakes were often killed on sight (3).,In 1989 the believed extinct Antiguan racer was rediscovered on Great Bird Island where it was indeed facing imminent extinction. By 1995 only about 60 racers survived and most had been severely injured by rats (3). A conservation initiative sprang into action to save this species; Fauna and Flora International the Antigua Forestry Unit the Island Resources Foundation the Durrell Wildlife Conservation Trust the Environmental Awareness Group and Black Hills State University joined forces to create the Antiguan Racer Conservation Project (2). This award-winning project led to the eradication of rats and mongooses from Great Bird Island and 11 other offshore islands an extensive study programme and a very active education initiative for local people and visiting tourists (2).

Animalia,Arabian leopard ,Animalia,Chordata,Mammalia,Carnivora,Felidae,Panthera (1),Head-and-body length: 1.3 m (2)Male weight: 30 kg (4)Female weight: 20 kg (4),The Arabian leopard clings to a desperately precarious existence. With an official estimate of probably no more than 250 mature individuals and a declining trend this cat edges ever closer to the jaws of extinction (6). Habitat loss poses a serious threat largely as the result of overgrazing by livestock (2) which has also contributed to the depletion of the leopard\u2019s prey base (7). Hunting of both the leopard and its prey has also had a dramatic impact on the cat\u2019s survival contributing to it becoming one of the rarest animals in the world today (4). The leopards in Yemen are under particular pressure from hunting persecution from local shepherds and capture for trade (7) threats that are thought to be the main contributors to the species\u2019 demise (8). Sadly significant conflict arises from many people considering the leopard to be a threat to their domestic stock (8) with leopards probably often being blamed for kills by wolves and unexplained livestock losses (9).,Fortunately the situation is much more hopeful in Oman than in Yemen with the leopards of the Dhofar Mountains benefiting from comprehensive conservation measures (8). The first significant step to conserve the Arabian leopard was taken in 1985 when the region\u2019s first captive breeding group was established at the Omani Mammal Breeding Centre in Muscat (8). Since then captive breeding efforts at a number of institutions have been successful with several cubs born at the Breeding Centre for Endangered Arabian Wildlife in Sharjah United Arab Emirates. Such captive breeding programmes are essential in maintaining genetic diversity and saving this species from extinction (4). Nevertheless these successes need to be matched by equal successes in conservation efforts <glos><i>in-situ </i></glos>(2) without which potential reintroductions into the wild would be destined to fail (6).
Animalia,Araripe manakin ,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Piridae,Antilophia (1),Length: 14.5 cm (2),Although the threats facing this species are not yet fully known it is thought that habitat loss and degradation as a result of human encroachment for development and recreation as well as clearance for agriculture (particularly banana maize beans and tomatoes) and cattle is the main threat (2). The chapada region has suffered intense human pressure recently and the locality at which the species was first described has been turned into a recreational park. The species does still occur in the area but the effects of the resulting influx of humans is unknown (4).,The location at which this beautiful bird is found is within the Araripe National Forest and a larger Environmental Protection Area but these designations do not prevent disturbance or exploitation (2). It is imperative that this area is designated as a biological reserve or a national park (2). Thankfully the owner of the land next to the type locality resolved to protect the habitat after this species was discovered. A project supported by the British Petroleum Conservation Leadership Programme is underway to shed light on the ecology of this species and to assess the main threats facing it as well as opportunities for its conservation (4). Urgent action must be taken if this critically endangered and recently discovered species is to escape extinction (2).

Animalia,Baer’s pochard ,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Anseriformes,Anatidae,Aythya (1),Length: 41 - 46 cm (2),Shockingly surveys have shown that around half of the total wintering wildfowl of the middle and lower basins of the Yangtze River were killed each year by hunters through netting shooting and poisoning. This indiscriminate loss of birdlife impacts not only on those birds that are already deemed to be under threat but all other birds in the area. Whilst some <i>Aythya</i> species are not as vulnerable as the Baer\u2019s pochard hunters are usually unable to distinguish between them anyway and so cannot spare those individuals that may prove to be so important in maintaining a viable population of Baer\u2019s pochard. Eggs are also collected from nests and as well as the obvious drop in reproductive output this causes the breeding grounds become less suitable as a result of the disturbance causing other nests to be abandoned (4).,Killing this species is banned in Mongolia Hong Kong Myanmar and some provinces in China but the large-scale hunting methods used and the difficulty in distinguishing Baer\u2019s pochard from other duck species notably from the similar ferruginous duck (<i>Aythya nyroca</i>) make it difficult to enforce the laws. This and many other waterfowl species would benefit from a ban on the spring shooting of ducks in Russia and the creation of more protected areas in addition to those Baer\u2019s pochard already uses. The education of hunters as to the identification of threatened species may help and it is important that Baer\u2019s pochard is upgraded to become a nationally protected species in mainland China and is put on Schedule I of the Wildlife Act of India (4).

Animalia,Banded neolebias ,Animalia,Chordata,Actinopterygii,Characiformes,Citharinidae,Neolebias (1),Length: up to 18 mm (2),Despite the absence of any immediate threats to the banded neolebias its low abundance and highly limited range mean that it may be highly susceptible to future pressures. Although the region is still relatively undisturbed Sianda creek and parts of Kataba creek have already been developed into canals reducing habitat availability for the fish. As the local human population increases it is likely that intensified agriculture will lead to pollution of the banded neolebias\u2019s habitat from fertilisers and herbicides. Deforestation will also be likely in the area surrounding the floodplain causing various negative effects on the local ecosystem (1).,There are currently no measures in place to protect the banded neolebias. However various strategies have been proposed including further study of its biology assessments of its population and analysis of its threats. In addition the creation of a protected area encompassing its range continual population monitoring and prevention of invasion by the Nile tilapia have been recommended (1). The banded neolebias is a tiny fish with no economic value (4) nevertheless as a unique component of Zambia\u2019s biodiversity its preservation is important.
Animalia,Banggai crow ,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Corvidae,Corvus (1),Length: 39 cm (2),Based on the small number of records for this species and the rapid rates of habitat loss within its range the Banggai crow is likely to have only a very small population (2). Unfortunately it remains hunted by local residents of Peleng Island (5).,Following its rediscovery conservation efforts are being undertaken to protect the Banggai crow and its forest habitat promoting sustainable agriculture and possibly eco-tourism as well as educating local people about the bird\u2019s plight (2) (5).

Animalia,Bekko tombo ,Animalia,Arthropoda,Insecta,Odonata,Libellulidae,Libellula (1),,Once relatively abundant bekko tombo populations have undergone drastic declines in recent decades as a result of habitat destruction and degradation and introduced predators. Ponds have been filled to allow urban expansion or in some urban areas ponds have been made into artificial ponds with concrete banks which may be unsuitable for this species. Likewise grassy fields which females and immature males rely upon for refuges have greatly diminished in recent years (1). Introduced alien species such as <i>Procambarus clarkii</i> (Crustacea) <i>Micropterus salmoides</i> (carnivorous fish) and <i>Myocastor coypus</i> (a large semi-aquatic rodent) have also contributed to the dragonfly\xe2\x80\x99s demise either through direct predation or through feeding on the water plants that sustain this native species (1) (5). Sadly the pattern of decline is only expected to continue (1).,Considered a national natural treasure in Japan (5) the bekko tombo became protected by the Japanese Ministry of Environment in 1993 and collection is prohibited by law (1). Nevertheless this does little to protect the dragonfly\xe2\x80\x99s disappearing habitat (1). Thus some <strong>NGOs</strong> have begun to conserve this insect and its habitat at specific pond sites for example at Okegaya Imuta Misumi and Noyori-shin ponds (1) (6). At Misumi Pond the Oita Dragonfly Society is feeding and breeding the larvae of bekko tombo to help restore the diminished population with 149 larvae successfully hatching in spring 2005 in tanks installed in the pond. The Oita Dragonfly Society is also observing the mating and egg-laying behaviour of females with the hope that the information gained will help them in their breeding scheme (6). Thus despite an ongoing decline national pride in this native dragonfly provides an element of hope for its future in Japan at least through inspiring concerted conservation efforts by dedicated individuals and organisations such as the Oita Dragonfly Society.

As only one population of <em>Belgrandiella bachkovensis</em> is known it is extremely vulnerable. Pollution from upstream agriculture has previously caused damage to its habitat and therefore poses a major threat to this species (1) (2).,There are no known specific conservation measures currently in place for <em>Belgrandiella bachkovensis</em>. Pollution management could be enforced to help protect its population and future monitoring of the habitat is needed to maintain its quality (1).

Animalia,Black abalone ,Animalia,Mollusca,Gastropoda,Archaeogastropoda,Haliotidae,Haliotis (1),Length: 20 cm (2),The black abalone has suffered a serious decline since 1985 due to a disease known as withering syndrome which spread through the California Channel Islands between 1985 and 1992. It causes wasting of the foot muscle preventing the abalone from properly adhering to a rock causing the abalone to become discoloured lose weight and die. Population losses in each area ranged from 20% to total (1).,All abalone fisheries in California are managed by the California Department of Fish and Game which restricts the size of abalones caught and the season in which harvesting can take place. In Mexico there is a total allowable catch limit for black abalones. The black abalone is a candidate species on the US Endangered Species Act and whilst this could be beneficial in the future it does not currently give the species any legal protection (1).

Animalia,Black-eared mantella ,Animalia,Chordata,Amphibia,Anura,Mantellidae,Mantella (1),Length: 15 – 18 mm (2),As for many Madagascan frogs the threats to this species are serious and numerous. Having suffered massive over-collection for the pet trade in the past the black-eared mantella is now threatened by habitat loss due to increasing subsistence agriculture timber extraction charcoal manufacture livestock grazing fires human settlement and the spread of introduced eucalyptus species (1). Current studies are in act to provide a revised distribution map of the species. The abundance at some of these sites appears anyhow high enough to warrant the survivorship of the species (4).,For this species to persist trade must be carefully regulated. The black-eared mantella is currently listed on Appendix II of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species which bans trade without an export permit. It is not found in any protected habitat and deforestation is now the most serious threat (1).
Animalia,Black-faced lion tamarin ,Animalia,Chordata,Mammalia,Primates,Callitrichidae,Leontopithecus (1),540 – 710 g (2),Habitat loss as a result of development cultivation and the increase in tourism in the area as well as the capture of live individuals has posed a threat to the survival of the species (6).,The black-faced lion tamarin project aims to study the species and gather information on its ecology and behaviour (7). Findings will be used to inform conservation management programmes and raise awareness of the species through environmental education in the local area. Captive breeding programmes could also help this species enormously and are a priority for future conservation efforts (2). This tamarin is one of the world's 25 most endangered primates and is on the very brink of extinction. It will require long-term conservation efforts and protection if it is to survive.

Animalia,Brazilian merganser ,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Anseriformes,Anatidae,Mergus (1),Size: 49 â 56 cm (2),The Brazilian merganser is extremely sensitive to habitat loss and degradation and has suffered badly from pollution siltation and disturbance of its rivers which has resulted largely from deforestation logging agricultural expansion cattle ranching human habitation hotel construction and in the Serra da Canastra area diamond-mining (3) (4) (7). Dam-building has also flooded suitable habitat especially in Brazil and Paraguay (4) and intensifying ecotourism activities such as rafting may become another threat in the future (3). Other threats include inbreeding hunting competition forest fires egg-collecting pesticides and predation (7). Fewer than 250 birds are thought to remain in the world with the vast majority in Brazil. In Argentina where very few individuals survive and extinction may be imminent hunting and collection of exhibition specimens is believed to have contributed to the species\xe2\x80\x99 decline (4).,This extremely rare bird occurs in three Brazilian national parks and in Argentina sections of the Arroyo Uruz\xc3\xba are also protected within the Urugua\xc3\xad Provincial Park (4). Commercial diamond extraction was banned in the Serra da Canastra area in Brazil in 1996 (7). A Brazilian Merganser Recovery Team has been set up and a Brazilian Merganser action plan has been created which details priority conservation projects (8) (9). In line with these plans the Brazilian NGO Terra Brasilis has initiated a conservation program the world\xe2\x80\x99s most important site Serra da Canastra National Park in South Central Brazil (8) (9). The programme involves collecting basic information needed to adequately protect the species such as studies of its breeding ecology and an inventory of its distribution within the Canastra range as well as environmental education in both urban and rural areas (schoolchildren teachers farmers and other local people) and a campaign to market the species presence with the aim of ultimately making it a flagship species for the region (9). Nevertheless even despite these efforts there is a very real possibility of extinction in the wild becoming a reality and without being established in captivity this rare species would be lost to the world forever.

Animalia,Cape stag beetle ,Animalia,Arthropoda,Insecta,Coleoptera,Lucanidae,Colophon (1),,Collectors appear to pose the greatest threat to this enigmatic group of beetles (4) (6). The Cape stag beetles are amongst the most highly prized beetles on the market (7) with complete sets of <i>Colophon</i> species fetching upward of $10000 and even single specimens of the rarest species being advertised at several thousand dollars (3). Four Germans have recently been caught having captured 211 of these beetles (5). Other threats include habitat damage and loss infrastructure development (such as mobile telephone masts) inappropriate fire regimes human disturbance climate change and over-collection by researchers (4). These threats are exacerbated by the small range occupied by this genus and their suspected low reproductive rate (4).,All <i>Colophon</i> species were given provincial legal protection in 1992 which served to limit legal collection internal trade and export from the province (7) (3). Their listing on Appendix III of CITES also controls import and export of the species across South Africa\xe2\x80\x99s borders (2). These laws appear to be fairly rigorously enforced with the four Germans recently caught with over 200 of these rare beetles fined almost \xc2\xa310000 (5). In 1994 it was proposed that <i>Colophon</i> beetles be upgraded to Appendix I of CITES but the proposal was ultimately withdrawn (7). The upgrade of <i>Colophon</i> beetles to Appendix I would certainly help their chances of future survival and should be seriously considered in the ongoing objective to protect these rare <strong>endemic</strong> beetles.

Animalia,Cave catfish ,Animalia,Chordata,Actinopterygii,Siluriformes,Clariidae,Clarias (1),Length: 16.1 cm (2),The cave catfish is found only within a single cave in Namibia and is therefore at inherent risk of extinction due to any chance event. The main threat to the species comes from the depletion of ground water within the cave and the exploitation of aquifer water may pose the most serious threat in the long-term (3).,The protection of the Aigamas Cave is vital in the conservation of this species and the present owner is sympathetic to the sensitivity of the cave only allowing access or collection of the cave catfish with a Nature Conservation Permit (3). Twenty captive specimens were held in the National Zoological Gardens' aquarium in Pretoria for several years (3) but no longer persist (7). There is also a move to provide legislative protection for this rare and unique fish (3).

Animalia,Cherry-throated tanager ,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Thraupidae,Nemosia (1),Head-body length: c. 14 cm (2),Human settlers began clearing Brazil\u2019s Atlantic forests in the 16<sup>th</sup>century when European explorers established along the coastline. Forests were initially cut down for timber and later to make room for the rapidly expanding cattle ranches and sugar plantations. The rate of deforestation increased dramatically in the 19<sup>th</sup>and 20<sup>th</sup>centuries due to rapid population and economic growth and an increased demand for charcoal and firewood. The legacy of such a destructive history is that tragically today less than 10 percent of the Atlantic forest remains. Consequently many of the species within this region are seriously threatened with extinction (6) (7). One such species the cherry-throated tanager now has a critically small population probably no more than 250 individuals and a very patchy distribution (2). The future of this rare species is threatened by further loss to what little habitat remains through urban and agricultural encroachment and timber extraction (4) (8).,The survival of the Critically Endangered cherry-throated tanager is perilously bound to the future management of two privately owned forests in which the last remaining populations are found (2) (3) (4). Thankfully however since 2004 SAVE Brasil has been working with the government and local organisations and communities to ensure the conservation of the forests on which the cherry-throated tanager depends to survive. As a result of these efforts in June 2010 the government of the state of Esp\xedrito Santo created ten Ecological Corridors including the Cherry-throated Tanager Corridor which are recognised as\xa0crucial areas for the state\u2019s biodiversity. These areas are to be prioritised for future conservation work with plans to reconnect remnant forest patches through <strong>afforestation</strong> and restoration work and the promotion of sustainable activities and soil management (9).

Animalia,Chile Darwin’s frog ,Animalia,Chordata,Amphibia,Anura,Cycloramphidae,Rhinoderma (1),Male snout-vent length: 31 mm (2)Female snout-vent length: 33 mm (2),The causes of the Chile Darwin\u2019s frog precipitous decline and subsequent disappearance are not well understood. It is thought that habitat loss through the planting of plantations and residential development may have had some impact whilst climate change and possibly disease might have caused declines in existing areas of suitable habitat (1) (3).,Urgent survey work is vital to determine whether the Chile Darwin\u2019s frog still survives. In addition suitable habitat for this species needs to be surveyed to determine whether amphibian pathogens such as the chytrid fungus (not previously reported in Chile) are present in the area. Given the threat of disease it would likely be necessary to establish an <strong>ex-situ</strong> population if surviving individuals are ever discovered (1) (3).

Animalia,Corroboree frog ,Animalia,Chordata,Amphibia,Anura,Myobatrachidae,Pseudophryne (1),Length: 2.5 - 3 cm (2),There has been a recent decline in this previously abundant species which has now been lost from as much as 68% of its former range (5). The unusual life cycle of the corroboree frog makes it particularly vulnerable; only one small clutch is laid in a year and tadpoles have a long development time (4). The precise causes of this sudden decline are unclear but a number of factors may be involved including habitat destruction by ski resort development and trampling by humans and livestock (6). However it is now widely accepted that chytrid fungus is a major (if not the primary) cause of their continuous decline (9).,A Recovery Plan for the corroboree frog has been published by the National Parks and Wildlife Service of New South Wales (5). This plan identifies the urgent need for more population data and investigation into the cause of the continuing decline in numbers. Research into captive breeding techniques will also be undertaken (5). In the short term the plan aims to halt the precipitous decline of this species and then work to restore this colourful frog to much of its former range (5).
Animalia,Cozumel thrasher ,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Mimidae,Toxostoma (1),49 – 60 g (2),Once thought to be a common bird on Cozumel Island the Cozumel thrasher suffered significant declines after hurricane Gilbert tore through the island in 1988 and only three individuals were found in the following seven years. After another hurricane in 1995 no thrashers were found in annual surveys until an individual was discovered in 2004 (2). The devastating effect of hurricanes remains a primary threat to any remaining small population. However it is believed other threats must have contributed to the decline of this species as it is likely to have survived hurricanes for millions of years. Introduced predators especially boas which were released onto the island in 1971 may have had a significant impact on Cozumel thrashers (4). Whilst large areas of forest remain on Cozumel Island the ubiquitous threat of human development and associated habitat loss and degradation is likely to increase pressures on this critically endangered species (3) (4).,Research is currently underway on the Cozumel thrasher in a project funded by the American Bird Conservancy and Conservation International (4). Surveys are urgently needed to determine whether this species still persists and an investigation into its ecology would provide further explanation for its decline and help identify suitable conservation actions (2) (5). The Cozumel thrasher is at great risk of imminent extinction but hopefully there is still the chance to pull it back from the brink.

Animalia,Cromwell chafer ,Animalia,Arthropoda,Insecta,Coleoptera,Scarabaeidae,Prodontria (1),Length: 15 - 16 mm (2)Width: 8.5 mm (2),The original range of the Cromwell chafer was around 500 hectares but this was reduced to just 100 hectares following the construction of the Clyde Dam and the expansion of the township of Cromwell (4).  Threats facing this species are not fully understood but are thought to include predation by introduced hedgehogs (<i>Erinaceus europaeus</i>). The little owl (<i>Athene noctua</i>) is also known to predate upon this species (3). Habitat alteration is also likely to be a problem (2). At the present time large areas of apparently suitable habitat are not occupied by this beetle. It is imperative that the reasons for its present distribution and the factors limiting the population are understood (3).,The site supporting this species has been fully protected since it became a nature reserve in 1983. Research and monitoring of the Cromwell chafer populations are on-going and current work is focusing on the predation risk posed by hedgehogs and other predators potential competitors and understanding the life history of the species (3). Hopes are that the knowledge gained from these studies will help to develop and guide the effective conservation of this unique and very rare beetle.

Animalia,Delta green ground beetle ,Animalia,Arthropoda,Insecta,Coleoptera,Carabidae,Elaphrus (1),Length: 6 mm (2).,The historical distribution of the delta ground beetle is unknown but it is thought reasonable to assume that the species was once found throughout the wetlands and grasslands of California\u2019s Central Valley (4). The area has suffered widespread disruption and destruction of its wetland habitat from agricultural development tapping of vernal pools for irrigation of crops river channelisation and encroaching urban development all of which are thought to have played a role in the demise of this species (2) (4). Additionally an introduced alien plant garden lippia (<i>Phyla</i> spp.) poses an immediate threat to the species\u2019 remaining range. The plant forms dense mats in vernal pools crowding out native vegetation and hindering the beetle\u2019s foraging (2). Only around 75 individuals have been seen since 1974 and the species\u2019 small range places it in very serious danger of extinction (4).,The delta green ground beetle is protected by the Lacey Act which prohibits its import export transport sale purchase receipt or acquisition (4). The beetle is also protected through its occurrence in the Jepson Prairie Reserve (5) but other suitable sites nearby are on private land and negotiations over their protection are ongoing (2). Since its life cycle is intricately intertwined with the seasonal changes of its vernal pool habitat conservation of the delta green ground beetle very much depends upon the protection of this habitat which is itself endangered (2). Thus protection of this disappearing habitat must be the top priority in the conservation of not only the delta ground beetle but also the array of other endangered species that are unique to and depend heavily upon this threatened vernal pool ecosystem.

Thus habitat loss is likely to play an important role in the decline of the dracula\xa0ant as it has with many of the island\u2019s other endemic fauna.,Entomologist Dr. Fisher of the California Academy of Sciences who first discovered an entire colony of dracula ants in 2001 has moved a few colonies into a laboratory environment (6). This not only allows the species to be studied in greater depth but also serves as a buffer against total extinction. Indeed it is feared that these relics of an earlier stage of evolution may disappear from the wild completely in less than a decade (6).

Animalia,Dwarf olive ibis ,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Ciconiiformes,Threskiornithidae,Bostrychia (1),Length: 60 – 65 cm (2),The historical clearance of much of Sao Tom\xe9\u2019s lowland forest for sugar cane and cocoa plantations undoubtedly had a catastrophic impact on the dwarf olive ibis\u2019s population (2) (5) (6). While today large-scale clearance for plantations has mostly stopped (2) (5) forest clearance for small farms continues and there is also the possibility that exploitation of <strong>primary forest</strong> for timber and firewood will increase dramatically in the future (5). In addition this species is severely affected by hunting and predation from introduced mammals such as the mona monkey (<i>Cercopithecus mona</i>) African civet (<i>Civettictis civetta</i>) and weasel (<i>Mustela nivalis</i>) (2). With its population estimated in 2007 to be between 50 and 249 individuals the combined effects of these threats are rapidly pushing the dwarf olive ibis towards extinction (2).,There are currently no conservation measures in place for the dwarf olive ibis. While various organisations have proposed that this species and its habitat should be given protected status this has yet to occur (2) (6). Without intervention this unique species found nowhere else in the world could disappear forever (2).
Animalia,Eastern gorilla ,Animalia,Chordata,Mammalia,Primates,Hominidae,Gorilla (1),Male height: up to 1.7 m (2)Female height: up to 1.5 m (2)Male weight: 160 kg (2)Female weight: 90 kg (2),Snares set to trap other wildlife may accidentally maim and even kill gorillas (6) while poaching for infants has re-emerged as a threat to mountain gorillas (1). The biggest threats to Grauer\xe2\x80\x99s gorillas result from armed conflict in and around the parks. In the past decade many Grauer\xe2\x80\x99s gorillas have been shot dead in crossfire or for food by people hiding in the forest. Ongoing instability in the region means that this problem is getting worse as civil war has made arms more accessible and continues to create large numbers of refugees (7). A relatively new threat to the gorillas comes from the tourism. While tourism has so far aided its survival large numbers of people coming into close contact with gorillas may put them at risk from human diseases (7).,The mountain gorilla occurs mainly within national parks and in some areas is protected by armed guards to prevent poaching (7). Gorillas in the Virunga region have been studied and protected for many decades and are now seen as an important source of tourist revenue (8). The United Nations Environmental Programme (UNEP) has recognised the urgent need to protect our closest relatives and has established a Great Ape Survival Project (GRASP). This project is aimed at identifying the conservation initiatives required to secure the future of the apes and at obtaining political support and funding to allow these to be achieved (9). A multifaceted approach is needed to ensure the survival of one of our most impressive cousins.
Animalia,Eastern long-beaked echidna ,Animalia,Chordata,Mammalia,Monotremata,Tachyglossidae,Zaglossus (1),Adult weight: 4.2 – 9.1 kg (2)Juvenile weight: 3.2 – 5.1 kg (2),Intensive hunting undertaken by local people for food combined with a loss of habitat due to the conversion of suitable land for cultivation has pushed the eastern long-beaked echidna into a precarious position (1).\xa0Now classified as Critically Endangered the key populations of this species are now restricted to the highest parts of New Guinea\u2019s mountains (1).\xa0Further threats may arise in the future as a proposed nickel mine to be built in the next 10 to 15 years will lie in an area which is home to an important population of this species (1).\xa0,Few conservation measures are currently in place to protect this highly threatened species. It has been recorded from a few protected areas (1) and is listed on Appendix II of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) which means that any international trade in this species should be carefully monitored (3). Further measures are certainly needed such as hunting regulations and field studies to identify areas in which this species occurs for which protection is critical (1).\xa0\xa0

Animalia,Elkhorn coral ,Animalia,Cnidaria,Anthozoa,Scleractinia,Acroporidae,Acropora (1),,Staghorn corals face the many threats that are impacting coral reefs globally. At present around one third of the world's reef-building corals are threatened with extinction. The principal threat to corals is the rise in sea temperature associated with global climate change. This leads to coral bleaching where the symbiotic algae are expelled leaving the corals weak and vulnerable to an increasing variety of harmful diseases. Climate change is also expected cause more extreme weather incidents and to increase ocean acidification which impairs the coral's ability to form a skeleton. These global threats are compounded by localised threats from pollution destructive fishing practices invasive species and human development (6).,Staghorn corals are listed on Appendix II of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) and therefore trade in this coral should be carefully regulated and a permit is required to bring the coral or objects made from them into the countries that have signed the CITES convention (2). Staghorn corals will also form part of the marine community in many marine protected areas or in areas where management plans are in place to protect the coral community. In some areas coral reefs restoration attempts are being undertaken; in Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary efforts have been made to reattach coral fragments or culture and settle coral larvae. Both activities have had limited success and new techniques are being pursued (5).

Animalia,Ethiopian short-headed frog ,Animalia,Chordata,Amphibia,Anura,Microhylidae,Balebreviceps (1),Snout-vent length: up to 5.3 cm (2),Although reported to be fairly numerous at the site from which it was first recorded in 1986 the Ethiopian short-headed frog is thought to be restricted to a relatively small area and its habitat may be declining (1). The increasing human population in the Ethiopian Highlands is putting pressure on the land through agricultural development and overgrazing (2) (5) and although direct damage to the narrow belt of giant heath occupied by this frog is not thought likely in the near future any such damage would pose a significant threat to the species (1). Indirect effects of the logging of adjoining forests at slightly lower elevations may also threaten the Ethiopian short-headed frog (1) while other factors such as climate change and disease may present future problems (6).,The Ethiopian short-headed frog occurs within the Bale Mountains National Park although this area has yet to be officially gazetted (1) (2) (5). Conservation priorities for this unique and little-known amphibian include the protection of <em>Erica</em> heath and woodland and further survey work to better understand the species\u2019 ecology status and distribution (1).

Animalia,Floreana coral ,Animalia,Cnidaria,Anthozoa,Scleractinia,Dendrophylliidae,Tubastraea (1),,Thought to once have been fairly widespread around the Gal\xe1pagos Islands since the <strong>El Ni\xf1o</strong> event of 1982-83 this coral has only been found at Cousins Rocks and Gardner Islet and despite searches specifically for this species Floreana coral has not been seen at Cousins Rocks since 2001 (1).    This suggests that Floreana coral populations suffered mortalities as a result of the <strong>El Ni\xf1o</strong> event and it is therefore likely that any other alterations to the water temperatures surrounding the Gal\xe1pagos Islands such as global climate change will also threaten this coral (1).,The unique biodiversity of the Gal\xe1pagos Islands and the surrounding waters is recognised and valued and thus the region is protected by being designated a Marine Reserve and World Heritage Site (1).  Floreana coral is also included in Appendix II of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) meaning that any international trade in this species should be carefully regulated (2).  Unfortunately neither of these measures protects this Critically Endangered coral from the threats of natural or man-induced climate change.

Animalia,Galapagos land snail ,Animalia,Mollusca,Gastropoda,Stylommatophora,Bulimulidae,Bulimulus (1),,Since its colonisation in 1920 the human population on Santa Cruz has multiplied dramatically leading to the decline of suitable habitat for land snails as farming and road and house construction grew (1) (2). In addition habitat alteration and introduced species of plants and animals are also thought to have had a negative impact (1) (3).,There are currently no conservation measures targeting this species.
Animalia,Giant ibis ,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Ciconiiformes,Threskiornithidae,Thaumatibis (1),Length: 102 – 106 cm (2),Continuing deforestation and wetland drainage for agriculture has led to widespread habitat loss for the giant ibis although much suitable but unoccupied habitat still remains. This suggests that hunting and human disturbance may be the most serious threats to the giant ibis (2).,The giant ibis gains official protection from its presence in Xe Pian National Biodiversity Area in Laos and in Lomphat Wildlife Sanctuary Cambodia. Both Laos and Cambodia are running a campaign to reduce the hunting of large water birds and the giant ibis is illustrated on public awareness material. Surveys to monitor the giant ibis\u2019 population and distribution have been proposed as well as research to discover their breeding habits and requirements (2). The creation of further protected areas has been recommended (2) and captive breeding will be considered. Crucially gun ownership must be further controlled following the success of such schemes in Laos (4).

Animalia,Golden white-eye ,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Zosteropidae,Cleptornis (1),Length: 14 cm (2),In the past 20 years this species has gone from being of no conservation concern to the brink of extinction (1). An expanding human population has undoubtedly had an impact on the species (7) despite its ability to persist in a range of habitats (2). Between 1982 and 2007 the human population on Saipan quadrupled resulting in development of much more of the island. During this period of the 11 land bird species found on Saipan the golden white-eye and two other species decreased in number (7).,The Mariana Avifauna Conservation Project aims to protect birds in the Mariana archipelago from the brown tree snake by forming populations of the native bird species via a captive breeding programme (6). Between 2007 and 2008 46 golden white-eyes were taken into captivity with the aim of initiating captive breeding in the near future (2). The continued control of brown tree snakes through trapping is an essential component of any conservation plan if this rare bird is to survive (2). \xa0
Animalia,Gorgeted puffleg ,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Apodiformes,Trochilidae,Eriocnemis (1),Male total length: 9.7 – 9.9 cm (2)Male tail length: 3.5 – 3.8 cm (2)Male wingspan: 6.2 cm (2)Male weight: 3.9 - 4.5 g (2),Upon discovery in 2005 the population of the gorgeted puffleg was estimated to be very small partly due to it having only ten square kilometres or less of suitable habitat remaining. Since then the population is likely to have declined further as around eight percent of <strong>cloud forest</strong> in Serran\xeda del Pinche is degraded every year by agriculture primarily for the cultivation of coca (<em>Erythroxylum coca</em>) (2) (3).,Local authorities the Ministry of Environment The Hummingbird Conservancy Ecohabits Foundation and local residents are all working together on an ongoing conservation plan which aims to protect the habitat of the Serran\xeda del Pinche and promote local conservation and education initiatives (2). Further studies to determine the population size and status of the gorgeted puffleg along with the creation of a protected area within the Serran\xeda del Pinche have been proposed (3).

The campaign is further promoted by local artists and musicians who have made the Grenada dove the subject of songs colourful paintings and billboards with the intention of encouraging local participation in the protection of the dove (3). The Grenada dove also features on Grenadian stamps reinforcing the dove\u2019s significance as a national symbol (2).

Animalia,Hemicycla ,Animalia,Mollusca,Gastropoda,Stylommatophora,Helicidae,Hemicycla (1),Length: 24 - 28 mm (2),The natural ecosystems of Gran Canaria are highly deteriorated a situation which has had negative impacts on a variety of <strong>endemic</strong> species (4). Habitat loss has drastically reduced the range of <em>Hemicycla saulcyi</em> and the species is now restricted to a small isolated population occupying a total area of under four square kilometres (2) (4) (5) (6). Most of La Isleta is an old military base which has so far prevented encroachment by the city of Las Palmas de Gran Canaria. However this base is being closed and the likely increase in building and development in the area could be disastrous for this species (2) (5) (7). A further potential threat may come from the spread of introduced snails which are believed to compete with the <strong>endemic</strong> snail species potentially displacing them from some areas (4). Predation by rats mice and lizards may also be a problem (3).,No species of land snail in the Canary Islands currently receives direct legal protection and therefore indirect protection through preservation of its habitat will be all the more vital to both <em>Hemicycla saulcyi</em> and other threatened <strong>endemic</strong> snails (2) (4) (7). It has been recommended that the north-western part of La Isleta be made a Special Nature Reserve in order to prevent building and development in the area. A Recovery Plan has also been recommended to promote the restoration of the natural vegetation (2) (4). With only around thirty living specimens of <em>Hemicycla saulcyi saulcyi</em> observed to date the total population may be tiny (2) (6) and without adequate protection the future for this highly endangered <strong>mollusc</strong> is uncertain.

Animalia,Indochinese box turtle ,Animalia,Chordata,Reptilia,Testudines,Bataguridae,Cuora (1),carapace length: 19 cm (2),Freshwater turtles in South East Asia face a number of threats principally habitat alteration and human exploitation. Forests are being cleared and watercourses altered in the process of cultivating the land for human use which is often achieved at the detriment of the turtles' natural habitat (6). Another major threat to the survival of this species comes from the pet trade; between 1989 and 94 almost 33000 specimens of the genus <i>Corus</i> (Asian box turtles) were imported into the United States (6). An additional threat may come from the increasing demand for turtles for food and medicines especially in China (6).,More information is urgently needed on the distribution and behaviour of this shy box turtle. The Indochinese box turtle is listed on Appendix II of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) (3) but trade remains one of the key features of its decline. More data on distribution of this species is vital if a comprehensive conservation plan is to be established.
Animalia,Itatiaia highland frog ,Animalia,Chordata,Amphibia,Anura,Strabomantidae,Holoaden (1),Snout-vent length: up to 3.7 cm (2),This small frog was previously described as being very abundant at the site from which it was first described (2) and was frequently found up until the 1970s (1). However it has now not been seen in the wild for more than ten years despite extensive searches leading to fears that it may already have become extinct (1). The species has not been recorded outside of one small area of less than ten square kilometres and is believed to have declined due to a reduction in the extent and quality of its habitat as a result of touristic activities and fire. The species is also reported to be affected by extreme frosts (1). It is not known to what extent the Itatiaia highland frog may also have been impacted by factors such as climate change disease and pollution which are presenting great threats to amphibian species worldwide (7).,The range of the Itatiaia highland frog lies within the Parque Nacional do Itatiaia (1) and the species has been listed as Critically Endangered in Brazil (8). Extensive surveys are needed to determine whether this rare amphibian still survives in the wild and if it is found urgent conservation measures will be needed to save the remaining individuals including a conservation management plan and the continued conservation and preservation of its habitat (1).

Animalia,Ivory-billed woodpecker ,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Piciformes,Picidae,Campephilus (1),Size: 48 – 53 cm (2),The ivory-billed woodpecker was known from the southeastern United States and Cuba. Logging mining plantations and other forms of exploitation have swept away the once extensive tracts of pristine forest that were home to this woodpecker. Logging of the mature forests that form its habitat was probably the major cause of the disappearance of this species (2). Although incredible recent discoveries have provided new hope for both the U.S. and Cuban <strong>subspecies</strong> previously considered extinct the ivory-billed woodpecker is nevertheless clinging on to an extremely precarious existence.,Searches for the elusive ivory-billed woodpecker in the mountains of southern Cuba and in the U.S. continue. If sightings are confirmed the implementation of effective protection measures will be vital for the future of this fascinating bird (2).

Animalia,Junín grebe ,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Podicipediformes,Podicipedidae,Podiceps (1),Length: 33 – 38 cm (2),Being restricted to only one lake makes the Junin grebe extremely vulnerable to any changes in the lake. Changes to Lake Junin have resulted in the decline of the grebe from over 1000 in 1961 to probably around 200 individuals in 2007 (5) (7). In addition to this general decline population numbers also fluctuate according to the water level of the lake (7). The Upamayo Dam as part of a hydro-electric plant regulates the water level of Lake Junin creating fluctuations in the water level that can cause nearly half the lake\u2019s surface to dry up including important nesting and foraging areas for the grebes (3) (6) (8). As no young are raised when water levels are very low this regulation has a significant negative impact on the Junin grebe. However the greatest threat it faces and what will ultimately lead to its extinction if not halted is pollution of the lake from mining waste. Waste waters from surrounding mines in the area enter the lake causing water pollution and an accumulation of iron oxides in the lake sediments. The sedimentation of iron oxides causes large parts of the lake bottom to become lifeless and therefore much of the offshore area is no longer adequate feeding habitat (3) (9).,Lake Junin was designated a National Reserve in 1974 which has limited hunting and fishing in the lake but has had no affect on the primary threats of mining and dam-building activities (5). In 1999 Lake Junin was declared to be in a state of emergency resulting in the formation of a committee which implemented an environmental management plan (8). This involves further protection of the lake restrictions on the extraction of water and provisions for its cleaning (5). However much work is still required to prevent further pollution of the lake and restore the habitat. Continuing pollution will inevitably lead to the extinction of the Junin grebe unless a \u201creserve\u201d population is established in another location. <strong>Translocation</strong> of the Junin grebe to a lake north of Lake Junin was attempted but unfortunately the use of gill-nets to fish trout in this lake made it unsuitable (7). In 1997 the IUCN Grebe Specialist Group created a Global Conservation Strategy to ensure the successful recovery of grebe populations and the management of wetlands (9). Particular conservation actions recommended for this species include carrying out studies of other lakes to identify suitable locations for further <strong>translocation</strong> attempts as well as taking steps to prevent pollutants from entering Lake Junin and to de-toxify lake sediments (9).
Animalia,Kanab amber snail ,Animalia,Mollusca,Gastropoda,Stylommatophora,Succineidae,Oyloma (1),Length: 14 - 19 mm (2)Width: 7 - 9 mm (2),Changes to the Kanab amber snail\u2019s habitat are thought to be the main reason explaining why this beautiful species has become endangered. In Arizona high water discharges from the Glen Canyon Dam situated upriver from the Grand Canyon National Park results in snails being swept downstream and the loss of suitable habitat (2) while in Utah the Kanab amber snail population is at risk due to the alteration of its habitat by a private landowner (2) (3).,The Arizona Game and Fish Department and the National Park Service have attempted to establish a new wild population of Kanab amber snails in Grand Canyon National Park. In September 1998 snails were taken from Vasey\u2019s Paradise and introduced to three natural springs in areas which would not be affected by dam operations. Further individuals were <strong>translocated</strong> in July 1999 to boost population densities and improve <strong>genetic variation</strong>. Since that initial stocking in 1998 a population seems to have established at one site the Upper Elves Chasm (3). It is hoped that the successful establishment of this additional wild Kanab amber snail population in Arizona will greatly aid in the conservation of this rare species (3).

Animalia,La Palma giant lizard ,Animalia,Chordata,Reptilia,Squamata,Lacertidae,Gallotia (1),Snout-vent length: up to 44 cm (2),The decline in the La Palma giant lizard population is believed to be mainly due to the arrival of humans to the Canary Islands (1) (2). As well as using this species as a source of food humans also introduced other predators of the La Palma giant lizard including cats and dogs (1) (2).,The La Palma giant lizard is believed to be potentially extinct with a sighting of this species in 2007 remaining unconfirmed (5) (6). If this species does still survive the remaining population is likely to be extremely small totalling less than 50 mature individuals. It is not known if this species occurs in any protected areas (1).

Animalia,Largetooth sawfish ,Animalia,Chordata,Chondrichthyes,Rajiformes,Pristidae,Pristis (1),c. 500 kg (3),Once common in the Mediterranean and the Eastern Atlantic the largetooth sawfish has now been <strong>extirpated</strong> from the Mediterranean and European waters and populations in Africa are believed to be severely depleted (2). Similarly in Lake Nicaragua where this species used to be abundant the largetooth sawfish barely continues to exist (3). These distressing declines have been largely due to over-fishing and the degradation of important estuarine and freshwater habitats (5). The largetooth sawfish is hunted for its unique and peculiar blade-like snout fins and meat. It is also captured for public aquaria where it is highly prized for exhibits (5). Incidental capture in fisheries also poses a significant threat as its toothed saw makes this fish especially prone to getting entangled in fishing nets (2) (5). Characteristics of the sawfish\u2019s life history such as slow growth rate poor rate of reproduction and high age of maturity make the largetooth sawfish extremely vulnerable to over-exploitation and unable to easily recover from low numbers (5).,The largetooth sawfish is listed on Appendix I of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) meaning that international trade in this species is prohibited except in exceptional circumstances (4). Besides this listing there are currently no conservation measures in place for this species and it is believed that without urgent intervention there is a high probability that the largetooth sawfish will become extinct (2).

Animalia,Major black millipede ,Animalia,Arthropoda,Diplopoda,Spirostreptida,Spirostreptidae,Doratogonus (1),,The single tiny forest area in which the major black millipede occurs is under threat from the extraction of wood by the local community for fuel and building and its population is also likely to be small putting it at increased risk of extinction (1).,The Gwaliweni Forest is managed by KZN Wildlife although wood extraction there continues (1). No specific conservation measures are known to be in place for the major black millipede and despite having an important role in ecosystems as nutrient recyclers (5) <strong>invertebrates</strong> such as millipedes tend to be overlooked in conservation policies (2) (7)\xa0with less than half of South Africa\u2019s <strong>invertebrates</strong> even officially named (2). Some efforts are underway to collate information on these species such as the Green Trust Database of Threatened South African Invertebrates (2) and such initiatives will be important in improving the conservation of species such as this little-known millipede (1).

Animalia,Mangrove finch ,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Emberizidae,Camarhynchus (1),18 g (3),With a declining population of less than 100 adult birds (3) and a breeding range of around one square kilometre (5) the mangrove finch\u2019s situation is critical. The exact cause of this species\u2019 decline is unclear but natural factors such as the <strong>El Ni\xf1o</strong> cycle introduced species and human activities may all be involved (2). As a result of introduced predators such as black rats cats and the smooth-billed ani preying on eggs and chicks and high levels of nest infestation by the blood sucking parasite <i>Philornis downsi</i> causing the death of nestlings the mangrove finch\u2019s breeding success is low (2). Concerted conservation action is necessary if this species is to be saved from extinction.,For over a decade the Charles Darwin Foundation (CDF) has been working to conserve the mangrove finch (2). At present extensive research is being conducted to better understand this species\u2019 breeding biology and to determine the causes of its decline (2) (5). In the meantime active protection of the remaining breeding populations is being employed through predator and nest parasite control (5). Despite these measures the mangrove finch remains extremely vulnerable due to its limited range. In order to address this the CDF and the Durrell Wildlife Conservation Trust are currently working together towards a captive breeding and <strong>translocation</strong> programme. If successful their efforts will help to ensure a future for this remarkable species (5) (7).

Animalia,Medium tree-finch ,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Emberizidae,Camarhynchus (1),Length: 12.5 cm (2),The medium tree-finch used to be found on the coast but is now restricted to the highlands (4) as a result of the extensive habitat destruction and degradation on Floreana caused by agriculture and free-ranging livestock. Introduced predators such as cats dogs and rats also pose a threat (2). The introduction of diseases such as avian pox may also potentially threaten finches. A population of the large ground finch has already become extinct on Floreana which illustrates the vulnerability of finch species to such threats.,The majority of the Galapagos archipelago forms part of the Galapagos National Park a World Heritage Site. A management plan is in place for the islands and the Ecuadorian government and non-governmental organisations are working to conserve the unique biodiversity of the Galapagos (5) all of which will help ensure the future of this species. More specifically scientists at the Charles Darwin Research Station are working to improve our understanding of Darwin\u2019s finches to ensure their conservation. This includes monitoring of populations and investigating introduced diseases (3). However in 2009 the IUCN upgraded the medium tree-finch from Vulnerable to Critically Endangered in light of its tiny range on a small island and indications of a rapid decline in the species due to the effects of a parasite <i>Philornis downsi</i> (2).

Animalia,Mindoro bleeding-heart ,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Columbiformes,Columbidae,Gallicolumba (1),Length: 27 cm (2),Mindoro\u2019s forests have been devastated by human activities such as logging cultivation and rattan collection and the bleeding-heart\u2019s habitat has now been almost entirely eradicated (3).  Populations in the remaining small forest patches continue to face intense pressure from deforestation and trapping (2).  In addition the beautifully patterned plumage of the Mindoro bleeding-heart makes it a target for trapping for domestic and export pet trade (2) and it is also hunted for food (3).,The Mindoro bleeding-heart was last recorded in 1991 in Sablayan the largest remaining patch of lowland forest but there have been more recent unconfirmed reports by local people from two other areas (5).  It may be afforded a little protection in the Mount Iglit-Baco National Park and hunting has been prohibited around Mount Malasimbo (3).  Thorough surveys of all these areas are urgently needed to clarify the Mindoro bleeding-heart\u2019s current distribution and if any surviving populations are discovered studies to determine its ecological requirements would help inform conservation actions (3) (5).  The protection of two key sites at which the bleeding-heart is believed to occur Mount Halcon and Lake Naujan is also likely to benefit this critically endangered bird (3).

Additionally introduced species such as the cane toad (<em>Bufo marinus</em>) cats foxes pigs and goats have all been found to impact on crayfish populations (1) (2) (3).,The Mistake Mountains crayfish\u2019s range falls entirely within the bounds of the Mount Mistake National Park which may afford this species some level of protection. However there are currently no specific conservation measures targeted at the Mistake Mountains crayfish (1) (3).

Animalia,Montserrat oriole ,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Icteridae,Icterus (1),Length: 20 - 22 cm (2),Confined to hill forests on the small island of Montserrat the Montserrat oriole is believed to have formerly had a total range of around 30 square kilometres (7). However volcanic eruptions between 1995 and 1997 destroyed around two-thirds of its habitat all but removing this species from the Soufri\xe8re and South Soufri\xe8re hills and largely restricting it to just the Centre Hills. Initial surveys suggested that much of the population had survived the eruptions with healthy numbers remaining in the Centre Hills and a smaller relict population in the South Soufri\xe8re hills. But between 1997 and 2003 the population declined very rapidly (2) (3). The exact cause of this decline is unknown but potential agents include ash fall on the forest causing insect availability to decrease or chronic ill health of birds (2).\xa0,Since the devastating volcanic eruption that almost caused the extinction of this striking species the Montserrat oriole has been the target of much research and management. In June 1999 eight birds were taken to Jersey Zoo to enable the development of husbandry techniques. Initial attempts at captive breeding proved successful and captive birds are now also present at several other locations in the UK (2).\xa0

Animalia,Namdapha flying squirrel ,Animalia,Chordata,Mammalia,Rodentia,Sciuridae,Biswamoyopterus (1),Head-body length: 405 mm (2),This little-known flying squirrel has a very restricted range and is currently known from only one location (1). Like other restricted-range species this makes it particularly vulnerable to any threats which could rapidly affect all individuals in the population. The Namdapha flying squirrel is presently threatened by habitat loss and degradation (1) caused by clear-felling for human settlements shifting agriculture and the extraction of non-timber forest products particularly the leaves of a rattan palm <i>Zalacca secunda</i> for use as a roofing material (5).,The Namdapha flying squirrel occurs within Namdapha National Park in Arunachal Pradesh (4). Despite the protection of this large area it is still affected by human activities such as those mentioned above. The Namdapha National Park contains not only the Critically Endangered Namdapha flying squirrel but is also home to populations of other threatened species including tigers (<i>Panthera tigris</i>) snow leopards (<i>Uncia unicia</i>) and Asian elephants (<i>Elephas maximus</i>). The effective protection of the Namdapha National Park is therefore incredibly important but this is also an incredibly difficult aim to achieve. This is not only due to the park\u2019s inaccessibility the lack of legal enforcement and shortage of well-trained and equipped personnel but also due to the local people\u2019s dependence on the forest and the materials it provides. This means that any conservation measures require local people\u2019s participation to be successful (5).

Animalia,Negros bleeding-heart ,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Columbiformes,Columbidae,Gallicolumba (1),Size: 30 cm (2),Like the four other bleeding-heart species that occur in the Philippines the Negros bleeding-heart is greatly threatened by the destruction of its habitat.  In 1988 only four percent of forest cover remained on Negros and Panay held on to just eight percent of its forest.  This alarming loss is due to the clearance of forest for agriculture timber and charcoal-burning and these activities remain a serious threat to the remaining fragments of forest.  The effect of this devastating habitat destruction is aggravated by local trapping and hunting of the Negros bleeding-heart for food and presumably for the cage-bird trade (1).  As a result of these threats the extremely small population of Negros bleeding-hearts (estimated to be between 50 and 249 individuals) is still declining (4) which makes it extremely vulnerable to extinction.,Despite the precarious status of the Negros bleeding-heart there are very few specific conservation measures in place.  It occurs within the Mount Canlaon Natural Park on Negros and possibly also in the North Negros Forest Reserve.  However the North Negros Forest Reserve receives virtually no protection at present (7).  On Panay it occurs in the North West Panay Peninsula which was proclaimed a Protected Area in 2001.  Forest Rangers of the Philippine Endemic Species Conservation Project (PESCP) patrol this area and the northern part of the Central Panay Mountain Range destroying snares and curbing illegal logging.  PESCP also ran an Airgun-for-Rice programme as an intervention against hunting in the region; a large number of airguns were destroyed as a result of the programme (5) (10).

Animalia,New Zealand black stilt ,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Charadriiformes,Recurvirostridae,Himantopus (1),220 g (2),The massive decline and retraction in range of the black stilt is mainly attributed to the introduction of mammalian predators to New Zealand such as cats ferrets and stoats (6). In the Mackenzie Basin ongoing large-scale rabbit control programmes since the 1940s may have forced feral cats to switch to hunting native birds instead (3). Habitat modification has also contributed to the decline of this species (1); a massive hydroelectric scheme in the basin has considerably altered the natural habitat (7). Today mammalian predators still represent the major threat to the continued survival of this species along with <strong>hybridisation</strong> with the closely related Australasian pied stilt which successfully colonised New Zealand subsequent to European settlement in the 1800's (6). Since the 1970's the small remnant breeding population of black stilts has been restricted in range to the Mackenzie Basin where it has been intensively protected and managed (5). If numbers continue to fall <strong>hybridisation</strong> will become an even bigger problem as individuals find it harder to find mates within their own species.,Since the mid-1900's pure black stilts have numbered fewer than 100 individuals; in 1999 numbers fell as low as 40 only 9 of which were females (6). Since the 1970's intensive predator control protection and manipulation of wild nests and captive breeding and release programmes have been the only factors preventing this species from becoming extinct in the wild (5). The New Zealand Department of Conservation set out a new Kak\xef Recovery Plan in 2001 (3) in a concerted effort to save this species. Phase one of the plan aims to increase numbers in the wild through captive rearing and release programmes along with predator control measures (3). The second phase of the Recovery Plan aims to identify the causes of breeding failure in the wild (3). Recent improvements in release techniques have increased the initial survival of released birds to as much as 80 to 100 percent and these are encouraging results (6) although factors that inhibit recovery remain.

Animalia,Palila ,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Drepanididae,Loxioides (1),Length: 19 cm (2),The sub-alpine forest occupied by the palila has been severely over-browsed by sheep and goats and palila nests are preyed upon by feral cats introduced rats and the short-eared owl (<i>Asio flammeus</i>). It is thought that introduced grasses suppress the regeneration of the palila\u2019s main food source the mamane as well as increasing the risk of fire. The spread of feral pigs is also expected to suppress mamane regeneration (2).,The recent removal of sheep and goats from Mauna Kea\u2019s slopes has allowed some mamane regeneration but re-colonisation of suitable habitat is proving more difficult than expected (2). The palila will return to its home range following human intervention (7) as was found when several pairs were <strong>translocated</strong> in 1993 (2). A larger <strong>translocation</strong> was attempted in 2002 to test whether a more natural social environment and a larger pool of potential mates might encourage the <strong>translocated</strong> birds to remain in their new area. Several captive breeding programmes have been implemented with some early successes (2).

Animalia,Pan's box turtle ,Animalia,Chordata,Reptilia,Testudines,Bataguridae,Cuora (1),,Many of the Asian turtles including Pan's box turtle are severely threatened by the over-collection of both adults and eggs. The popularity of turtle meat once considered a luxury increased dramatically in the 1990s due in part to growing economies across Asia. This market has decimated native populations which are unable to sustain the demand and coupled with habitat loss has pushed many species to the brink of extinction (6).,In recognition of the precarious state of the population of Pan's box turtle the World Conservation Union (IUCN) classifies this species as Critically Endangered (1). International trade is restricted by the listing of this turtle of Appendix II of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) (2) but further research is desperately needed before more effective conservation measures can be put into place.

Animalia,Philippine crocodile ,Animalia,Chordata,Reptilia,Crocodylia,Crocodylidae,Crocodylus (1),Male length: up to 3 m (2),The massive population decline of the Philippine crocodile was originally caused by excessive over-exploitation for commercial use (2). Today habitat destruction is the most pressing threat to species survival with rainforests being cleared throughout the region to make way for rice fields in an effort to cope with the human population explosion (2). Locals in this area are also in contact with the infamous esturine or 'saltwater' crocodile (<i>Crocodylus porosus</i>) which is one of the largest reptiles in the world and has a reputation as a man-eater. This factor undoubtedly contributes to local intolerance of any crocodile species even the small Philippine crocodile which is often killed when encountered (5). The very word for 'crocodile' in the Filipino language is a vile insult (7).,Next to the Chinese alligator (<i>Alligator sinensis</i>) the Philippine crocodile is considered to be the most endangered crocodilian in the world. Some authorities believe there may be less than 100 individuals left in the wild (3) although some wild habitat still remains. Urgent research is needed to assess the current status in order to implement an effective management strategy for this remaining wild population (3). This species is protected from international trade by its listing on Appendix I of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) but there is only one officially protected area within the Philippines and this is poorly enforced (3). At present captive breeding takes place in a small programme run by the Silliman University and at the government-run Crocodile Farming Institute which breeds crocodiles for commercial and conservation reasons (3). Sadly there is currently little political will or local tolerance to save this ancient reptile in the wild and for the short term at least captive breeding programmes may be the key to the at least nominal survival of this crocodile (3).

Animalia,Pink velvet worm ,Animalia,Onychophora,Onychophora,Onychophora,Peripatopsidae,Opisthopatus (1),Length: up to 40 mm (2),The Ngele Forest in which the pink velvet worm lives was heavily logged in the early 1900s after a private sawmill was built nearby in 1891 (1). The remaining forest is patchy and continues to be destroyed as exotic plantations are planted around and right up to the edges of the indigenous forest the harvesting of which is greatly disruptive to the forest (1). Timber plantations are also associated with a high level of invasion by alien plants. The construction of a national road through Ngele Forest has fragmented habitat and potentially populations of the pink velvet worm.,Although a permit is required to collect any animals from the province and some degree of habitat protection has been given by the State access to the area where this species occurs remains relatively uncontrolled (1). Future conservation measures advocated include a publicity campaign to raise awareness of the species and further research on population numbers range and biology of the species (1). Fortunately five specimens are currently thriving in captivity in Hamburg providing the opportunity to study their life cycle reproduction and feeding behaviour (6). Although this captive population safeguards the survival of the species for the time being more needs to be done to protect the pink velvet worm\u2019s diminishing restricted habitat if this ancient unusual and elusive species has any chance of surviving in the wild.

Animalia,Polynesian ground-dove ,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Columbiformes,Columbidae,Gallicolumba (1),Size: 25 cm (2),Although the Polynesian ground-dove was once hunted by local people for food it is more likely that the main reason for its decline and local extinction on several islands is the introduction of cats and rats particularly the black rat <i>Rattus rattus</i> (2) (4). Cyclones storms and habitat loss are also likely to have had a significant impact with the largest atolls with the richest vegetation having been cleared for coconut plantations (2) (4).,Several surveys have been conducted on islands in the Tuamotu Archipelago (2) including an expedition by MANU (BirdLife in French Polynesia) sponsered by the BP Conservation Programme (5). A follow-up expedition by the BP Conservation Programme was planned for 2000 to 2001 to initiate protection measures and management plans to conserve the Polynesian ground-dove (2) (5). These plans included conducting important research into the ecology of the bird protecting its habitat from human disturbance raising local awareness of the species and initiating a captive breeding programme on Tahiti to safeguard the species from extinction. Introduced predators would also be eradicated from a suitable nearby island with the aim of translocating ground-doves there (5).

Tragically this is no longer the case as many of the species within this family are now extinct and those that remain including <em>Samoana burchi<strong> </strong></em>face a similar fate (6).,Captive breeding colonies of <em>Samoana</em> species have so far been unsuccessful. The current conservation of <em>Samoana burchi</em> is therefore limited to its management and protection in the wild (1).

Animalia,Red wolf ,Animalia,Chordata,Mammalia,Carnivora,Canidae,Canis (1),20 - 35 kg (4),The population of red wolves suffered as a result of persecution and habitat loss as mature woodlands were cleared to make way for agriculture (9). Red wolves were extensively trapped and shot as they were believed to pose a direct threat to livestock and game (5). <strong>Hybridisation</strong> posed a further threat to the survival of the species as the population became increasingly fragmented; isolated individuals would crossbreed with the closely related coyote (<i>Canis latrans</i>) (10). The taxonomic status of the red wolf has been widely debated. Recent genetic and morphological research suggests that the red wolf is a unique species rather than the hybrid offspring from gray wolf (<i>Canis lupus</i>) and coyote (<i>Canis latrans</i>) <strong>interbreeding</strong> (5) (11).,Despite the ongoing debate as to the species status of the red wolf the recovery programme initiated by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service is one of the most successful large mammal conservation efforts (9). Steps to save this much-maligned species began in 1967 and culminated in the <strong>re-introduction</strong> of captive-bred individuals into the wild. Four pairs of red wolves were released in North Carolina starting in 1987 (10). A second attempt in the Great Smoky Mountains National Park in Tennessee was conducted between 1992 and 1998 but was cancelled due to the inability of wolves to establish home ranges within the park and extremely low pup survival caused by diseases from domestic dogs (4). The North Carolina population is currently doing well an amazing feat considering the species was at one time extinct in the wild. The species is fully protected within the current range (12) but educational programmes around the release areas are essential in ensuring public support and success of the <strong>re-introduction</strong>. Public opinion surveys continue to show that local regional and national support for the program is favourable (4).

Animalia,Royal cinclodes ,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Furnariidae,Cinclodes (1),50 g (2),The royal cinclodes is under severe threat from the loss and degradation of <em>Polylepis</em> woodland which is now scarce and fragmented occupying only a fraction of its original cover. Heavy grazing and the uncontrolled use of fire have degraded understorey moss cover and prevented <em>Polylepis</em> regeneration whilst cutting of trees for timber firewood and charcoal production have further reduced available habitat (2) (3) (4) (6) (7) (9). As a result of this widespread habitat loss the royal cinclodes has been reduced to tiny subpopulations and may number fewer than 250 birds in total (2) (4) (7).,The royal cinclodes occurs in a number of protected areas including Madidi and Cotapata National Parks in Brazil (2) (4) and the Historic Sanctuary of Machu Picchu in Peru a World Heritage Site (10). A number of conservation programmes are also underway or have been proposed for the species including projects working with local communities to conserve <em>Polylepis</em> woodland; further research into the species\u2019 status ecology and distribution; environmental education and awareness campaigns; and efforts to improve land-use management (3) (4) (7). A project run by the American Bird Conservancy and the Asociaci\xf3n de Ecosistemas Andinos (ECOAN) is also aiming to restore <em>Polylepis</em> woodland and establish community protected areas covering this vulnerable habitat whilst also undertaking sustainable development projects that will benefit local people (9) (11). Despite its perilous situation these conservation efforts may go some way towards providing a brighter future for the royal cinclodes and recent records of this rare bird several hundred kilometres outside of its known range have given new hope that it may be more widespread than previously believed (4) (7) (8).

Animalia,Russian sturgeon ,Animalia,Chordata,Actinopterygii,Acipenseriformes,Acipenseridae,Acipenser (1),65 - 115 kg (2),The Russian sturgeon faces many serious threats to its survival. Vast areas of <strong>spawning</strong> ground have been lost due to the damming and exploitation of river systems throughout its range and pollution in the Caspian and Black Sea basins is causing devastating hormonal imbalances and a greater number of <strong>hermaphroditic</strong> individuals (1) (8).,Although there is a restricted sturgeon fishing season and a license to fish is necessary in most of the countries within its range the Russian sturgeon remains largely un-protected in most of the areas in which it occurs. For example the absence of a strict monitoring system makes controlling fishing very difficult. Iran has banned private sturgeon fisheries but in general conservation measures are either absent weak or ignored (1).

Animalia,Santa Catalina Island rattlesnake ,Animalia,Chordata,Reptilia,Squamata,Viperidae,Crotalus (1),Snout-vent length: 68 cm (2),Once thought to be a common species the Santa Catalina Island rattlensnake has suffered declines primarily due to the killing and illegal collection of individuals; unfortunately its reported passive behaviour makes it an easy target (1).  On Santa Catalina Island \u2018pit fall\u2019 traps have been found and people have been seen collecting reptiles in bags.  In addition predation by feral cats and a decline in the Santa Catalina Island rattlesnake\u2019s main prey the deer mouse may pose a threat to this now Critically Endangered species (1).,There are currently no conservation plans in place for this highly threatened reptile.  Like many other snakes this species may receive less conservation attention than it deserves due to long-standing and fairly widespread negative attitudes towards snakes (4).  The implementation of a program to control the population of feral cats on the island has been suggested as a measure to help secure the survival of this rare and fascinating snake (1).

The precise cause of this dramatic decline is unclear; it has been speculated that introduction of the predatory barn owl (<i>Tyto alba</i>) and declines in insect availability resulting from use of pesticides may be involved (3). However the recent discovery of a second roost near marshes on Silhouette showed that the bats here feed on different insects than those eaten by roosts that forage in palm woodlands elsewhere (4). It has therefore been argued that this variability in the diet demonstrates that food is not a limiting factor for the species and the decline in the species may rather be attributable to habitat alteration caused by invasive plants obstructing roost entrances (4).,The Nature Protection Trust of the Seychelles has monitored the known population of Seychelles sheath-tailed bats since 1997 (5) (6). As with other bats the protection of roosts and foraging habitat are of great importance. Existing roosts must be preserved not only from human disturbance but also from introduced plant species that smother the cave entrances (4). To this end one roost site had the invasive Kudzu vine <i>Pueraria phaesolides</i> cut back from its entrance in 2001 and 2004 and ongoing management aims to completely remove the species from the area (4). It is hoped that removal of invasive creepers from existing and abandoned roost sites will help to increase the desperately low numbers of this critically endangered bat to more sustainable levels.

Further changes to the climate caused by human activities may result in even greater reductions in the available habitat for this species (1).,The Sinai baton blue occurs entirely within the St Katherine Protectorate where rangers are monitoring this species by carrying out 9 to 14 survey days each year (7). Recent conservation efforts for the Sinai baton blue are mainly focused on preserving its endangered host plant with the Protectorate recently banning the collection of Sinai thyme with enforced fines. A fence has also been erected around a patch containing the largest butterfly population to prevent public access and stop further plant loss. Two dams have been built in this patch to hold more water in the soil and improve the condition of the thyme (1) (8).

Animalia,Spotted handfish ,Animalia,Chordata,Actinopterygii,Lophiiformes,Brachionichthyidae,Brachionichthys (1),Length: 10 - 15 cm (2),The spotted handfish was common in the lower Derwent River estuary until the mid 1980s when the species underwent a catastrophic decline (2). Although unproven it is thought that the introduction of the northern Pacific seastar (<i>Asterias amurensis</i>) to Tasmania at this time may be the key to the decimation of the handfish population (3). These seastars are voracious predators of shellfish and it is thought that they may also eat the eggs of handfish or the sea squirts upon which the eggs are attached (2). The deterioration of coastal habitats due to development may also be involved in the decline (3). This species is under added threat from its vastly reduced population limited dispersal restricted distribution and low reproductive rate (3).,Just two spotted handfish were reported between 1990 and 1994; this dire state of the population led to the formation of the Spotted Handfish Recovery Team in 1996 (3). The Recovery Team consists of a number of government agencies concerned with saving this rare and bizarre fish. Research into existing wild populations and the development of captive breeding techniques are some of the priorities of the recovery plan (3). Initial work has been encouraging with successful breeding attempts from two adult pairs of spotted handfish at the Tasmanian Department of Primary Industry and Fisheries Aquaculture (2). A captive population may be used in a future <strong>re-introduction</strong> programme to restore these fish to some of their previous range (6).

Animalia,Staghorn coral ,Animalia,Cnidaria,Anthozoa,Scleractinia,Acroporidae,Acropora (1),,Staghorn corals face the many threats that are impacting coral reefs globally. At present around one third of the world's reef-building corals are threatened with extinction. The principal threat to corals is the rise in sea temperature associated with global climate change. This leads to coral bleaching where the symbiotic algae are expelled leaving the corals weak and vulnerable to an increasing variety of harmful diseases. Climate change is also expected cause more extreme weather incidents and to increase ocean acidification which impairs the coral's ability to form a skeleton. These global threats are compounded by localised threats from pollution destructive fishing practices invasive species and human development (6).,Staghorn corals are listed on Appendix II of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) and therefore trade in this coral should be carefully regulated and a permit is required to bring the coral or objects made from them into the countries that have signed the CITES convention (2). Staghorn corals will also form part of the marine community in many marine protected areas or in areas where management plans are in place to protect the coral community. In some areas coral reefs restoration attempts are being undertaken; in Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary efforts have been made to reattach coral fragments or culture and settle coral larvae. Both activities have had limited success and new techniques are being pursued (5).

Today however the islands of Jolo and Sanga-sanga have been almost completely logged and have consequently suffered the local extinction of the Sulu hornbill (5). Logging in Tawitawi has also caused the deleterious decline of the species in its final stronghold. Hunting has also been a major cause of the destruction of this species; nestlings are collected annually for food and adults are reportedly shot on site either for food or target practice (5). The tiny population of Sulu hornbills that remain is on the verge of extinction; political unrest in the region continues to hamper conservation efforts (2).,The Sulu hornbill does not currently occur within any protected areas (4) and is in grave danger of disappearing before it has been properly studied. Research into the life history and biology of this rare bird are urgently needed along with survey work and protection measures (2). The Sulu hornbill is listed on Appendix II of the Conventional on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) and the Mindano State University have carried out some public awareness campaigns (5). Time is running out however and the Sulu hornbill may soon receive the dubious accolade of being the be the first hornbill to become extinct in the 21st Century (5).

Animalia,Taita apalis ,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Cisticolidae,Apalis (1),10 - 12 g (3),Most of the original forest of the Taita Hills has now been lost either to cultivation or to plantations of non-native timber trees. The Taita apalis is thought to be confined to just five of the remaining tiny isolated forest fragments and these fragments are still under serious threat from agriculture plantations firewood extraction and cattle grazing which may prevent natural regeneration (2) (3) (5) (7) (8). Although now protected a lack of clear boundary demarcations can make it difficult to effectively conserve these forest fragments and wildfires are also a threat in some areas (2). This highly endangered bird was believed to number no more than 600 to 930 individuals in 2001 (2) (6) (7) and its population is fragmented into tiny isolated subpopulations (2) putting it at increased risk of extinction. Alarmingly surveys in 2009 and 2010 indicated a major crash in the remaining population with possibly only 60 to 130 birds now remaining although the causes of this dramatic decline are unclear (4). As it lives close to the maximum altitude within its range climate change is a potential threat as it could leave the Taita apalis with nowhere to move to if local conditions change (2).,Fortunately for the Taita apalis a range of conservation activities are now underway in the Taita Hills. The remaining forest fragments are being safeguarded by the Kenya Forest Department while Nature Kenya is committed to conservation in the area (2). An international research project is ongoing which includes studies into the Taita apalis (2) (9) and conservation actions include reforestation plans to reconnect forest patches and the development of alternative income-generating activities such as bee-keeping and butterfly-rearing. Local farmers have also been taught about responsible agricultural practices and tree nurseries have been established to provide native trees for restoring degraded habitat and fast-growing non-native trees to create buffer zones and to reduce pressure on the native forest (2) (6) (7).

Animalia,Valencia toothcarp ,Animalia,Chordata,Actinopterygii,Cyprinodontiformes,Cyprinodontidae,Valencia (1),Female length: 71 mm (2)Male length: 67 mm (2),The population of the Valencia toothcarp has undergone a decline of more than 80 percent in the past 10 years which is mainly attributable to the introduction of a non-native species but also as a result of habitat loss and degradation (1) (7). In the early 20th century the eastern mosquitofish <i>Gambusia holbrooki</i> was introduced to the <strong>Iberian Peninsula</strong> in order to control malaria. The fish were not only successful in preying upon the mosquito larvae found in the wetland water bodies but were also more efficient at foraging than the native Valencia toothcarp. The invasive fish were therefore able to out-compete the Valencia toothcarp for resources during periods of scarcity and have promoted the native species\u2019 decline (7). This has been compounded by the increasing habitat loss and degradation predominantly fuelled by the fact that the Valencia toothcarp\u2019s range is a popular tourist destination. Many areas of this species\u2019 wetland habitat have been drained to make way for development and to reduce mosquito breeding grounds (3) while the remainder are affected by urban and agricultural pollution (1). At present the Valencia toothcarp is perilously close to extinction with just ten wild populations of which only five have favourable conservation status (2),The Valencia toothcarp is listed in the Annexes II and IV of the European Union Habitats Directive and in the Appendix II of the Bern Convention both of which require that efforts are made to protect this species and its habitat (1). In order to fulfil this requirement three European action programmes have been developed to create a reserve network within this the Valencia toothcarp\u2019s range. In addition since 1993 extensive reintroductions have been carried out restocking regions from which this species was previously extirpated. Nevertheless further protection is still required for the remaining wild populations along with the continuation of reintroductions and implementation of educational programmes to raise awareness of this threatened species\u2019 plight (2).
Animalia,Vancouver Island marmot ,Animalia,Chordata,Mammalia,Rodentia,Sciuridae,Marmota (1),3.0 - 6.5 kg (4),Natural <strong>successional processes</strong> are probably responsible for the original scarcity of the Vancouver Island marmot through tree encroachment in the alpine meadows it inhabits. The main causes of the recent severe decline are thought to be the disruption of the habitat due to logging activities weather fluctuations and increases in deer numbers which can cause an influx of predators. (4).,The Vancouver Island marmot gained legal protection under the British Columbia Wildlife Act in 1980 and a recovery team was set up in 1988 to devise a Recovery Plan (2). A captive breeding programme is now underway with the help of Toronto Zoo (3) and reintroductions are planned.

Animalia,Visayan warty pig ,Animalia,Chordata,Mammalia,Cetartiodactyla,Suidae,Sus (1),Females: 25 - 30 kg (5)Males: 35 - 40 kg (5)Male head-body length: 115 - 125 cm (5)Female head-body length: 90 - 100 cm (5),The Visayan warty pig is highly endangered; the species has been lost from 3 of the 6 major islands where it was found and is on the verge of disappearing from a fourth (4). Deforestation in the Philippines has been widespread and habitat loss along with hunting pressure is one of the main causes of the precipitous decline in numbers. Interbreeding with domestic pigs provides a further threat to the few surviving populations and it seems unlikely that purebred forms will persist in the wild for long (4). These pigs also suffer from persecution by local farmers who view the animals as pests; they are subject to high levels of illegal hunting pressure for local consumption are caught in pitfall traps or wire snares and may sometimes be killed with explosive devices that are baited and buried in the ground to be excavated by rooting individuals (6).,The Visayan Warty Pig Conservation Programme was established in 1991 (4) with the long-term aim of reintroducing 'warties' into areas from which they have been lost (3). Two captive breeding and rescue centres have been established on Negros one by Silliman University and another at the Negros Forests and Ecological Foundation (4). In addition a centre has been established on the island of Panay by the College of Agriculture and Forestry; as of June 2001 the total captive population for the species was 41 (4). The Visayan Warty Pig Conservation Programme is also involved with research into these poorly understood pigs and works to increase local awareness of the issues involved. The Philippines has more species of wild pig than any other nation however most of these are severely endangered and habitat loss and hunting are rife; the efforts to save the Visayan warty pig are a battle against time (3).

Animalia,Water frog ,Animalia,Chordata,Amphibia,Anura,Leptodactylidae,Telmatobius (1),Length: 5 cm (2),<em>Telmatobius espadai </em>is now an extremely rare species; a population census undertaken in 1998 found just one tadpole. This tadpole showed symptoms of chytridiomycosis a disease that causes death in frogs and is thought to contribute to declines and even extinctions in frog species around the world (1) (6). There are also significant concerns over the possible effects of a road situated very near to one of the locations where the frog has been located (1). In addition various species of water frog are sometimes consumed as part of drink with supposed aphrodisiac qualities and this may also have contributed to the decline of this species (7).,Despite <em>Telmatobius espadai </em>being classified as Critically Endangered by the IUCN Red List there are presently no known conservation methods in place for this species and no current information on its status. The Rio Apaza population is located on the edges of the Carrasco National Park and if it persists it will hopefully benefit from this proximity (1) (3).
Animalia,Wellington’s solitary coral ,Animalia,Cnidaria,Anthozoa,Scleractinia,Dendrophylliidae,Rhizopsammia (1),,Before 1982 Wellington\u2019s solitary coral was considered to be abundant at some sites.  Then the <strong>El Ni\xf1o</strong> event of 1982 and 1983 struck which destroyed most colonies of this species except for colonies at Cousins and Gordons Rocks.  Yet since 2000 Wellington\u2019s solitary coral has not been found even around these two small islets despite targeted searches.  The dramatic loss of this species since the <strong>El Ni\xf1o</strong> event suggests that this coral is particularly sensitive to changes to the temperature of the water in which they live and hints at their vulnerability to the effects of global climate change (1).,The unique biodiversity of the Gal\xe1pagos Islands and the surrounding waters is recognised and valued and thus the region is protected by being designated a Marine Reserve and World Heritage Site (1).  Wellington\u2019s solitary coral is also included in Appendix II of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) meaning that any international trade in this species should be carefully regulated (2).  Unfortunately neither of these measures protects this Critically Endangered coral from the threats of natural or man-induced climate change.

Animalia,White-bellied cinclodes ,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Furnariidae,Cinclodes (1),99 – 109 g (2),The habitat of the white-bellied cinclodes has been relatively undisturbed by humans due to its high altitude. However in the past five years the use of peat by humans has increased for use in activities such as mushroom-growing and gardening and this peat is extracted from the bogs which are inhabited by the white-bellied cinclodes. Due to the cinclodes\u2019 apparently very specific habitat requirements the activities of humans in towns and cities could reduce the survival chances of this species high-up in the mountains (2) (3).,The white-bellied cinclodes occurs within Jun\xedn National Reserve and has been the focus of a few recent studies attempting to estimate the species\u2019 population (2). This is an important step towards determining its status and therefore enabling appropriate conservation measures to be taken such as designating important reserves and monitoring the effects of peat extraction on the population (3).
