Alcatraz de Abbott; Piquero de Abbott,Papasula abbotti,Abbott's booby (Papasula abbotti),Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Pelecaniformes,Sulidae,Papasula (1),Length: 79 cm (2),Phosphate mining on Christmas Island in the 1960s and 70s caused the destruction of a third of Abbott's booby nesting habitat and has led to the subsequent deterioration of the remaining forest (4). Birds are strongly attached to nest sites and clearings are more exposed to wind turbulence which has a detrimental effect on breeding success and causes higher adult mortality (6). Recent development proposals for the island have again raised concern over the viability of remaining breeding habitat (5)., ,The majority of Abbott's booby nest sites occur within the Christmas Island National Park which was established in 1980 and covers 63 percent of the island (6). Nest site locations are monitored and the regeneration of previously cleared forest has occurred on much of the island (5). Although mining was resumed in 1990 it only involved the reworking of previously mined areas (6). The continued preservation and ban on clearing of the unique Christmas Island rainforest will be the key to the future viability of the Abbott's booby population (5). , ,,0,0
Abbotâs duiker,Cephalophus spadix,Abbottâs duiker (Cephalophus spadix),Animalia,Chordata,Mammalia,Cetartiodactyla,Bovidae,Cephalophus (1),50 â 60 kg (2),Like many other duikers Abbott\xe2\x80\x99s duiker is being impacted by a combination of hunting and habitat destruction (1) (2) (5).\xa0Hunted for its meat Abbott\xe2\x80\x99s duiker falls prey to snares laid in the forests it inhabits even within so-called protected areas (1) (7) while suitable habitat is gradually encroached upon by agriculture and logging (1) (2) (5).\xa0These human activities have resulted in the extinction of Abbott\xe2\x80\x99s duiker in areas where it once occurred and in 2008 the total population of Abbott\xe2\x80\x99s duiker was estimated at fewer than 1500 individuals (1)., ,Although Abbott\xe2\x80\x99s duiker occurs within several protected areas such as the Kilimanjaro National Park Udzungwa Mountains National Park and New Dabaga/Ulangambi Forest Reserve this does not completely protect this duiker from the threats of habitat loss and illegal hunting (1) (2) (5).\xa0In the Southern Highlands of Tanzania there are current efforts to employ hunters in environmental education initiatives in exchange for the cessation of hunting.\xa0The Abbott\xe2\x80\x99s duiker is also being used as a flagship species in village education programmes.\xa0This will hopefully be beneficial for many forest-dwelling animals including the Abbott\xe2\x80\x99s duiker (1).\xa0The expansion of certain protected areas to incorporate other important forests inhabited by Abbott\xe2\x80\x99s duiker (1) in addition to the enforcement of hunting bans within those areas (7) may be essential if this Endangered duiker is to survive. ,hunting; ,protected;,1,1

Adelaide pigmy blue-tongue skink; pygmy bluetongue,Tiliqua adelaidensis,Adelaide pygmy bluetongue skink (Tiliqua adelaidensis),Animalia,Chordata,Reptilia,Squamata,Scincidae,Tiliqua (1),Male snout-vent length: 3.8 - 10.6 cm (2)Female snout-vent length: 8.8 - 10.7 cm (2)Tail length: 2.2 - 7.9 cm (2),The Adelaide pygmy bluetongue skink was once feared to be the first of Australia\xe2\x80\x99s approximately 700 reptiles to become extinct since European colonization. Thankfully it was rediscovered in 1992 after 33 years of being presumed extinct (3). Currently only ten small populations of the Adelaide pygmy bluetongue skinkare known to exist (6). Arguably Australia\xe2\x80\x99s most enigmatic reptile its scarcity can be attributed to its unique ecology as well as population declines due to extensive habitat destruction (2)(3)., ,The South Australia Department of Environment and Conservation has produced a National Recovery Plan for the Adelaide pygmy bluetongue skink with the overall objective to achieve down-listing of the species from Endangered to Vulnerable within 10 years. The plan details actions such as ensuring remaining habitat is protected from any further degradation and undertaking field studies to establish the skink\xe2\x80\x99s habitat requirements (6). At present all populations of the Adelaide pygmy bluetongue skink occur on private land making the establishment of agreements with landowners an essential part of any plan and incentives may be offered to landowners to become involved in establishing sanctuaries for the Adelaide pygmy bluetongue skink on their land (6). , ,protected;,0,1

black-footed penguin; jackass penguin,Spheniscus demersus,African penguin (Spheniscus demersus),Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Sphenisciformes,Spheniscidae,Spheniscus (1),Length: 60 - 70 cm (2),The population of the African penguin has declined and it is estimated that its current size is a mere 10 percent of what it was at the turn of the 20th Century. Originally the fall in numbers was the result of the over-collection of eggs for food and disturbance caused by the collection of <strong>guano</strong> for fertiliser. Today however depleted fish stocks due to over-fishing and the risk of oil pollution are the most pertinent threats to the survival of the African penguin (5); a recent oil spill affected around 40 percent of the population.\xa0 Predation by Cape fur seals (<em>Arctocephalus pusillus</em>) and competition with them for food and breeding sites as well as shark predation has also had severe effects on African penguin numbers (2). The ongoing and rapid decline of the African penguin led to the species being uplisted from Vulnerable to Endangered on the IUCN Red List in 2010 (2)., ,The African penguin is protected by its listing on Appendix II of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) (3) and on Appendix II of the Convention on Migratory Species (CMS) (4). All of the breeding areas of the African penguin in South Africa are protected as National Parks or Nature Reserves and the collection of <strong>guano</strong> or eggs is no longer permitted. The recovery of rescued oiled African penguins has also been shown to be successful. Populations need further monitoring and the possibility of conserving fish stocks is under investigation amongst other measures if the future of Africa\xe2\x80\x99s only penguin is to be secured (2). ,fishing;pet;pollution; ,cites;protected;,3,2

Afrormosia; Assamela; Kokrodua,Pericopsis elata,African teak (Pericopsis elata),Plantae,Tracheophyta,Magnoliopsida,Fabales,Leguminosae,Pericopsis (1),Maximum height: 50 m (2)Diameter: up to 2m (2),The trade in the timber from this tree has soared since 1948 and the degree of exploitation has long been unsustainable across its range. The habitat has been lost and now regeneration is insufficient to replace lost populations (1). Illegal logging continues to decimate the remaining populations (2)., ,Urgent regulation of logging is necessary including the employment of Forestry Stewardship Council regulations on harvesting. In Ghana some enrichment planting is being practised where suitable areas with low numbers of African teak are planted with African teak seedlings but conservation of current populations is a priority (2). , ,,0,0

Cape hunting dog; painted hunting dog,Lycaon pictus,African wild dog (Lycaon pictus),Animalia,Chordata,Mammalia,Carnivora,Canidae,Lycaon (1),18 - 34 kg (2),African wild dogs require large home ranges to support viable populations and recent habitat fragmentation has caused a population decline (4). African wild dogs traditionally have a reputation for attacking livestock and despite this rarely occurring in practice they are therefore often persecuted wherever they come into contact with humans (2) (4). In addition road accidents and incidental snaring have recently become an important cause of mortality (2). These wild dogs are susceptible to disease; particularly those carried by domestic dogs such as canine distemper and rabies. A final threat that keeps African wild dog populations low is competition and predation with the other large carnivores of the African savanna such as lions and spotted hyaenas (6)., ,The current population of African wild dogs is estimated to be less than 5500 individuals (2). The majority of dogs are found in medium sized populations which are extremely vulnerable to sudden environmental change. Due to their expansive home ranges large areas of contiguous habitat are the key to the survival of this species and it is estimated that protected areas need to be greater than 10000 square kilometres in order to prevent detrimental contact with local human settlements (2) (4). Consequently even most of the larger reserves cannot fully contain African wild dog packs leading to clashes with humans (2). Preventing persecution through education is also a priority of the conservation action plan (2) (4) in an effort to preserve this most intriguing and unique <strong>canid</strong>. ,fragmentation;disease;pet; ,protected;,3,1
