Birds are strongly attached to nest sites and clearings are more exposed to wind turbulence which has a detrimental effect on breeding success and causes higher adult mortality (6). Recent development proposals for the island have again raised concern over the viability of remaining breeding habitat (5).,The majority of Abbott's booby nest sites occur within the Christmas Island National Park which was established in 1980 and covers 63 percent of the island (6). Nest site locations are monitored and the regeneration of previously cleared forest has occurred on much of the island (5). Although mining was resumed in 1990 it only involved the reworking of previously mined areas (6). The continued preservation and ban on clearing of the unique Christmas Island rainforest will be the key to the future viability of the Abbott's booby population (5).,,,,,,,,,Abbot‰Ûªs duiker,Abbott‰Ûªs duiker ,Animalia,Chordata,Mammalia,Cetartiodactyla,Bovidae,Cephalophus (1),50 ‰ÛÒ 60 kg (2),Like many other duikers Abbott\u2019s duiker is being impacted by a combination of hunting and habitat destruction (1) (2) (5).\xa0Hunted for its meat Abbott\u2019s duiker falls prey to snares laid in the forests it inhabits even within so-called protected areas (1) (7) while suitable habitat is gradually encroached upon by agriculture and logging (1) (2) (5).\xa0These human activities have resulted in the extinction of Abbott\u2019s duiker in areas where it once occurred and in 2008 the total population of Abbott\u2019s duiker was estimated at fewer than 1500 individuals (1).,Although Abbott\u2019s duiker occurs within several protected areas such as the Kilimanjaro National Park Udzungwa Mountains National Park and New Dabaga/Ulangambi Forest Reserve this does not completely protect this duiker from the threats of habitat loss and illegal hunting (1) (2) (5).\xa0In the Southern Highlands of Tanzania there are current efforts to employ hunters in environmental education initiatives in exchange for the cessation of hunting.\xa0The Abbott\u2019s duiker is also being used as a flagship species in village education programmes.\xa0This will hopefully be beneficial for many forest-dwelling animals including the Abbott\u2019s duiker (1).\xa0The expansion of certain protected areas to incorporate other important forests inhabited by Abbott\u2019s duiker (1) in addition to the enforcement of hunting bans within those areas (7) may be essential if this Endangered duiker is to survive.,,,,,,,,,,Cisticole des Aberdares,Aberdare cisticola ,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Cisticolidae,Cisticola (1),Cisticola (1),[],[],,,,,,,,,,Adelaide pigmy blue-tongue skink, pygmy bluetongue,Adelaide pygmy bluetongue skink ,Animalia,Chordata,Reptilia,Squamata,Scincidae,Tiliqua (1),Male snout-vent length: 3.8 - 10.6 cm (2)Female snout-vent length: 8.8 - 10.7 cm (2)Tail length: 2.2 - 7.9 cm (2),The Adelaide pygmy bluetongue skink was once feared to be the first of Australia\u2019s approximately 700 reptiles to become extinct since European colonization. Thankfully it was rediscovered in 1992 after 33 years of being presumed extinct (3). Currently only ten small populations of the Adelaide pygmy bluetongue skinkare known to exist (6). Arguably Australia\u2019s most enigmatic reptile its scarcity can be attributed to its unique ecology as well as population declines due to extensive habitat destruction (2)(3).,The South Australia Department of Environment and Conservation has produced a National Recovery Plan for the Adelaide pygmy bluetongue skink with the overall objective to achieve down-listing of the species from Endangered to Vulnerable within 10 years. The plan details actions such as ensuring remaining habitat is protected from any further degradation and undertaking field studies to establish the skink\u2019s habitat requirements (6). At present all populations of the Adelaide pygmy bluetongue skink occur on private land making the establishment of agreements with landowners an essential part of any plan and incentives may be offered to landowners to become involved in establishing sanctuaries for the Adelaide pygmy bluetongue skink on their land (6).,,,,,,,,,Adriatic trout, softmouth trout,Adriatic salmon ,Animalia,Chordata,Actinopterygii,Salmoniformes,Salmonidae,Salmo (1),80 - 425 g (4),The Adriatic salmon faces a number of threats including overfishing for sport and for food as well as habitat destruction and competition with introduced species (1).,There are currently no known conservation measures in place for the Adriatic salmon (1) (5). It has been recommended that a number of key rivers in which this species occurs should be given full protection and guarded from any habitat alteration (5).,,,,,,,,,Bejeque gomero,Aeonium ,Plantae,Tracheophyta,Magnoliopsida,Rosales,Crassulaceae,Aeonium (1),Aeonium (1),[],[],,,,,,,,,,black-footed penguin, jackass penguin,African penguin ,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Sphenisciformes,Spheniscidae,Spheniscus (1),Length: 60 - 70 cm (2),The population of the African penguin has declined and it is estimated that its current size is a mere 10 percent of what it was at the turn of the 20th Century. Originally the fall in numbers was the result of the over-collection of eggs for food and disturbance caused by the collection of <strong>guano</strong> for fertiliser. Today however depleted fish stocks due to over-fishing and the risk of oil pollution are the most pertinent threats to the survival of the African penguin (5); a recent oil spill affected around 40 percent of the population.\xa0 Predation by Cape fur seals (<em>Arctocephalus pusillus</em>) and competition with them for food and breeding sites as well as shark predation has also had severe effects on African penguin numbers (2). The ongoing and rapid decline of the African penguin led to the species being uplisted from Vulnerable to Endangered on the IUCN Red List in 2010 (2).,The African penguin is protected by its listing on Appendix II of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) (3) and on Appendix II of the Convention on Migratory Species (CMS) (4). All of the breeding areas of the African penguin in South Africa are protected as National Parks or Nature Reserves and the collection of <strong>guano</strong> or eggs is no longer permitted. The recovery of rescued oiled African penguins has also been shown to be successful. Populations need further monitoring and the possibility of conserving fish stocks is under investigation amongst other measures if the future of Africa\u2019s only penguin is to be secured (2).,,,,,,,,,Afrormosia, Assamela, Kokrodua,African teak ,Plantae,Tracheophyta,Magnoliopsida,Fabales,Leguminosae,Pericopsis (1),Maximum height: 50 m (2)Diameter: up to 2m (2),The trade in the timber from this tree has soared since 1948 and the degree of exploitation has long been unsustainable across its range. The habitat has been lost and now regeneration is insufficient to replace lost populations (1). Illegal logging continues to decimate the remaining populations (2).,Urgent regulation of logging is necessary including the employment of Forestry Stewardship Council regulations on harvesting. In Ghana some enrichment planting is being practised where suitable areas with low numbers of African teak are planted with African teak seedlings but conservation of current populations is a priority (2).,,,,,,,,Cape hunting dog, painted hunting dog,African wild dog ,Animalia,Chordata,Mammalia,Carnivora,Canidae,Lycaon (1),18 - 34 kg (2),African wild dogs require large home ranges to support viable populations and recent habitat fragmentation has caused a population decline (4). African wild dogs traditionally have a reputation for attacking livestock and despite this rarely occurring in practice they are therefore often persecuted wherever they come into contact with humans (2) (4). In addition road accidents and incidental snaring have recently become an important cause of mortality (2). These wild dogs are susceptible to disease; particularly those carried by domestic dogs such as canine distemper and rabies. A final threat that keeps African wild dog populations low is competition and predation with the other large carnivores of the African savanna such as lions and spotted hyaenas (6).,The current population of African wild dogs is estimated to be less than 5500 individuals (2). The majority of dogs are found in medium sized populations which are extremely vulnerable to sudden environmental change. Due to their expansive home ranges large areas of contiguous habitat are the key to the survival of this species and it is estimated that protected areas need to be greater than 10000 square kilometres in order to prevent detrimental contact with local human settlements (2) (4). Consequently even most of the larger reserves cannot fully contain African wild dog packs leading to clashes with humans (2). Preventing persecution through education is also a priority of the conservation action plan (2) (4) in an effort to preserve this most intriguing and unique <strong>canid</strong>.,,,,,,,,,Kaori de montagne, Kaori nain,Agathis ,Plantae,Tracheophyta,Coniferopsida,Coniferales,Araucariaceae,Agathis (1),Agathis (1),[],[],,,,,,,,,Dark-handed gibbon,Agile gibbon ,Animalia,Chordata,Mammalia,Primates,Hylobatidae,Hylobates (1),Hylobates (1),[],[],,,,,,,,,,Hemignathus wilsoni,Akiapola'au ,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Drepanididae,Hemignathus (1),Length: 14 cm (2),As with many species on Hawaii the \xe2\x80\x98Akiapola\xe2\x80\x99au is threatened by deforestation and habitat degradation due to livestock grazing and is also preyed upon by introduced rats and feral cats. The introduction of mosquitoes to Hawaii has resulted in the spread of avian diseases which confine many bird species including the \xe2\x80\x98Akiapola\xe2\x80\x99au to higher elevations. This species has a low reproductive rate and is slow to recover from population reductions (2).,Relatively large \xe2\x80\x98Akiapola\xe2\x80\x99au populations are found within the boundaries of Ka\xe2\x80\x99u Forest Reserve and Hakalau Forest National Wildlife Refuge. Outside these areas some habitat is being restored (2) and young koa forests on the volcano of Mauna Loa now support high densities of Akiapolaau (6). It is hoped that the \xe2\x80\x98Akiapola\xe2\x80\x99au might be <strong>re-introduced</strong> into other newly restored habitat. Plans to restore corridors of habitat between areas of forest occupied by the \xe2\x80\x98Akiapola\xe2\x80\x99au may reduce the damaging effects of habitat fragmentation including <strong>inbreeding depression</strong> (2).,,,,,,,,,,Long-tailed tyrannulet,Alagoas tyrannulet ,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Tyrannidae,Phylloscartes (1),Phylloscartes (1),[],[],,,,,,,,,,Albanian frog, Albanian pool frog, Balkan frog, Virpazar frog,Albanian water frog ,Animalia,Chordata,Amphibia,Anura,Ranidae,Pelophylax (1),Male length: c. 71 mm (2)Female length: c. 74 mm (2),The main threats to the Albanian water frog are the drainage of wetlands and agrochemical and industrial pollution of aquatic habitats. Over-collection of this species for commercial purposes is a significant threat in the northern parts of its range such as along the shores of Lake Skadar (1) (3) (4).,The Albanian water frog is listed on Appendix III of the Bern Convention which means that it should be afforded protection (12).,,,,,,,Himalayan musk deer,Alpine musk deer ,Animalia,Chordata,Mammalia,Cetartiodactyla,Moschidae,Moschus (1),Moschus (1),[],[],,,,,,,,,,Souimanga d'Usambara,Amani sunbird ,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Nectariniidae,Anthreptes (1),Anthreptes (1),[],[],,,,,,,,,,Umburana Do Cheiro,Amburana ,Plantae,Tracheophyta,Magnoliopsida,Fabales,Leguminosae,Amburana (1),Amburana (1),[],[],,,,,,,,,,Oro de risco,Anagyris ,Plantae,Tracheophyta,Magnoliopsida,Fabales,Leguminosae,Anagyris (1),Anagyris (1),[],[],,,,,,,,,,Anaxagorea costaricensis,Anaxagorea ,Plantae,Tracheophyta,Magnoliopsida,Magnoliales,Annonaceae,Anaxagorea (1),Anaxagorea (1),[],[],,,,,,,,,,Rhinolophus famulus,Andaman horseshoe bat ,Animalia,Chordata,Mammalia,Chiroptera,Rhinolophidae,Rhinoplophus (1),Rhinoplophus (1),[],[],,,,,,,,,,Andean mountain cat, mountain cat.,Andean cat ,Animalia,Chordata,Mammalia,Carnivora,Felidae,Oreailurus (1),4 kg (2),It is not clear whether the rarity of the Andean cat is a natural phenomenon or attributable to human actions. Alternatively it may simply be a misperception resulting from lack of observations (2). Pelts of this species have been seen in local markets occasionally killed by herders who carry guns (2). The high Andean Indians appear to have little knowledge of this species and the only pelts observed to be used in local ceremonies have been those of the pampas cat (5). There are no records of international trade of this species either. It is therefore thought that hunting of the Andean cat is primarily carried out to protect local cattle (1). The common threat of habitat destruction common worldwide does not apply here as there have been no significant changes in land-use of the high Andes over the last 2000 years. If anything the human population has decreased in these regions (2).,International trade of this species is prohibited by its listing on Appendix I of CITES (3) and according to national legislation the Andean cat is fully protected throughout its range (2). There is a huge gap in our knowledge of this species and how to best protect it. However since the publication of the Cat Action Treasury Plan there have been substantial increases in research efforts (1) (7). The Cat Action Treasury has sponsored surveys to determine the status of this species and improve our understanding of this cat in order to inform conservation measures (8). These surveys confirmed the rarity of this species. The Andean cat has been upgraded from Vulnerable to Endangered on the IUCN Red List (1) (7). It has been suggested by the Andean Cat Alliance (AGA) previously the Committee for the Conservation of the Andean Cat (COCGA) that because this cat needs large areas to live successfully and its range extends over the Andes through international borders a multinational cooperative approach is necessary for its long-term conservation (5). AGA has launched a multinational project to collate and analyse data on the on the Andean cat in order to initiate immediate conservation efforts and in 2004 a conservation action plan was drawn up for the species. The fact that there are no captive specimens or breeding programmes for the Andean cat means that the survival of this species depends on the development and success of these conservation measures (5).,,,,,,,,,Anderson‰Ûªs newt, Ryukyu spiny newt,Anderson‰Ûªs crocodile newt ,Animalia,Chordata,Amphibia,Caudata,Salamandridae,Echinotriton (1),Echinotriton (1),[],[],,,,,,,,,Lake Junin frog,Andes smooth frog ,Animalia,Chordata,Amphibia,Anura,Leptodactylidae,Telmatobius (1),Telmatobius (1),[],[],,,,,,,,,,Mantidactylus brygoomantis madecassus, Rhacophorus philautus madecassus,Andringitra Madagascar frog ,Animalia,Chordata,Amphibia,Anura,Mantellidae,Mantidactylus (1),Mantidactylus (1),[],[],,,,,,,,,Mantidactylus microtympanum,Angel‰Ûªs Madagascar frog ,Animalia,Chordata,Amphibia,Anura,Mantellidae,Boehmantis (1),Male length: 5.3 cm (2)Female length: 7.6 cm (2),Owing to its restricted range Angel\u2019s Madagascar frog is highly vulnerable to the ongoing large-scale degradation and destruction of forest that is occurring in south-east Madagascar. Although this species remains relatively abundant at some localities a multitude of threats including expanding human settlements agriculture logging livestock grazing charcoal manufacture and the spread of invasive eucalyptus are causing its population to decline. The pressures have already proven severe enough to cause local extinctions around Fort Dauphin near the southern limit of the Angel\u2019s Madagascar frog\u2019s range (1).,While there are no known conservation measures specifically targeting Angel\u2019s Madagascar frog it is found in two protected areas the Andohahela and Midongy-du-Sud National Parks (1). Nevertheless increased protection of this species\u2019 habitat along with educational programs to inform local people of how best to manage the forests sustainably are vital measures that must be implemented if Angel\u2019s Madagascar frog is to be conserved (6).,,,,,,,,,,Blind swamp eel,Anguila ciega ,Animalia,Chordata,Actinopterygii,Synbranchiformes,Synbranchidae,Ophisternon (1),Length: up to at least 32.5 cm (2),The main threats to this species are various forms of water pollution caused by humans. In rural areas sewage is rarely treated before being discarded and industrial and domestic waste is sometimes disposed of in caves. Another threat comes from over-harvesting of freshwater which may lead to <strong>saline waters</strong> creeping into the normally freshwater zone. The human population of the Yucatan peninsula is growing so a greater and greater strain on water resources can be expected in the future. Another potential threat is the modification and/or the intensive use of this fish\u2019s habitat by humans for recreational or tourism purposes (2).,There are currently no conservation measures targeting the Anguila ciega.,,,,,,,,,,Car-cara,Aniba ,Plantae,Tracheophyta,Magnoliopsida,Laurales,Lauraceae,Aniba (1),Aniba (1),[],[],,,,,,,,,,Lepilemur septentrionalis,Ankarana sportive lemur ,Animalia,Chordata,Mammalia,Primates,Lepilemuridae,Lepilemur (1),Lepilemur (1),[],[],,,,,,,,,,Annickia kummeriae, Enantia kummerae, Enantia kummeriae,Annickia ,Plantae,Tracheophyta,Magnoliopsida,Magnoliales,Annonaceae,Annickia (1),Annickia (1),[],[],,,,,,,,Norops amplisquamosus,Anolis ,Animalia,Chordata,Reptilia,Squamata,Polychrotidae,Anolis (1),Anolis (1),[],[],,,,,,,,,,Norops cusuco,Anolis ,Animalia,Chordata,Reptilia,Squamata,Polychrotidae,Anolis (1),Anolis (1),[],[],,,,,,,,,,Antirrhinum molle subspecies lopesianum,Antirrhinum ,Plantae,Tracheophyta,Magnoliopsida,Scrophulariales,Scrophulariaceae,Antirrhinum (1),Antirrhinum (1),[],[],,,,,,,,,,armoured chameleon, stump tailed chameleon,Antsingy leaf chameleon ,Animalia,Chordata,Reptilia,Squamata,Chamaeleonidae,Brookesia (1),Length: up to 11cm (2),Chameleons are favoured as pets across the world due to their fascinating appearance and behaviour. Collection and trade has therefore taken its toll on many chameleon species but international trade in this species is now prohibited (9). However habitat degradation remains a threat even though the species is found within a national park. As this species depends on the presence of leaf litter for food shelter and laying its eggs and also on low shrubs and seedlings for roosting at night its survival is dependent on maintaining the existing vegetation structure within the Tsingy forests (5) (10).,The Antsingy leaf chameleon is listed on Appendix I of the Convention on International Trade of Endangered Species (CITES) and as such international trade of this species is illegal (3). Its survival is not immediately threatened in the wild although it is still justifiably a conservation priority because of its limited range and the continued degradation of its favoured habitats within the national park (1) (2) (10).,,,,,,,,,Apolinar‰Ûªs marsh-wren,Apolinar‰Ûªs wren ,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Troglodytidae,Cistothorus (1),Length: 12 cm (2),Apolinar\u2019s wren has a small population and this combined with its limited geographical range results in an inherent threat of extinction. Numbers of Apolinar\u2019s wren have indeed declined significantly in the last 50 to 70 years primarily due to a 95 percent loss in habitat (3). A significant cause of this habitat destruction is the burning of wetlands for agriculture mainly onion cultivation and cattle-farming. With agriculture also frequently comes the use of insecticides and other chemicals resulting in a reduction in this bird\u2019s insect prey and posing a toxic threat to the bird. In areas around the capital Bogot\xe1 remaining wetland habitats are at risk from human settlement and highway development and reed-harvesting and tourism also pose minor threats (1).,Apolinar\u2019s wren occurs in El Cocuy National Park Boyac\xe1 and in Sumap\xe1z National Park Cundinamarca which may offer protection against the threat of habitat loss (2).,,,,,,,,,,Hemitragus jayakari,Arabian tahr ,Animalia,Chordata,Mammalia,Cetartiodactyla,Bovidae,Arabitragus (1),c. 23 kg (2),The Arabian tahr is currently extremely endangered as a result of intense grazing competition from livestock illegal hunting and habitat degradation through human development (5). Unfortunately the species\u2019 dependence upon visiting waterholes leaves it vulnerable to ambush by poachers (3). Human migrations to urban areas have increased in Oman in recent years resulting in domestic goats being left to become feral which now forage in areas that were once the realm of the tahr. Additionally several roads and buildings have been constructed near and within the tahr\u2019s range which are new potential sources of disturbance pollution and habitat fragmentation. In particular plans for mineral extraction in southern parts of the range could result in significant habitat loss (6). Tahr populations in UAE appear to be especially localised and possibly isolated. The concern is that isolation of sub-populations will lead to the diminished genetic variation associated with inbreeding which in turn results in increased susceptibility to disease and decreased fertility spelling disaster for the Arabian tahr in UAE (3).,In 1973 efforts were initiated to protect the Arabian tahr and in 1975 active protection was granted over a wide range of the eastern Hajar Mountains of Oman with local men recruited as rangers under the Office of the Advisor for Conservation of the Environment (6). Unfortunately this area still awaits to be awarded official status by a Royal Decree with an approved funded and implemented management plan (6) (7). However in 2009 Wadi Wurayah Fujairah home to the Arbaian tahr and other rare and endangered species was officially declared as the United Arab Emirates\u2019 first protected mountain area (8).,,,,,,,,,,Lagartija Aranesa,Aran rock lizard ,Animalia,Chordata,Reptilia,Squamata,Lacertidae,Iberolacerta (1),Snout-vent length: up to 6 cm (2),The rocky alpine habitat of the Aran rock lizard is currently threatened by overgrazing by cattle and may face further pressure in the future from the development of ski resorts and the associated building of roads and tracks (1). The IUCN who assessed the conservation status of this lizard also state the possible development of hydroelectric projects and mining as a future threat to this species (1). The low reproductive potential of the Aran rock lizard and its restricted distribution only act to enhance the devastating effects that such threats may have on the population (3).,The Aran rock lizard is listed on Appendix III of the Bern Convention a convention which aims to conserve wild flora and fauna and their natural habitats and to promote European co-operation in that field (4). Wild animal species on Appendix III are protected but can be exploited if regulated in accordance with the convention (4). It is yet to be seen whether this level of protection is sufficient to ensure the survival of this Endangered reptile.,,,,,,,,,,Magarza de Lid, Magarza de Risco,Argyranthemum ,Plantae,Tracheophyta,Magnoliopsida,Asterales,Compositae,Argyranthemum (1),Argyranthemum (1),[],[],,,,,,,,,Ditaxis argentea,Argythamnia ,Plantae,Tracheophyta,Magnoliopsida,Euphotbiales,Euphorbiaceae,Argythamnia (1),Argythamnia (1),[],[],,,,,,,,,,Campylaea phalerata,Arianta ,Animalia,Mollusca,Gastropoda,Stylommatophora,Helicidae,Arianta (1),Arianta (1),[],[],,,,,,,,,,Arrojadoa dinae ssp. eriocaulis,Arrojadoa ,Plantae,Tracheophyta,Magnoliopsida,Caryophyllales,Cactaceae,Arrojadoa (1),Arrojadoa (1),[],[],,,,,,,,,,Obregnita,Artichoke cactus ,Plantae,Tracheophyta,Magnoliopsida,Caryophyllales,Cactaceae,Obregonia (1),Head diameter: 2.5 - 20 cm (2),Artichoke cacti are in high demand for commercial trade and have previously been collected in large numbers (2). Local people use this species to treat rheumatism and over-collection for this reason is also a threat (1). Habitat destruction through urban development road construction and livestock grazing pose further threats to survival; accelerated erosion has been observed at both known sites of this species (2). The total population is thought to have decreased by as much as 50% over the past 50 years; although around 5000 individuals still remain (1).,International trade in wild-taken plants and seeds of the artichoke cactus is banned by its listing on Appendix I of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) (3). The species is also protected under Mexican law (4) although illegal collection does still occur (1). It has been suggested that the Valley of Jaumave is a prime candidate for a nature reserve (2) which if created would preserve the future of this appealing cactus amongst various others.,,,,,,,,,,Philautus asankai,Asanka's shrub frog ,Animalia,Chordata,Amphibia,Anura,Rhacophoridae,Pseudophilautus (1),Pseudophilautus (1),[],[],,,,,,,,,,Asian bonytongue, golden arowana, golden dragon fish, kelesa,Asian arowana ,Animalia,Chordata,Actinopterygii,Osteoglossiformes,Osteoglossidae,Scleropages (1),Scleropages (1),[],[],,,,,,,Asiatic buffalo, feral water buffalo, Indian buffalo, water buffalo, wild Asiatic buffalo, wild water buffalo,Asian buffalo ,Animalia,Chordata,Mammalia,Cetartiodactyla,Bovidae,Bubalus (1),up to 1.2 tonnes (male) (2),Although domestic buffalo are widespread and thriving there is a very real possibility that true wild Asian buffalo will become extinct in the near future if they have not already done so (3). Indeed the total world population is thought to almost certainly be less than 4000 individuals perhaps considerably less but there is also a very real possibility that no pure-bred wild Asian buffalo exist anymore. Unfortunately accurate assessment of numbers is problematic due to the difficulty of distinguishing pure animals from free-ranging domestic or feral buffalo (1). Nevertheless the species is generally accepted to be undergoing very serious declines as a result of hunting habitat loss and degradation as agricultural land use expands and <strong>hybridisation</strong> with domestic and/or feral buffalo (1) (3). Other threats include diseases and parasites transmitted by domestic livestock and competition for food and water between wild and domestic buffalo (1).,Wild Asian buffalo are listed under Appendix III of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) in Nepal which limits the quantity of animal products that can be exported and imported across international borders but this does not regulate domestic trade (4). Nevertheless the species is legally protected across its range in Bhutan Nepal India and Thailand and it is thought that pure-bred populations may occur in several protected areas (1). Existing conservation programmes are focusing on preserving the buffalo\u2019s diminishing habitat but this is becoming increasingly difficult as human populations expand and encroachment continues (3). Sadly the future does not look bright for pure-bred Asian buffalo which are currently in very grave danger of disappearing forever if they have not already done so.,,,,,Japanese crested Ibis, Toki,Asian crested ibis ,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Ciconiiformes,Threskiornithidae,Nipponia (1),Length: 55 - 78.5 cm (2),Although abundant throughout Eastern Asia up until a century ago deforestation and habitat destruction caused the Asian crested ibis population to crash during the 20th century. When the last wild birds in Japan were taken into captivity in 1981 the species was believed to be extinct in the wild but later that year a tiny population of seven birds was discovered in a remote mountainous area of Shaanxi Province in China (4) (5) (9). Thanks to the implementation of a conservation programme and the enforcement of laws protecting habitat the wild population had risen to more than 600 wild individuals by 2009 (4) (5). However although its population continues to increase there are still fears for the Asian crested ibis with various factors still threatening to undermine this species\u2019 recovery. Indeed the ongoing conversion of rice fields to dry wheat production is rapidly reducing the availability of feeding areas. Additional threats include the use of agrochemicals at feeding sites occasional hunting and low genetic diversity (4) (9).,In addition to its legal protection in China numerous conservation measures have been introduced since the Asian crested ibis\u2019 rediscovery including the protection of nesting sites and the periodic prohibition of logging hunting with firearms and usage of agrochemicals (4) (9). As of 2009 there are around 500 birds occurring within several captive breeding programmes (5). Following the successes of these programmes captive bred birds are now being used to reintroduce the Asian crested ibis to parts of its original range in China and Japan (4) (5) (10).,,,,,,,,,Indian elephant,Asian elephant ,Animalia,Chordata,Mammalia,Proboscidea,Elephantidae,Elephas (1),Head-body length: 5.5 - 6.4 m (2)Shoulder height: 2.5 - 3 m (2)Male weight: 5.4 tonnes (2)Female weight: 2.7 tonnes (2),Numbers of Asian elephants were decimated by habitat loss and hunting throughout their historical range. Vast tracts of land have been logged or simply cleared to accommodate the growing human population in the region (2). Such disturbance from infrastructure development can also cause increased stress and confusion amongst elephants (8). Elephant populations have become increasingly isolated in the fragmented habitat that remains often coming into conflict with local farmers (7). Crops are damaged and lives lost; up to 300 people a year are killed by elephants in India (4) leading to retaliation on local elephants (9). Poaching for ivory is also a threat and because only males have tusks populations can become extremely skewed towards females thus affecting breeding rates (2).,The Asian elephant is protected from international trade by its listing on Appendix I of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) although illegal poaching remains a problem (4). Many elephants occur within protected reserves but these are often too small to accommodate them leading to human-elephant conflict (4). Many elephant populations are also found along international borders where management may be weak and a lack of trans-boundary cooperation also hinders elephant protection and management (8). The creation of wildlife corridors to extend reserve lands together with the cessation of poaching are just some of the conservation steps needed to secure the future of the Asian elephant (9). The World Wildlife Fund (WWF) launched the Asian Rhino and Elephant Action Strategy (AREAS) in 1998 to address these issues and this multifaceted conservation programme is also working with local people to reduce conflict with these magnificent animals (8).,,,,,,,,,,Indian tapir, Malay tapir, Malayan tapir,Asian tapir ,Animalia,Chordata,Mammalia,Perissodactyla,Tapiridae,Tapirus (1),250 ‰ÛÒ 540 kg (2),Widely abundant in Southern Myanmar Thailand Malaysia and Indonesia in the early 1930s Asian tapir populations have since rapidly declined and now survive only as isolated populations in remote or protected areas. Habitat destruction poses the predominant threat as a result of land being cleared for human settlement and agriculture and rivers being dammed and land flooded for hydroelectric development (11). In Sumatra uncontrolled illegal logging still occurs. The tapir population is strongest in Malaysia where deforestation has greatly declined (1).,Protective game laws exist in Thailand Myanmar Malaysia and Indonesia with varying success (11). In Malaysia the Asian tapir has been given total protection since 1955 under the Wild Animals and Birds Ordinance and law enforcement has generally been effective. The use of steel wire snares has been banned here with stiff penalties if caught. However ongoing monitoring of the illegal tapir trade across the range of this species is crucial (2). Asian tapirs can be found in a number of protected areas including the Huai Kha Khaeng Wildlife Sanctuary and the Khao Sok National Park in Thailand 12 protected areas in the Western Forest Complex along the Thai-Myanmar border (1) and the Way Kambas National Park in Sumatra which contains around 200 individuals (11). However much of the suitable habitat that remains in Sumatra does not lie within protected areas and a large proportion of the tapir population occurs outside of reserves. Conservation efforts should not therefore be restricted to national parks but should endeavour to involve the cooperation of local people across the species\u2019 range (11).,,,,,,,,Asian brown tortoise, Asian giant tortoise, black giant tortoise, Burmese brown tortoise, Burmese mountain tortoise, six-legged tortoise,Asian tortoise ,Animalia,Chordata,Reptilia,Testudines,Testudinidae,Manouria (1),M. e. emys carapace length: up to 50 cm (2)M. e. emys weight: up to 20 kg (2)M. e. phayrei carapace length: up to 60 cm (2)M. e. phayrei weight: up to 37 kg (2),Like other Asian turtles and tortoises this species is severely threatened by over-harvesting and exploitation for the food and pet trade compounded by habitat destruction. Most records indicate that Asian tortoise populations are sparse and extremely fragmented (6). Sadly being such a large species the Asian tortoise is a relatively easy target for hunters and collectors (4) and its fairly high market value makes it a much sought after species (2).,International trade is controlled by the Asian tortoise\u2019s listing on CITES Appendix II (6). However despite the species being uplisted from \u2018Vulnerable\u2019 to \u2018Endangered\u2019 on the IUCN Red List in 2000 the legal export quota from Peninsula Malaysia was raised from 50 wild caught specimens in 1999 to 200 in 2000 and to 500 in 2002 (3) (6). In 2006 this quota was reduced to 400 (3) but this still seems too high for a species facing possible extinction. Although imports are now totally banned in the European Community this has only served to shift the trade towards Japan and the U.S. (6). The Asian brown tortoise (<i>M. e. emys</i>) is legally protected in Sabah Malaysia under the Wildlife Conservation Enactment 1997 and a license is required from the director of the Wildlife Department to hunt or collect wild specimens (6).,,,,,yellow pond turtle,Asian yellow pond turtle ,Animalia,Chordata,Reptilia,Testudines,Geoemydidae,Mauremys (1),Carapace length: up to 20 cm (2),The majority of Asia\u2019s freshwater turtles are threatened with extinction (7) (8) and the Asian yellow pond turtle is no exception (1). This \u2018Asian Turtle Crisis\u2019 is mainly attributable to largely uncontrolled trade for food traditional medicine and pets (7) (9) (10) driven primarily by increased demand in China (7) (11).,The Asian turtle trade was largely unregulated prior to 2002. However since then several species of Asian turtle have been listed under the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) (9). The Asian yellow pond turtle is listed on CITES Appendix II which requires export permits for international trade (3). Unfortunately enforcement appears limited and globally threatened species of turtle remain in trade in China (9).,,,,,,,,,,Asian wild ass, khulan, khur, kulan, onager,Asiatic wild ass ,Animalia,Chordata,Mammalia,Perissodactyla,Equidae,Equus (1),200 - 260 kg (2),The greatest threat facing the Asiatic wild ass is poaching for meat and hides and in some areas for use in traditional medicine (5) (7). The extreme isolation of many of the subpopulations is in itself a threat as genetic problems can result from inbreeding (7). Overgrazing by livestock reduces food availability and herders also reduce the availability of water at springs. The cutting down of nutritious shrubs and bushes exacerbates the problem. Furthermore a series of drought years could have devastating effects on this beleaguered species (6). Habitat fragmentation is a particular concern in Mongolia as result of the increasingly dense network of roads railway lines and fences required to support mining activities (1) (5).,The Asiatic wild ass does occur in a number of protected sites where targeted conservation action has been taken. Domestic animals have been removed from some protected areas and artificial watering holes have been made. Hay is provided for the species and there are hefty fines for poaching. Moreover the species is legally protected in many of the countries in which it occurs (6). The priority for future conservation measures is: to ensure the protection of this species in particularly vulnerable parts of its range; to encourage the involvement of local people in the conservation of the Asiatic wild ass; and to conduct further research into the behaviour ecology and taxonomy of the species (1). Fortunately several Asiatic wild ass research programmes considering these issues are already underway (5) (6).,,,,,,Esparragera,Asparagus ,Plantae,Tracheophyta,Liliopsida,Liliales,Asparagaceae,Asparagus (1),Asparagus (1),[],[],,,,,,,,,,Peroba AÌ_Ì_,Aspidosperma ,Plantae,Tracheophyta,Magnoliopsida,Gentianales,Apocynaceae,Aspidosperma (1),Aspidosperma (1),[],[],,,,,,,,,,Kachuga sylhetensis,Assam roofed turtle ,Animalia,Chordata,Reptilia,Testudines,Geoemydidae,Pangshura (1),Pangshura (1),[],[],,,,,,,,,,Aster des PyrÌ©nÌ©es,Aster ,Plantae,Tracheophyta,Magnoliopsida,Asterales,Compositae,Aster (1),Aster (1),[],[],,,,,,,,,,Northern bluefin tuna,Atlantic bluefin tuna ,Animalia,Chordata,Actinopterygii,Perciformes,Scombridae,Thunnus (1),Maximum length: 4.6 m (2)Maximum weight: 684 kg (2),With its large size and high quality flesh the Atlantic bluefin tuna has long been a favourite of fishermen and a highly valued delicacy in Japan (3). Its popularity has led to severe exploitation in several areas particularly the North Atlantic Ocean (2). Despite catch quotas being in place limits are often not respected and catches are frequently under-reported (5). Unless adequate management measures are quickly implemented and most importantly enforced the collapse of some Atlantic bluefin tuna stocks is a real possibility (5). It is thought that the Critically Endangered western Atlantic stock may have already collapsed the result of overfishing and poor management. This stock is now in grave danger of extinction (6).,In 1966 the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (ICCAT) was formed taking responsibility for the conservation of tunas in the Atlantic Ocean and its adjacent seas (5). Since 1998 catch limits have been in place for the Atlantic bluefin tuna in the eastern Atlantic and Mediterranean but until 2006 it was believed that these limits were not respected and were largely ineffective (5). In 2006 ICCAT adopted a 15 year recovery plan for the highly threatened stocks of the eastern Atlantic and Mediterranean. The plan includes stricter catch limits and more extensive closures of fisheries in certain areas and at certain times (5).,,,,,,,,,,hooded petrel, Schlegel's petrel,Atlantic petrel ,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Procellariiformes,Procellariidae,Pterodroma (1),c. 520 g (3),Although still common the Atlantic petrel qualifies as Endangered because it has a very small breeding range with the vast majority of the population on just one island (2). Such a limited range places the bird at risk from chance events such as natural disasters or the introduction of mammalian predators (2) (6). On Gough predation by the introduced house mouse (<i>Mus musculus</i>) is having a severe effect on the Atlantic petrel\u2019s breeding success with just two percent of the chicks reaching fledging in 2007 (2). The large population of native southern skua (<i>Catharacta antarctica</i>) are also known to feed on seabirds including the Atlantic petrel (2).,Gough Island is both a Nature Reserve and World Heritage Site and while this provides good protection from human disturbance it does not offer the Gough bunting any protection from the mouse predation that is driving it towards extinction (2). A study of the mice conducted by The Royal Society for the Protection of Birds (RSPB) and funded by the UK government's Overseas Territories Environment Programme has shown that their eradication from the island is feasible. Unfortunately however until adequate funding is acquired this will not occur (7). Gough Island is widely recognised as having one of the most diverse bird colonies in the world including four endangered species and every effort should therefore be made to protect it and the rich biodiversity it hosts (8).,,,,,,,,,Cabezuela Marina, Cancelillo, Cardo Enrejado, PiÌ±amar Mayor,Atractylis ,Plantae,Tracheophyta,Magnoliopsida,Asterales,Compositae,Atractylis (1),Atractylis (1),[],[],,,,,,,PiÌ±a de Mar, PiÌ±amar,Atractylis ,Plantae,Tracheophyta,Magnoliopsida,Asterales,Compositae,Atractylis (1),Atractylis (1),[],[],,,,,,,,,Lagartija Pallaresa,Aurelio‰Ûªs rock lizard ,Animalia,Chordata,Reptilia,Squamata,Lacertidae,Iberolacerta (1),Snout-vent length: up to 6 cm (2),The rocky alpine habitat of Aurelio\u2019s rock lizard is currently threatened by overgrazing by cattle and may face further pressure in the future from the development of ski resorts and the associated building of roads and tracks (1).  The IUCN who assessed the conservation status of this lizard also state the possible development of hydroelectric projects and mining as a future threat to this species (1).  The low reproductive potential of Aurelio\u2019s rock lizard and its restricted distribution only act to enhance the devastating effects that such threats may have on the population (3).,Aurelio\u2019s rock lizard is listed on Appendix III of the Bern Convention a convention which aims to conserve wild flora and fauna and their natural habitats and to promote European co-operation in that field (4).  Wild animal species on Appendix III are protected but can be exploited if regulated in accordance with the convention (4).  It is yet to be seen whether this level of protection is sufficient to ensure the survival of this Endangered reptile.,,,,,,,,,,Australian bittern, black-backed bittern, boomer, brown bittern, bull-bird, bullhead, bunyip bird,Australasian bittern ,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Ciconiiformes,Ardeidae,Botaurus (1),Length: 66 - 76 cm (2) (3)Wingspan: 105 - 118 cm (2)Male weight: 875 - 2,085 g (3)Female weight: 571 - 1,135 g (3),The Australasian bittern has a small and rapidly declining population mainly due to the loss and destruction of its natural habitat (7). Its very specific habitat requirements means the Australasian bittern is very sensitive to loss of wetlands as areas have been drained for irrigation or to convert land to agriculture (2) (7).,In Australia there are already several sites dedicated to the management of the Australasian bittern population such as Bool Lagoon and Lake Muir (7). In 2007 a Bittern Project was set up which aims to study the Australasian bittern and its habitats raise awareness and educate the local community in an attempt to limit habitat destruction (7) (8). In Australia the Australasian bittern is protected under the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act (2).,,Day‰Ûªs big-eyed tree frog,Australian lace-lid ,Animalia,Chordata,Amphibia,Anura,Hylidae,Litoria (1),Litoria (1),[],[],,,,,,,,,,Australian sealion,Australian sea lion ,Animalia,Chordata,Mammalia,Carnivora,Otariidae,Neophoca (1),Neophoca (1),[],[],,,,,,,,,,priÌ«lo, SÌ£o Miguel Bullfinch,Azores bullfinch ,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Fringillidae,Pyrrhula (1),Size: 17 cm (2),The major causes of the decline of the Azores bullfinch are loss of native forest and large-scale invasion by exotic plants some of which are now so widespread that they have become <strong>naturalised</strong>. In particular laurel forest has been cut for grazing and agriculture and lost due to <strong>afforestation</strong> by Japanese red cedar (<i>Cryptomeria japonica</i>) (3). Food shortages are now a cause for concern throughout the year but most severe in late winter. The species has been left with an extremely small population and restricted range on just one island. The resulting reduced genetic variation may make it vulnerable to random environmental changes and inbreeding may reduce reproductive output (2). In addition predation by feral cats and rats is a potential problem although their impact is currently unknown (2) (3).,The Azores bullfinch is protected under Portuguese law and the area in which it is found in Pico da Vara has been designated a Natural Forest Reserve by the Regional Government of the Azores (2) (4). It was also designated a Special Protection Area by the Azorean Government under the EU Wild Birds Directive (4).,,,,,,,,,Azorean bat,Azores noctule ,Animalia,Chordata,Mammalia,Chiroptera,Vespertilionidae,Nyctalus (1),6 - 15 g (2),The main threats to the Azores noctule are thought to be human persecution and destruction of roost sites. This species' habit of flying during the daytime makes it particularly vulnerable to persecution as colonies are easy to locate (1).,Although no specific protective legislation exists in the Azores for this species the Azores noctule is currently listed under the Bern Convention and is included in Annex IV of the EU Habitats and Species Directive meaning this species is afforded some protection (1) (8) (9).,,,,,,,,,,Chalviande,Baboonwood ,Plantae,Tracheophyta,Magnoliopsida,Magnoliales,Myristicaceae,Virola (1),Virola (1),[],[],,,,,,,,,,Tapir De Baird,Baird's tapir ,Animalia,Chordata,Mammalia,Perissodactyla,Tapiridae,Tapirus (1),240 - 400 kg (2),Baird's tapir is primarily under threat from habitat loss throughout much of its former range. The low reproductive rate of this species means that populations are particularly vulnerable to disturbance such as habitat loss and hunting (5). Vast tracts of rainforest are being cleared to make way for cattle ranching and developments; almost all of the forest in El Salvador has been lost and there is no recent information to suggest that Baird's tapir persists in this country (5).,Baird's tapir the national symbol of Belize is protected in the majority of Central American countries although hunting laws are often poorly enforced (5). Populations are unable to withstand mass logging practices but have been known to survive and even prosper in areas where selective logging occurs which could be an important factor in their conservation (5). The IUCN/SSC Tapir Specialist Group has published a Species Action Plan identifying key actions required to protect this species; including species status surveys and the protection of habitat (5). Having persisted for millennia almost unchanged the continuing survival of the tapirs depends primarily on the maintenance of their habitat in some form.,,,,,,,,,,African cherry, cherry mahogany, makore,Baku ,Plantae,Tracheophyta,Magnoliopsida,Ebenales,Sapotaceae,Tieghemella (1),Height: c. 60 metres (2)Trunk diameter: up to 3 m (2),The beautiful baku is threatened by over-exploitation for its attractive wood (8) which is used as timber and in the production of musical instruments (2).  The forests of West Africa have been reduced to fragments due to harvesting and <strong>primary</strong> rainforests in C\xf4te d\u2019Ivoire Guinea Nigeria and Sierra Leone now cover less than ten percent of their original extent (2).  Ghana and Liberia both have a higher percentage of their natural forests remaining but even in these countries populations of baku have experienced significant declines and the extinction of this important species is a possibility (2).  Illegal and poorly controlled logging pose the greatest threat to the baku\u2019s continued existence (2) but it has also been reported that the reduction of forest elephant numbers in certain areas may limit the natural regeneration of baku (2) (8).,Baku trees are protected by law in C\xf4te d'Ivoire and due to the problem of overexploitation of timbers Ghana and Liberia have imposed bans on the exporting of baku in log form (8) (9).   Despite these measures improved regulation of the timber trade is still urgently required (2).  It has been recommended that re-planting in Liberia is necessary to prevent this species\u2019 extinction (8) and in all areas in which it is harvested certified sustainable forest management to Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) standards are required (2).  The Global Trees Campaign was set up with the aim of saving the world\u2019s most threatened tree species of which baku is one of and as a result Flora and Fauna International is currently working in Liberia with local and international partners to improve the basis for the conservation and sustainable management of forests (2).  Hopefully through the provision of information and the encouragement and support of sustainable-use operations (2) valuable and beautiful trees such as the baku can be conserved.,,,,,,,,Balabac chevrotain, Philippine mouse-deer,Balabac mouse deer ,Animalia,Chordata,Mammalia,Cetartiodactyla,Tragulidae,Tragulus (1),Tragulus (1),[],[],,,,,,,,,Guatambu, Guatambu Blanco,Balfourodendron ,Plantae,Tracheophyta,Magnoliopsida,Sapindales,Rutaceae,Balfourodendron (1),Balfourodendron (1),[],[],,,,,,,,,Banded ground cuckoo,Banded ground-cuckoo ,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Cuculiformes,Cuculidae,Neomorphus (1),Length: 50 cm (2),Rapid deforestation of the Choc\xf3 Biogeographical Region presents the greatest threat to the banded ground-cuckoo. Deforestation has intensified in this region since the mid-1970s along with increased road networks (4). Deforested land has been used for agriculture mainly bananas and cocoa cattle grazing at lower altitudes gold mining and conversion to palm oil plantations (4) (5).,The banded ground-cuckoo occurs in several protected areas which include Munchique National Park and El Pangan Nature reserve in Colombia. In Ecuador protected areas include Awacachi Biological Corridor Cotacachi-Cayapas Ecological Reserve Protective Forest Los Cedros and Jatun Sacha Bilsa Biological Reserve amongst others (4). However there are currently inadequate protection measures of the national parks in place by local governments and improved law enforcement is needed to prevent illegal logging and hunting (4) (5).,,,,,,,,,,munning,Banded hare-wallaby ,Animalia,Chordata,Mammalia,Diprotodontia,Macropodidae,Lagostrophus (1),Head-body length: 40 ‰ÛÒ 45 cm (2)Tail length: 35 ‰ÛÒ 40 cm (2)Average weight: 1.3 ‰ÛÒ 2.1 kg (2)Maximum male weight: 2.5 kg (2)Maximum female weight: 3.0 kg (2),The disappearance of the banded hare-wallaby on the Australian mainland is thought to be the combined result of clearing of vegetation for agriculture competition for food with introduced sheep and rabbits and predation by introduced predators such as cats (6) (7). Although these factors have caused a dramatic decline in numbers of the banded hare-wallaby causing their extinction on the mainland those that remain on the uninhabited islands of Dorre and Bernier thankfully remain relatively secure (6).,Unfortunately attempts made to reintroduce this species to Dirk Hartog Island in the 1970s and to Peron Peninsula at Shark Bay in 2001 failed. Cat predation played an important part in these failures as well as intensive browsing by sheep and goats and a period of drought over the summer of 1979/80 on Dirk Hartog resulting in the loss of 30 to 40 percent of the <i>Acacia </i>shrub cover. Captive populations are currently held at the Peron Captive Breeding Facility and the Dryandra Captive Breeding Facility though the latter has experienced problems with aerial predation by the wedge-tailed eagle (8). At last in 2003 and 2004 banded hare-wallabies from Peron Captive Breeding Facility and the Shark Bay Islands were successfully reintroduced to Faure Island after the removal of goats from the island (8) (9). This population is now thriving and represents a remarkable victory for conservation. Banded hare-wallabies have been so successful in adapting to their new environment that they bred in the first year after release providing fresh hope for the long-term survival of this relic species of \u2018short faced kangaroo\u2019 (9).,,,,,,,,,,Cormoran des bancs,Bank cormorant ,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Pelecaniformes,Phalacrocoracidae,Phalacrocorax (1),1.8 kg (2),Between 1978 and 1997 the number of breeding pairs of bank cormorant decreased by around 50% (6). The greatest declines occurred at the breeding colonies on Mercury and Ichaboe Islands in Namibia (6). It is thought that severe food shortages may be the primary reason for these severe losses (6). One of the bank cormorant\u2019s main food sources the pelagic goby is not targeted by the commercial fishery but following a severe <strong>Benguela Ni\xf1o</strong> event in 1994 stocks in central Namibia collapsed and have not sufficiently recovered since (8).,Whilst the threatened bank cormorant is not listed on the Convention of Migratory Species (CMS) it is part of the African-Eurasian Waterbird Agreement (AEWA) set up under the auspices of the CMS. Parties to AEWA are required to undertake a wide range of conservation actions described in a detailed Action Plan to protect waterbirds that cross international borders. Conservation actions include habitat conservation management of human activities research monitoring and education (9).,,,,,,,,,,Touraco de Bannerman, Touraco dorÌ©,Bannerman‰Ûªs turaco ,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Cuculiformes,Musophagidae,Tauraco (1),200 ‰ÛÒ 250 g (2),Bannerman\u2019s turaco is severely threatened by habitat destruction with the Kilum-Ijim forest having halved in size between 1963 and 1986 (5) and the remaining forest still being cleared or modified (2). Forest fires are a major cause of habitat loss as well as forest clearance for agriculture grazing firewood and timber. Since this species seems reluctant to cross open habitats the small pockets of birds that remain in forest fragments are in imminent danger of extinction (5). As a result Bannerman\u2019s turaco is only thought likely to survive if the c.100 square km of forest on Mount Oku (Kilum-Ijim forest) is preserved (2).,With the support of the BirdLife International Kilum-Ijim Forest Project local communities are now actively involved in conserving montane forest (2) (5). The condition of the forest and its endemic birds are monitored as well as the overall extent of forest cover in the Bamenda Highlands. In 2000 community-based conservation activities were also extended to other forest fragments in the Bamenda Highlands (5). Alternatives to forest clearance have been offered to farmers such as bee-keeping with the honey produced fetching a good price at local markets and plentiful honey requiring a healthy forest (2).,,,,,,,,,Tembadau,Banteng ,Animalia,Chordata,Mammalia,Cetartiodactyla,Bovidae,Bos (1),600 - 800 kg (2),The most significant threats facing banteng are hunting and habitat degradation and loss (1). Extinction is thought imminent in Vietnam and in Cambodia and Lao PDR habitat fragmentation caused by agriculture and new settlements is seriously threatening the remaining mainland Asian populations (3). These wild cattle have been domesticated in numerous locations most notably on the island of Bali with over 1.5 million domestic banteng thought to exist (2). Interbreeding with domestic and feral cattle threatens to contaminate the gene pool by hybridization of the remaining wild banteng and disease transmission from domestic livestock is also considered a serious danger (1) (6). The number of banteng trophies reported for sale within Cambodia and the Lao PDR along the Thai/Cambodia Thai/Lao and Thai/Myanmar borders strongly suggests that the banteng population on the mainland has been and remains under considerable pressure from hunters (2) (3). Despite legal prohibitions against trade in banteng law enforcement is inadequate and poaching and illegal trade in their meat and horns remains widespread (6) (7).,The banteng is legally protected across its range and occurs in a number of protected areas (1). However the natural resources of reserves often continue to be exploited with about 12 banteng poached annually for example in Baluran National Park Java (7). Several on-going field survey programmes exist (e.g. in Indochina) and a monitoring programme is conducted in East Java. A large captive population is maintained world-wide (1) with European zoos first importing captive banteng from collections in Indonesia as early as 1867 (4). Such populations provide a buffer against total extinction offer potential for future reintroductions into the wild and can be managed to maintain the genetic diversity of the species. In addition they now have a new and exciting role that utilises the very cutting edge of technology and scientific knowledge \u2013 cloning! For the first time on April 1st 2003 a healthy clone of this endangered species was born offering powerful evidence that cloning technology can play a role in preserving and even reconstituting threatened and endangered species (8).,,,,,,,,,,PÌ©trel de Barau,Barau‰Ûªs petrel ,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Procellariiformes,Procellariidae,Pterodroma (1),Length: 38 cm (2),Mammals introduced to the island of R\xe9union are believed to be impacting the Baraus\u2019 petrel; eggs and chicks are preyed on by rats and cats and goats may trample burrows and disturb suitable nesting habitat (2) (5). However the extent to which this threatens the species is not clear; the remote rugged habitat of breeding colonies may have limited access for these alien species (3). In the last 50 or so years urban development on the island has led to a dramatic increase in the number and intensity of streetlights and other bright lights which confuse large numbers of fledging Barau\u2019s petrels on their way to the sea at night. Grounded birds are then usually killed by vehicles or predated by dogs and cats. An additional potential threat comes from the increasing pressure for tourism to remote areas which could result in human disturbance at the nesting colonies (5).,A campaign was implemented to raise public awareness of the effect of urban lighting on petrels and to rescue as many grounded birds as possible. Each year many Barau\u2019s petrels are now found and rescued with increasing success; in 2001 787 petrels were rescued (2) (5). There are also proposals to reduce light pollution on the island (2). Increasing tourism suggests that conservation efforts should include strict regulation of human activities near the colonies particularly hiking and mountaineering. Efforts should also be made to eradicate potential predators from the nesting colonies (5).,,,,,,,,,,Barbary ape, rock ape,Barbary macaque ,Animalia,Chordata,Mammalia,Primates,Cercopithecidae,Macaca (1),Male head-and-body length: 55 ‰ÛÒ 70 cm (2)Female head-and-body length: 45 ‰ÛÒ 55 cm (2)Male weight: 7 ‰ÛÒ 12 kg (exceptionally up to 15) (2)Female weight: 5 ‰ÛÒ 9 kg (2)Tail length: 1 ‰ÛÒ 2 cm (2),This species is threatened by habitat loss from logging and human settlements as well as hunting (8). In Algeria forest fires and livestock grazing are additional problems and some young animals are captured as pets. In Morocco the problems of logging and overgrazing are exacerbated by drought. Moroccan forestry authorities have considered culling macaques because of their bark stripping. They were once found throughout North Africa but now only exist in small areas (9).,Seen as a symbol of Gibraltar and valued as a tourist attraction these macaques are protected to some extent (4). In Algeria this species is protected in several national parks but there are few active conservation policies elsewhere. There have been proposals to <strong>re-introduce</strong> them to the Kouf National Park in Libya and also to <strong>re-introduce</strong> them to Tunisia (9). The World Conservation Union recommends further population studies of the Barbary macaque and also the investigation of the bark-stripping problem in Morocco. National park protection must also be implemented more effectively (9).,,,,,,,,,Spotted rock catfish,Barnard's rock-catfish ,Animalia,Chordata,Actinopterygii,Siluriformes,Austroglanididae,Austroglanis (1),Length: up to 75 mm (2),Although no estimates have been made of the overall Barnard\u2019s rock-catfish population size it is believed to be decreasing (1). Agricultural development in the form of stream channelisation and water extraction for crops is destroying the shallow and fast-flowing habitat required by this species for feeding and breeding (3). Unsustainable water extraction has caused the river to completely dry up in some areas (1).,More research needs to be undertaken on the biology of this species in particular relationships with alien predators and competitors in order to better understand how best to conserve it (3). In addition due to the specific habitat requirements of Banard\u2019s rock catfish special care must be taken in conservation strategies to maintain its preferred habitat of clean fast-flowing water (3). The conservation of this species is linked with the overall management of the Olifants River system and conservation of all three <strong>endemic</strong> <em>Austroglanis</em>species is of great importance in order to maintain the functioning of the small <strong>endemic</strong> river community (3).,,,,,,,,,,barn-door skate, barndoor winter skate, barn-door winter skate,Barndoor skate ,Animalia,Chordata,Chondrichthyes,Rajiformes,Rajidae,Dipturus (1),up to 20 kg (1) (2),Although not specifically targeted by fisheries the barndoor skate has often been taken as <strong>bycatch</strong> in commercial trawl nets and as part of a complex of several skate species fished in USA waters. There is also a directed fishery for dogfish and skates on the Georges Bank which is thought to have led to a decline in this species. The flesh of this and other skates is used as lobster bait fish meal and pet food and the meat from its \u2018wings\u2019 (the <strong>pectoral fins</strong>) is sold as seafood (1) (2) (3) (4).,Since it was reported to be near to extinction in 1998 (7) the status of the barndoor skate has been the subject of much debate and a number of petitions have been made to list the species under the US Endangered Species Act (1) (2). The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) listed the barndoor skate as a \u2018Species of Concern\u2019 (4) but it was removed from the list in early 2010 after it was decided that there was no evidence the species was in imminent danger of extinction (8). There has been a ban on possession of the species in US waters (3) (4) and most significantly no-take zones in areas such as Georges Bank appear to have led to decreased mortality (9) and an increase in the number of juveniles (1) (2) (3) suggesting that areas protected from trawling would be effective in allowing the barndoor skate population to recover (1) (2) (7). This large skate may also benefit from further research to better understand its conservation status and the threats it faces.,,,,,,,,Rousserolle de Basra,Basra reed warbler ,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Sylviidae,Acrocephalus (1),Acrocephalus (1),[],[],,,,,,,,,,Long-billed black-cockatoo, white-tailed black-cockatoo,Baudin‰Ûªs black cockatoo ,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Psittaciformes,Psittacidae,Calyptorhynchus (1),560 - 770 g (2),Up to a quarter of this species\u2019 habitat has been cleared for agriculture causing considerable historical population declines. Logging of marri first for woodchips and now for use in flooring and furniture has dramatically reduced the availability of food and nesting trees. Additionally many nest hollows have been found to be occupied by <strong>feral</strong> bees which not only limit the bird\u2019s nest availability but are also known to have caused the loss of chicks and killed a brooding female. Competition for nests from maned geese (<i>Chenonetta jubatta</i>) and Australian shelduck (<i>Tadorna tadornoides</i>) may also be a factor as duck numbers increase in the south-west (9) (12).,Baudin\u2019s black cockatoo is listed under Appendix II of CITES limiting international trade in the species (3) and it is illegal to take these birds from the wild with a penalty of up to a maximum of $10000 for such an offence (12) (13). This cockatoo is given special protection under <i>Western Australia\u2019s Wildlife Conservation Act 1950</i> (4) and has been protected under Australian law since 1996 (9). Forest management has now changed so that woodchipping practices ceased in 2003 (9) (10). However the bird still clings to a precarious existence and further conservation measures are desperately required to safeguard its future including: making all shooting by commercial orchard farmers illegal; developing non-lethal methods of damage control; developing and implementing a feral bee control strategy; and protecting mature marri trees relied upon so heavily as nest and food sources by this rare <strong>endemic</strong> bird (9). A Recovery Plan is also being prepared to help conserve this species (12).,,,,,,,,,BaudÌ_ guan,Baudo guan ,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Galliformes,Cracidae,Penelope (1),Penelope (1),[],[],,,,,,,,,,Gymnostinops cassini,Baudo oropendola ,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Icteridae,Psarocolius (1),Psarocolius (1),[],[],,,,,,,,,,rufous-breasted cuckoo,Bay-breasted cuckoo ,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Cuculiformes,Cuculidae,Coccyzus (1),Coccyzus (1),[],[],,,,,,,,,,Mata Buey, Matabuey,Beautiful Goetzea ,Plantae,Tracheophyta,Magnoliopsida,Solanales,Goetzeaceae,Goetzea (1),Goetzea (1),[],[],,,,,,,,,Bufo travancoricus,Beddome‰Ûªs toad ,Animalia,Chordata,Amphibia,Anura,Bufonidae,Bufo (1),Bufo (1),[],[],,,,,,,,,,Peninsular yellowthroat,Belding‰Ûªs yellowthroat ,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,"	Passeriformes","	Parulidae",Geothlypis (1),,,,,,,,,,,,,,Length:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,14 cm (2) (3),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,\r\n\tAlthough recent surveys have found Belding\u2019s yellowthroat to occur at more sites than previously thought the total area it occupies is still tiny with suitable areas of habitat very limited and severely fragmented\xa0(2)\xa0(3).

The conversion of forest to agricultural land using <strong>slash-and-burn</strong> techniques is commonplace around the Tsingy de Bemaraha National Park and in some places the forest has been reduced to just a few metres width. The southern border of the national park is also under pressure from annual bushfires which limit the forest\u2019s regenerative potential. As this lemur is confined to this area there is increasing concern about the status of this little known species (6). A population around the village of Ankinajao is already believed to have become extinct due to excessive logging and its total range is now probably no more than 5000 square kilometres (1) (6).,The improvement of legal enforcement within the Tsingy de Bemaraha National Park should give this species a degree of sanctuary from some threats such as hunting and will potentially secure the species\u2019 habitat. As there is still a dearth of data regarding the ecology and distribution of this little known yet curious species further efforts are required to prevent additional declines (1).\xa0,,,,,,,,Black mantilla, Tolongoina golden frog,Bernhard‰Ûªs mantella ,Animalia,Chordata,Amphibia,Anura,Mantellidae,Mantella (1),Mantella (1),[],[],,,,,,,,,OrnithoptÌ¬re MÌ©ridional,Birdwing butterfly ,Animalia,Arthropoda,Insecta,Lepidoptera,Papilionidae,Ornithoptera (1),Ornithoptera (1),[],[],,,,,,,,,,Biznaguita de la caÌ±ada,Biznaguita ,Plantae,Tracheophyta,Magnoliopsida,Caryophyllales,Cactaceae,Mammillaria (1),Mammillaria (1),[],[],,,,,,,,,,Golden-rumped lion tamarin,Black lion tamarin ,Animalia,Chordata,Mammalia,Primates,Callitrichidae,Leontopithecus (1),540 ‰ÛÒ 690 g (2),Over 90 percent of the Atlantic forest in Brazil has been lost to logging development and cultivation. The species is also vulnerable to fire and hunting (4). Areas of prime habitat occur in and around the Morro do Diabo State Park; however five percent of this area was flooded in the early 1980's following the construction of a hydroelectric plant (7). The remaining black lion tamarin populations have been isolated for some time and studies have shown that genetic diversity is extremely low as a result of inbreeding (7). <strong>Inbreeding depression</strong> which can reduce the fitness of the population in terms of survival reproductive capacity and growth is therefore a cause for concern in this species.,A long-term programme of conservation and environmental education targeting the black lion tamarin is underway (7). An important measure to combat the effects of inbreeding will be to allow movement of individuals between the isolated sub-populations. This can occur through <strong>translocations</strong> of individuals or by creating corridors between habitat patches to facilitate movement between populations (4). Corridors have already been planted and some translocations have occurred (7). There is currently a captive population of around 100 individuals which require the occasional incorporation of wild individuals to maintain genetic variation (7).,,,,,,,,,,Malabar torrent toad, ornate stream toad,Black torrent toad ,Animalia,Chordata,Amphibia,Anura,Bufonidae,Ghatophryne (1),Ghatophryne (1),[],[],,,,,,,,,Gaviota MaorÌ_,Black-billed gull ,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Charadriiformes,Laridae,Larus (1),190 ‰ÛÒ 270 g (2),Despite a substantial decline on South Island over the past ten to twenty years the black-billed gull remains more common on South Island than North Island where it has actually expanded its range since the 1970s. It is hoped that its overall declining trend has reversed recently partly due to a change in agricultural practices that has seen more insects and worms being revealed by ploughing. The black-billed gull has developed a habit of following ploughs and aiding farmers by picking out insect pests. However the breeding habitat of the bird continues to decline in size. This reduction in habitat is the cause of the drop in gull numbers over the last 30 years as land is increasingly turned over to agriculture. Additionally breeding habitat is currently threatened by the spread of exotic lupins which clog the waterways (2) (5).,The New Zealand Government has launched the New Zealand Biodiversity Strategy to respond to its obligations under the Convention on Biological Diversity. This includes management of wetland habitats by protecting them from development as well as by planting appropriate plant species in areas recovering from disturbance in order to stabilise the soil and reduce fertiliser run-off that can encourage the growth of exotic species such as lupins at the expense of native species. The water level must be maintained and a water care code has been established to ensure that users of wetland habitats are able to act responsibly (6).,,,,,,,,,,black-breasted hill turtle, Chinese leaf turtle, Indo-Chinese serrated turtle, scalloped leaf turtle, Spengler's turtle, Vietnamese leaf turtle, Vietnamese wood turtle,Black-breasted leaf turtle ,Animalia,Chordata,Reptilia,Testudines,Bataguridae,Geoemyda (1),Carapace length: up to 11.5 cm (2),Like most Asian turtle species the black-breasted leaf turtle is in grave danger of extinction due to over-collection from the wild for the food medicine and pet trade. Turtles are highly prized for food and traditional \u2018medicinal\u2019 purposes and are ubiquitous in Asian food markets (9). Importation to the U.S. for the pet trade began in the 1980s and most specimens found in pet stores today are still freshly imported from Asia (6) although there is now substantial breeding of the species in China and some of the young exported into the global pet trade may come from farms (2). Nevertheless before reaching their destination many of these turtles have had to endure poor conditions in food markets and are malnourished or develop pneumonia mouth sores or other illnesses and almost all will have parasites from which many die (6). Another important factor in this species\u2019 decline is forest loss and degradation from clearance for agriculture and uncontrolled wildfires (2). Thus the high mortality rate amongst wild-caught leaf turtles combined with unsustainable rates of harvesting from the wild limited use of captive breeding and farming and ongoing habitat loss has led to a serious decline in population numbers and left this enigmatic turtle clinging to a precarious existence (9).,Substantial advances are being made in management and captive breeding of this turtle particularly in central Europe and the U.S. and captive breeding meets most of the serious hobbyist demand. However it remains cheaper to import animals for a few dollars/euros than to obtain captive-bred animals so the cheap pet imports continue and continue to be bought by impulse buyers (2). This pet market combined with habitat loss and the ongoing demand for turtles in the Asian food markets mean the outlook for the black-breasted leaf turtle and most Asian turtle species remains grim (9).,,,,Chanwan LasÌ©l, DiablotÌ_n,Black-capped petrel ,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Procellariiformes,Procellariidae,Pterodroma (1),Length: 40 cm (2)Wingspan: 96 cm (3),Up until the latter half of the 19th century the black-capped petrel was relatively common within its breeding range (3) (10). Around this time a burgeoning human population in the Caribbean islands and consequential habitat loss harvesting for food and predation by introduced mammals saw petrel numbers crash almost to the point of extinction. Indeed for several decades prior to the early 1960s the species appeared to have vanished completely. Fortunately in 1963 an estimated 2000 breeding pairs were discovered at the existing colonies in Haiti (7). It soon became evident however that these populations were under the same pressures that extirpated the breeding populations on other islands. By the turn of this century the estimated number of breeding pairs had declined to 1000 with a total population size of approximately 5000 birds (3). Despite increased awareness the population in Haiti is likely to continue to decline as a result of continued conversion of broadleaf forest to cropland and pasture at Parc La Visite. Sadly this downward population trend on the breeding grounds may be further exacerbated by proposals to develop oil and gas fields within petrel foraging grounds off the coast of the USA (2) (15).,Most of the known black-capped petrel breeding populations occur within La Visite National Park and Pic Macaya National Park in Haiti while Sierra de Baoruco National Park in the Dominican Republic also contains small populations (7) (8) (9) (10). However despite official park status the implementation of a sustainable conservation plan in Haiti\u2019s two national parks has no measurable conservation effect due to political instability corruption absence of political will and the abject poverty of the local population who depend critically on the forest for their day-to-day survival. Given that almost the world\u2019s entire black-capped petrel breeding population occurs within these two parks ensuring their protection presents the most critical challenge to conservation efforts (16). Current proposals for Haiti\u2019s National Parks include establishing core ecological reserves that are strictly off-limits to humans maintenance of defined park boundaries and long-term monitoring and research of avian populations (17) (18). However with Haiti\u2019s breeding populations still under threat the presence of alternative nesting sites may be crucial to the species\u2019 survival.,,,,,,,,,Black-cheeked ant tanager,Black-cheeked ant-tanager ,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Cardinalidae,Habia (1),Habia (1),[],[],,,,,,,,,,Manorina flavigula melanotis,Black-eared miner ,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Meliphagidae,Manorina (1),Length: 23 - 26 cm (2),The major cause of the black-eared miner decline is habitat loss and fragmentation. Much of the eucalypt mallee in its former range was cleared for agriculture in the early 20th century by European settlers (2). This habitat alteration has led to the closely related yellow-throated miner (<em>Manorina flavigula</em>) which favours disturbed and cleared habitatscolonising areas within the black-eared miner\u2019s range and contact between the two species has led to <strong>hybridisation</strong>. Interbreeding between the two species is currently the greatest threat to the black-eared miner and there are now thought to be very few \u2018pure\u2019 black-eared miner colonies left (2) (4).,Although currently classified as Endangered the black-eared miner has actually improved in conservations status since 1994 when it was classified as Critically Endangered. This improvement in status is due to the discovery of large populations in the Bookmark Biosphere Reserve and numerous conservation actions (5).,,,,,,,,,,Putois ÌÛ Pieds Noirs,Black-footed ferret ,Animalia,Chordata,Mammalia,Carnivora,Mustelidae,Mustela (1),Head-body length: 31 - 41 cm (2)Tail length: 11 - 15 cm (2)Male weight: 1 kg (3)Female weight: 0.8 kg (3),The number of black-footed ferrets plummeted in the first half of the 20th century primarily as a result of habitat loss. Prairies have been modified for intensive agriculture and there is now less than two percent of the original ferret habitat left (3). The ferret's main prey prairie dogs were systematically poisoned in vast tracts of their habitat by a government eradication programme in the mid 1900s (5). Prairie dog burrows were thought to damage cropland and ferret numbers fell in direct proportion with the dramatic decline of their prey (3). The final threat to black-footed ferret numbers and perhaps the most pertinent today is disease particularly canine distemper and plague (3). Plague introduced to North America causes even greater devastation in populations of prairie dogs and ferrets than it caused in human populations of Europe and Asia (8).,The black-footed ferret was thought to be extinct in the 1970s until a last population was discovered in Meeteetse Wyoming in 1981 (5). Under initial protection measures this population increased in numbers but then became infected by canine distemper and plague which threatened to completely wipe out the species (5). As a last resort the final 18 wild animals were caught and brought into captivity between 1985 and 1987 and a successful captive-breeding programme has been running ever since (3) (8). The US Fish and Wildlife Service's revised 'Black-Footed Ferret Recovery Plan' of 1988 prescribed the long-term target of establishing ten or more separate self-sustaining wild populations aiming to have 1500 ferrets in the wild by 2010 (9). As of 2008 populations had been reintroduced to 18 sites and with up to 250 wild born individuals distributed amongst several of these populations the black-footed ferret was reclassified by the IUCN moving from Extinct in the Wild to Endangered (1). While this is a fantastic conservation success story wild ferret populations remain small (1) and conservation will need to continue if this species\u2019 future is to be secured.,,,,,,,,,,White-crested piping-guan,Black-fronted piping-guan ,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Galliformes,Cracidae,Pipile (1),1.1 ‰ÛÒ 1.4 kg (2),The black-fronted piping-guan is one of the most prized game birds of the Atlantic forest. Although it is illegal to hunt this species remaining populations are threatened by poaching even in protected areas.  Compounding the threat of hunting is the impact of habitat loss (2) (4).  90 percent of the Atlantic forest has already been cleared leaving little habitat for the black-fronted piping-guan (5). Remaining forest patches are under threat from legal and illegal conversion to agriculture and the construction of hydro-electric dams (2) (4).,The black-fronted piping-guan is protected by law in Brazil but this has little impact on the rate of poaching there. Similarly it is found in several state parks and reserves including Urugua-\xed Provincial Park and Iguaz\xfa National Park both in Misiones but the security offered by these has had little effect on bolstering the species\u2019 numbers. There are several captive breeding programmes which have had some success but reintroduction has so far been unsuccessful.  Awareness campaigns and the enforcement of anti-poaching measures seem to be the best hope for this species with regular surveying to follow its progress (2) (4).,,,,,,,,,,Chlidonias albostriatus,Black-fronted tern ,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Charadriiformes,Laridae,Sterna (1),88 ‰ÛÒ 96 g (2),Numbers of the black-fronted tern have decreased dramatically in the last forty years; there used to be tens of thousands and now there are about 5000 birds. Increased disturbance of breeding colonies is one of the main reasons of this decline caused by greater numbers of people animals and vehicles around rivers. Unfortunately black-footed terns will swiftly abandon their eggs and young if their breeding site is disturbed resulting in a very low number of chicks reaching maturity (5).,There are a number of measures currently in place to help halt the decline of this endangered tern. Project River Recovery managed by New Zealand\u2019s Department of Conservation is a restoration programme for the wildlife and plants of the braided rivers and wetlands around Twizel Tekapo and Omarama (8). As part of the project the Mackenzie River Basin is receiving protection and willows are being removed to restore the breeding habitat of black-fronted terns (7). Information signs have been erected close to large black-fronted tern colonies which aim to educate the public about the best way to enjoy and use the river while minimising the negative impacts on the birds (5).,,,,,,,,,,Central American spider monkey, Geoffroy‰Ûªs spider monkey, Mono Colorado, Panama spider monkey, red spider monkey,Black-handed spider monkey ,Animalia,Chordata,Mammalia,Primates,Atelidae,Ateles (1),Male head-and-body length: 39 ‰ÛÒ 63 cm (2)Female head-and-body length: 31 ‰ÛÒ 45 cm (2)Male tail length: 70 - 86 cm (2)Female tail length: 64 ‰ÛÒ 75 cm (2)Male weight: 7.4 ‰ÛÒ 9 kg (2)Female weight: 6 ‰ÛÒ 8 kg (2),The black-handed spider monkey which depends upon large areas of tall forest has suffered from habitat destruction through deforestation and conversion to agricultural lands (7) (8). The species is also hunted for food and the pet trade in Central America becoming locally extinct in most areas that are accessible to man (7) (8). Unfortunately the species is a rather vulnerable target due to its conspicuously large group numbers and noisy habits making it easy to find (8).,A Species Survival Plan has been created for the black-handed spider monkey which involves a cooperative breeding programme between a number of zoos working together to ensure the survival of the species (10). However although this monkey is classified overall as Least Concern on the IUCN Red List several <strong>subspecies</strong> are classified as Endangered or Critically Endangered and more <glos><i>in-situ</i></glos> conservation is needed if these <strong>subspecies</strong> are to be given a good chance of long-term survival in the wild.,,,,,,Myrmotherula erythronotos,Black-hooded antwren ,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passerifirmes,Thamnophilidae,Formicivora (1),Formicivora (1),[],[],,,,,,,,,,black-shanked douc langur, Black-shanked douc monkey,Black-shanked douc ,Animalia,Chordata,Mammalia,Primates,Cercopithecidae,Pygathrix (1),Head-body length: 55 ‰ÛÒ 63 cm (2)Tail length: 57 ‰ÛÒ 73 cm (2)Male weight: 11 kg (2)Female weight: 8 kg (2),Vietnam has been subject to rapid human population growth and has now lost 80 percent of its historical forest cover. The Vietnamese government has a policy of relocating landless northerners to the central highlands thereby subjecting the remaining forests to clearance and commercial logging. In addition the black-shanked douc is hunted for meat and for trade in the traditional Chinese \u2018medicine\u2019 industry. Populations of doucs are increasingly fragmented reducing the opportunity for gene flow which prevents <strong>inbreeding depression</strong> (2).,Whilst the black-shanked douc occurs in many wildlife reserves and national parks and is protected by at least 11 national laws law enforcement is weak and reserves are poorly guarded. This species is difficult to keep in captivity but captive breeding programs at San Diego and Cologne Zoo have been successful (2).,,,,,,,,,black-spectacled brush finch,Black-spectacled brush-finch ,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Emberizidae,Atlapetes (1),Length: 17.5 - 19 cm (2) (3),With its small range and fragmented distribution the main threat facing the black-spectacled brush-finch is habitat loss with areas of scrub and forest being burnt to create and maintain pastureland. However it is unlikely that this rate of habitat destruction is increasing as humans are steadily leaving the region for larger towns and cities (2) (4).,There are currently no known conservation measures in place for the black-spectacled brush-finch. However it has been proposed that this species would benefit from further research to give a better understanding of its population size and requirements as well as from measures to ensure that at least some of its habitat receives protection (2).,,,,,,,,,,BÌ_ho ManchÌ_,Blakiston's fish owl ,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Strigiformes,Strigidae,Ketupa (1),Length: 60 ‰ÛÒ 72 cm (2),Habitat loss is the major cause of the decline in Blakiston\u2019s fish owl numbers that has been documented throughout its range (5). Logging of these old forests has been rife and continues to threaten remaining populations today. These owls are targeted by hunters in Russia as they are believed to spoil the fur of trapped animals (5). The depletion of fish numbers through overfishing is also a pertinent threat to this bird of prey (5).,Blakiston\u2019s fish owl is legally protected in all of the countries within which it is found and occurs within a number of protected areas (2). On Hokkaido nest boxes and supplementary feeding regimes have been in place since 1984 and a captive breeding and release programme is also underway (5). Without the provision of adequate habitat however these measures are ultimately ineffective (5). It has been suggested that a National Park should be created in northern Russia which could help to secure some of the habitat in this region (5).,,,,,,,,,,Cistuda blandingii , Emys blandingii,Blanding's turtle ,Animalia,Chordata,Reptilia,Testudines,Emydidae,Emydoidea (1),Emydoidea (1),[],[],,,,,,,,,Whio,Blue duck ,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Anseriformes,Anatidae,Hymenolaimus (1),Length: 53 cm (2)Male weight: 1000 g (3)Female weight: 800 g (3),Habitat loss has been one of the major causes of decline in this species. The clearance and grazing of riverside vegetation has led to the depletion of water quality in many rivers and has restricted the blue duck to less accessible mountainous areas. Predation by introduced mammals such as stoats and competition with introduced trout may also have played a part in the decrease and fragmentation of this species\u2019 range (2).,The New Zealand Department of Conservation published a Blue Duck Recovery Plan in 1997 in an effort to secure the survival of this species in the wild and to downgrade its current threat status. Some of the conservation measures involved include captive breeding and release attempts and the protection of key areas of habitat. Ongoing population monitoring is also a priority in the conservation of this attractive waterbird (4).,,,,,,,,,,Latanier de l'Ile Ronde, Latanier de Niaurice,Blue latan palm ,Plantae,Tracheophyta,Liliopsida,Arecales,Palmae,Latania (1),Latania (1),[],[],,,,,,,,,Erogala caeruleus, Notropis caeruleus, Photogenis caeruleus,Blue shiner ,Animalia,Chordata,Actinopterygii,Cypriniformes,Cyprinidae,Cyprinella (1),Maximum size: 10 cm (2),Numbering no more than 2500 individuals the blue shiner population is suspected to have undergone a dramatic decline although the factors responsible for this are not entirely clear (5) (6). A decrease in water quality was probably the most significant agent as the loss of the species from the Cahaba River coincided with an increase in nitrogen and phosphorous caused by sewage discharge. This led to higher algal biomass and decreased levels of dissolved oxygen in the water (4) (5). The blue shiner is also threatened by increased siltation as it relies on sight to detect its prey while in Georgia urbanisation and resulting pollution and water extraction threatens the species\u2019 habitat. In many areas the blue shiner now exists in small highly fragmented populations which are more vulnerable to habitat degradation and a loss of <strong>genetic diversity</strong> greatly increasing the species\u2019 extinction risk (5) (7).,The future of the blue shiner very much depends on the protection of its habitat particularly the Conasauga River. Fortunately for this rare species efforts are underway to protect this fragile environment. The Nature Conservancy is working with private landowners and government agencies to protect the Conasauga River and conserve the populations of rare and endangered fish that inhabit its waters (5) (8). The National Resources Conservation Service is also working to protect <strong>riparian</strong> habitat around the Conasauga River and to tackle threats (5) (9).

However the advent of the exploding harpoon gun in 1868 allowed for the commercial exploitation of this species with the whaling industry particularly focusing on the blue whale after 1900 (9). The slaughter peaked in 1931 when over 29000 were killed in one season (8). After that blue whales became so scarce that the whalers turned to other species. More than 360000 blue whales were taken by whaling fleets in the Southern Hemisphere from 1904 to 1967 (7) and the Antarctic and North Atlantic populations were probably depleted to the low hundreds by the time whaling ceased (1). The total global blue whale population has declined by at least 70 percent and possibly as much as 90 percent over the last three generations with the formerly very large Antarctic population declining over the same period by as much as 97 percent (1).\xa0,Hunting of the blue whale was banned in 1966 although some illegal soviet whaling persisted for several years after. No blue whales have been deliberately caught since 1978 (1). However this protection almost came too late for the blue whale and recovery has been extremely slow.

Some factors believed to have contributed to this sharp decline are the international pet trade the fungal disease chytridiomycosis and <strong>larvae</strong> predation by an introduced fish species (1).,If the fungus that causes chytridiomycosis is actually more susceptible to pollution than the blue-sided tree frog is then actions typically taken to maintain habitat integrity for amphibians such as limiting pollution may actually hinder the blue-sided tree frog\u2019s ability to maintain wild populations (1).,,,,,,,Eleutherodactylus punctariolus, Hyla punctariola,Bob‰Ûªs robber frog ,Animalia,Chordata,Amphibia,Anura,Leptodactylidae,Craugastor (1),Craugastor (1),[],[],,,,,,,,,Arthroleptis horridus, Hemimantis horrida, Mantidactylus horridus , Trachymantis horrida, Trachymantis horridus,Boettgers grainy frog ,Animalia,Chordata,Amphibia,Anura,Mantellidae,Gephyromantis (1),Gephyromantis (1),[],[],,,,,,BogotÌÁ rail,Bogota rail ,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Gruiformes,Rallidae,Rallus (1),Rallus (1),[],[],,,,,,,,,,Eleutherodactylus merostictus,Bogotacito robber frog ,Animalia,Chordata,Amphibia,Anura,Strabomantidae,Pristimantis (1),Pristimantis (1),[],[],,,,,,,,,,Palma De Pasopaya,Bolivian mountain coconut ,Plantae,Tracheophyta,Liliopsida,Arecales,Palmae,Parajubaea (1),Parajubaea (1),[],[],,,,,,,,,,Inquisivi spinetail,Bolivian spinetail ,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Furnariidae,Cranioleuca (1),Cranioleuca (1),[],[],,,,,,,,,,Beni titi monkey, modest titi, Rio Beni titi,Bolivian titi ,Animalia,Chordata,Mammalia,Primates,Pitheciidae,Callicebus (1),Callicebus (1),[],[],,,,,,,,Pygmy chimpanzee,Bonobo ,Animalia,Chordata,Mammalia,Primates,Hominidae,Pan (1),Male head-body length: 73 - 83 cm (2)Female head-body length: 70 - 76 cm (2)Male weight: 40 ‰ÛÒ 45 kg (3)Female weight: c. 30 kg (3),Bonobos are not as widespread as their chimpanzee cousins and are threatened by loss of habitat as large areas of rainforest are being cleared to make way for agriculture for timber extraction and for development (1). Although traditionally not targeted by hunters as a result of local taboos (9) this species is today at risk from the bushmeat trade; the demand for which has recently increased threatening much of Africa's wildlife (2).,Bonobos are protected by law and international trade is prohibited by their listing on Appendix I of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) (3). <strong>Ex-situ</strong> conservation measures cannot be relied upon as a safeguard for this species as presently no self-sustaining captive population exists (2). The precise impact of the bushmeat trade is currently being investigated by the Bushmeat Working Group part of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) (7). The United Nations Environmental Program (UNEP) has recently recognised the urgent need to protect our closest relatives and has established a Great Ape Survival Project (GRASP) aimed at identifying the conservation initiatives required to secure the future of the apes and obtaining political support and funding to allow these to be achieved (8). The Bonobo Conservation Initiative is working in the Democratic Republic of Congo to raise awareness of the plight of this species (9). The main problem in terms of bonobo conservation is that they are only found in a single protected area (Salonga National Park) and even there they are intensively hunted both for their meat as well as for the making of charms (3). Concerted conservation efforts will therefore be required to secure the future of this fascinating ape.,,,,,,,,,,Bornean grey gibbon, Borneo gibbon, grey gibbon, MÌ_ller's gibbon,Bornean gibbon ,Animalia,Chordata,Mammalia,Primates,Hylobatidae,Hylobates (1),Hylobates (1),[],[],,,,,,,Espolonero de Borneo,Bornean peacock-pheasant ,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Galliformes,Phasianidae,Polyplectron (1),Polyplectron (1),The greatest threats to the Bornean peacock-pheasant are habitat loss and hunting (2).,The Bornean peacock-pheasant has been recorded in a number of protected areas within Borneo including Sungai Wain Nature Reserve and Danau Sentarum National Park (2).,,,,,,,,,,Bornean agile gibbon,Bornean white-bearded gibbon ,Animalia,Chordata,Mammalia,Primates,Hylobatidae,Hylobates (1),Hylobates (1),[],[],,,,,,,,,,bay cat, Bornean bay cat, Bornean marbled cat,Borneo bay cat ,Animalia,Chordata,Mammalia,Carnivora,Felidae,Pardofelis (1),Male head-body length: 45.5 - 67 cm (2)Female head-body length: 45.2 - 62 cm (2)Male tail length: 32.5 - 38.5 cm (2) (3)Female tail length: 32 - 40.3 cm (2)Estimated weight: 3 - 4 kg (3),The Borneo bay cat continues to be an exceptionally rare species (2). As this cat seems to prefer a forest habitat to some extent (2) (8) the large-scale deforestation occurring in parts of Malaysia (9) is likely to be threatening its numbers further (2). For example certain areas of Malaysian forests are decreasing at five percent per year (9).,The Borneo bay cat is currently listed under Appendix II of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) (2) (4) and has been recommended for inclusion under Appendix I which means that all commercial international trade in the cat would be stopped (2).

Its range is decreasing as forests are converted for agriculture cattle ranching and as urban areas expand. It is also sometimes captured for the pet trade (1).,This Endangered primate is thankfully receiving conservation attention from the Committee for the Conservation and Management of Amazonian Primates (1) and also from the Project for Conservation and Sustainable Use of Brazilian Biological Diversity (PROBIO) which includes a management plan for the Brazilian bare-faced tamarin (10). This species also occurs in a number of protected reserves in and around Manaus and has been bred in captivity; in 2004 there were 117 Brazilian bare-faced tamarins in captivity across 19 institutions (1). Whilst this captive breeding is important it should not replace the efforts being made to keep this species thriving in the wild.,,,,,,,,,pateke,Brown teal ,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Anseriformes,Anatidae,Anas (1),Length: 48 cm (2)Male weight: 620 ‰ÛÒ 700 g (3)Female weight: 530 ‰ÛÒ 600 g (3),Although the Maori killed brown teal in very large numbers when European settlers arrived in New Zealand in 1840 it was still the most abundant waterfowl species in the country. Europeans also hunted the brown teal excessively but it was the introduction of stoats weasels ferrets hedgehogs cats and dogs that caused the first major decline of this species. In 1921 the brown teal was declared a protected species but shooting continued and was compounded by extensive drainage of wetlands and deforestation leaving less than 10% of wetlands and 30% of native forests (3). The brown teal population stands today at just under 1000 individuals (5).,The New Zealand Department of Conservation has produced a brown teal recovery plan which is now in action. Five full time staff and a large team of volunteers monitor the ducks and control predators (3) (5). They also oversee a captive breeding programme and the resulting reintroductions. This programme has been extremely successful in producing captive-reared birds \u2013 for every bird taken from the wild 21.5 have been bred and released bringing the total number of reintroduced brown teal to 2000 since 1964 (3). Improvements in release techniques using supplementary feeders post-release and predator control at the release site has increased initial post-release survival rates to more than 60% (5). The captive breeding network in New Zealand consists of 20 holders made up of wildlife parks zoos and private individuals on a completely voluntary basis with no financial support. These collectively produce approximately 100 brown teal for release into the wild each year. This programme is now in the third year of releasing the birds into a major release site in Port Charles Coromandel which has proved very successful with 60 \u2013 70 percent survival rate of released birds which are now breeding and producing young in the wild themselves (5).,,,,,,,,,,black-eared parrotlet,Brown-backed parrotlet ,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Psittaciformes,Psittacidae,Touit (1),Touit (1),[],[],,,,,,,,,,Waigeo brush-turkey,Bruijn‰Ûªs brush-turkey ,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Galliformes,Megapodiidae,Aepypodius (1),Aepypodius (1),[],[],,,,,,,,,,Philautus alto,Bubble-nest frog ,Animalia,Chordata,Amphibia,Anura,Rhacophoridae,Philautus (1),Philautus (1),[],[],,,,,,,,,,Buff-breasted button-quail,Buff-breasted buttonquail ,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Gruiformes,Turnicidae,Turnix (1),Turnix (1),[],[],,,,,,,,,,buffy-cheeked gibbon, red-cheeked gibbon, yellow-cheeked crested gibbon,Buff-cheeked gibbon ,Animalia,Chordata,Mammalia,Primates,Hylobatidae,Nomascus (1),Nomascus (1),[],[],,,,,,,,Ouistiti ÌÛ TÌ»te Jaune,Buffy-headed marmoset ,Animalia,Chordata,Mammalia,Primates,Callitrichidae,Callithrix (1),230 ‰ÛÒ 453 g (2),Although believed to be a naturally rare species (4) the small range of the buffy-headed marmoset leaves it highly vulnerable to threats such as habitat destruction which is now pushing this diminutive monkey towards extinction.   A burgeoning population and rapid development along the southeastern coastal region of Brazil has taken its toll on the natural forest habitat (2) (6).  The clearance of land for coffee plantations sugar cane cocoa eucalyptus cattle pasture and most significantly timber extraction and charcoal production has left just a tiny fraction of original forest (6).  In addition this threatened primate may also be hunted for the pet trade (1).,Despite the grim picture painted for the future of the buffy-headed marmoset\u2019s habitat it has been reported that this species may be able to adapt to <strong>secondary forest</strong> and that its future could be secured if provided with proper protection (2).  Currently this species is known to occur within the Nova Lombardia Biological Reserve and the forest within the lands of the Fazenda Montes Claros (a privately owned farm) (6).  This provides the buffy-headed marmoset with some protection against the threats of habitat loss but it has been advised that the land of Fazenda Montes Claros should be made into an official protected area so that its future preservation can be assured (6).  Indeed the future of the buffy-headed marmoset may rest on the effective protection of strongholds such as these (6).,,,,,,,,,,Buglosse CrÌ©pu,Buglosse crÌ©pue ,Plantae,Tracheophyta,Magnoliopsida,Lamiales,Boraginaceae,Anchusa (1),Anchusa (1),[],[],,,,,,,,,,bois sandal,Bwa sandal ,Plantae,Tracheophyta,Magnoliopsida,Gentianales,Apocynaceae,Carissa (1),Height: up to 12 m (2),The beautiful bwa sandal has been pushed to extreme rarity by felling for the production of aromatic oils fuelwood (1) and to burn the aromatic wood which has the ability to deter mosquitoes and induce restful sleep (2) (4).  In addition habitat clearance is believed to be the cause of its extinction on Mah\xe9 (1).  Very few mature bwa sandal trees now remain and this small and restricted population is considered to be in danger of extinction (1).,All remaining populations of the bwa sandal occur within protected areas (1) but there is no information to indicate whether the protection is sufficient and well enough enforced to ensure the bwa sandal\u2019s survival.,,,,,,,,,,Eleutherodactylus cacao,Cacao robber frog ,Animalia,Chordata,Amphibia,Anura,Strabomantidae,Pristimantis (1),Pristimantis (1),[],[],,,,,,,,,,Erizo Gris,Cactus ,Plantae,Tracheophyta,Magnoliopsida,Caryophyllales,Cactaceae,Copiapoa (1),Copiapoa (1),[],[],,,,,,,,,,Cacto de la Serpiente,Cactus ,Plantae,Tracheophyta,Magnoliopsida,Caryophyllales,Cactaceae,Copiapoa (1),Copiapoa (1),[],[],,,,,,,,,,Pilocopiapoa solaris,Cactus ,Plantae,Tracheophyta,Magnoliopsida,Caryophyllales,Cactaceae,Copiapoa (1),Copiapoa (1),[],[],,,,,,,,,,Bermuda petrel,Cahow ,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Procellariiformes,Procellariidae,Pterodroma (1),Length: 38 cm (2),The huge pre-colonial cahow population was rapidly decimated by human hunting for food and by introduced pigs rats dogs and cats which eliminated it from all the larger islands (2) (4) (5). Surviving only on the smallest offshore islets where lack of soil prevented burrowing it was forced to compete for nest sites with the larger cliff-hole-nesting white-tailed tropicbird (<em>Phaethon lepturus</em>) which caused 70 percent breeding failure every year. Rat predation on new-hatched chicks remains as an occasional threat. During the 1960s and early 1970s before DDT pesticide use was banned DDT residues caused a 50 percent decline in breeding success due to eggshell thinning and embryo mortality (7). From the late 1960s through the 1990s light pollution from a nearby NASA tracking station and U.S. Naval air station inhibited new pair formation on the breeding islets (2). Erosion damage to the nesting islets from hurricane overwash has become a major problem due to global warming and sea level rise since 1995 (7).,The rediscovery of the Bermuda petrel\u2019s nesting grounds in 1951 enabled concerted conservation efforts and since 1961 all of the breeding sites have been intensively managed by a conservation officer employed by the Bermuda Government Ministry of the Environment. Periodic invasions of rats are controlled by trapping and baiting with anti-coagulant poisons and nest competition with tropicbirds has been eliminated by the installation of wooden entrances which exclude the larger tropicbirds. In addition man-made concrete burrows have been provided on the level tops of the islets to accommodate the cahow population increase. Furthermore since 1962 the six hectare soil-covered Nonsuch Island has been restored and kept predator-free as a much larger future home for the expanding population (7).,,,,,,,,,,Calamanian deer, Calamian hog deer, Philippine deer,Calamian deer ,Animalia,Chordata,Mammalia,Cetartiodactyla,Cervidae,Axis (1),27 ‰ÛÒ 110 kg (2),These beautiful deer are hunted by local people primarily for their meat although their hides are sometimes used for drum-skins and their antlers for decoration (7).  This hunting which was particularly severe during the mid-1970s but has declined in more recent years (7) has left Calamian deer populations seriously depleted (5).,The most significant conservation measures implemented for this Endangered species to date have been the establishment of the Calauit Island Game Preserve and Wildlife Sanctuary and the introduction of 30 deer to the island (7).  In 1993 the Calamian Deer Conservation Program was also launched an initiative which has led to the undertaking of status surveys research conservation education and the formation of management recommendations.  There are no reserves on Busuanga and Culion but relatively large parts of these islands fortunately remain undeveloped and sparsely inhabited (7).,,,,,,,,Chamaeleon gallus,Calumma ,Animalia,Chordata,Reptilia,Squamata,Chamaeleonidae,Calumma (1),Calumma (1),[],[],,,,,,,,,,Eugenia neoaustralis,Calycorectes ,Plantae,Tracheophyta,Magnoliopsida,Myrtales,Myrtaceae,Calycorectes (1),Calycorectes (1),[],[],,,,,,,,,,Cameroon praomys,Cameroon soft-furred mouse ,Animalia,Chordata,Mammalia,Rodentia,Muridae,Praomys (1),Praomys (1),[],[],,,,,,,,,,Campbell Island flightless teal,Campbell Island teal ,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Anseriformes,Anatidae,Anas (1),Male wingspan: 128 ‰ÛÒ 138 cm (2)Female wingspan: 114 ‰ÛÒ 125 cm (2)Male weight: 290 ‰ÛÒ 500 g (2)Female weight: 280 ‰ÛÒ 265 (2),Having disappeared from much of its former range the Campbell Island teal population reached critically low numbers\xa0and\xa0has clung to a precarious existence. This bird\u2019s extirpation from it presumed former stronghold Campbell Island has largely been attributed to predation by introduced Norway rats (<i>Rattus norvegicus</i>) that got ashore from sealing and whaling ships in the early 19th Century (4). Present-day potential threats include the accidental introduction of predators or avian disease to Dent Island the bird\u2019s last natural refuge or even severe weather conditions which could have a catastrophic effect (6). Indeed with such a small current population and limited natural range this bird is now extremely vulnerable; just a single event is capable of driving it to complete extinction (5).,The outlook for the Campbell Island teal looked bleak when first rediscovered in 1975 but thankfully since then there has been fantastic progress with captive breeding programmes and the population has increased to a healthier though still unstable level (5). Captive breeding was started by New Zealand\u2019s Department of Conservation in 1984 from three males and one female taken from the small population on Dent Island and another four males and three females captured in 1990. The first duckling finally hatched in 1994 at the Pukaha Mt Bruce National Wildlife Centre receiving international attention and by 2000 the captive population had reached 60 (4). The Department of Conservation initially released a total of 24 captive-bred birds on to the predator-free Codfish Island in 1999 and 2000 as an insurance population and to be eventually used to restock Campbell Island (4) (5). These had an 88 percent survival rate. With this success the Department of Conservation decided to translocate captive-bred birds directly to Campbell Island made viable by a successful rat and cat eradication programme in 2001 (4). Thus 50 teal including 28 from Pukaha Mount Bruce and 22 from Codfish Island were released onto Campbell Island in September 2004 and a further 55 in September 2005 and 54 in 2006 (4) (5). A check in February 2005 found no evidence that the first batch of released birds had bred but this may be due to their being moved close to the breeding season (4). Two decades of conservation effort have brought this bird back from extinction on Campbell Island and meant that it now has a good chance of being able to recover and thrive once more in its native home (7).,,,,,,,,,,Canary shrew,Canarian shrew ,Animalia,Chordata,Mammalia,Eulipotyphla,Soricidae,Crocidura (1),6 - 9.5 g (2),Sadly the Canarian shrew is an Endangered species and the population on Monta\xf1a Clara consists of fewer than 100 individuals. This species is highly vulnerable due to its restricted distribution and specific habitat requirements (1) (2) and has already become extinct on the islands of Graciosa and Alegranza (4).,As well as being listed on Appendix II of the Bern Convention (8) and Annex IV of the EU Habitats Directive (9) the Canarian shrew is protected under Spanish law and its range includes National Parks in Fuerteventura (1).,,,,,,,,,,Eleutherodactylus rhodoplichus,Canchaque robber frog ,Animalia,Chordata,Amphibia,Anura,Strabomantidae,Pristimantis (1),Pristimantis (1),[],[],,,,,,,,,,Palo De Velas, Velario,Candle tree ,Plantae,Tracheophyta,Magnoliopsida,Scrophulariales,Bignoniaceae,Parmentiera (1),Parmentiera (1),[],[],,,,,,,,,Plectronia celastroides,Canthium ,Plantae,Tracheophyta,Magnoliopsida,Rubiales,Rubiaceae,Canthium (1),Canthium (1),[],[],,,,,,,,,,cane warbler, Cape Verde cane warbler, Cape Verde cane-warbler, Cape Verde Islands cane warbler, Cape Verde Islands warbler, Cape Verde swamp warbler, Cape Verde swamp-warbler, Dohrn‰Ûªs swamp-warbler,Cape Verde warbler ,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Sylviidae,Acrocephalus (1),15 - 17 g (2),One reason for the decline in the Cape Verde warbler is thought to be the loss of its habitat which has been caused by consecutive droughts and a greater number of people now living on the islands. This species is also threatened by disease and environmental disasters particularly as its entire population is restricted to just three small islands (3).,There are no current conservation activities in place for the Cape Verde warbler although Wildlife Protection Laws were drawn up in the late 1980s.

The main reason for this is the clearance of native vegetation for agriculture which has severely reduced and fragmented this species\u2019 habitat (4) (8). In some cases parts of south-western Western Australia have lost over 90 percent of their original vegetation with the remainder being scattered in numerous patches of varying size and quality (12).,Carnaby\u2019s black-cockatoo is legally protected in Australia (2) (4) and international trade in this species should be strictly controlled under its listing on Appendix II of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) (6). A Recovery Plan has been prepared for Carnaby\u2019s black-cockatoo and in 1999 a Carnaby\u2019s Black-Cockatoo Recovery Team was appointed to coordinate conservation efforts for this species (8).Alexandria false antechinus, carpentarian antechinus,Carpentarian pseudantechinus ,Animalia,Chordata,Mammalia,Dasyuromorphia,Dasyuridae,Pseudantechinus (1),Pseudantechinus (1),[],[],,,,,,,,,Cyren's rock lizard, Iberian rock lizard, Spanish mountain lizard,Carpetane rock lizard ,Animalia,Chordata,Reptilia,Squamata,Lacertidae,Iberolacerta (1),6 ‰ÛÒ 10 g (2),Like many other Spanish mountain lizards this species has a very restricted range that makes it highly vulnerable to habitat degradation and loss (4). The distribution of the Carpetane rock lizard is now severely fragmented and there is an ongoing decline in the extent and quality of its habitat particularly due to alpine tourism and the construction of ski resorts (5) as well as road construction all-terrain vehicle use and overgrazing by cattle (1) (4). Additionally as with all montane species there is a concern that climate change could pose a serious threat in the future (1) (4).,The Carpetane rock lizard occurs in two protected areas: the Sierra del Guadarrama Natural Park and Sierra de Gredos Natural Park (1).,,,,,,,,Phoca caspica,Caspian seal ,Animalia,Chordata,Mammalia,Carnivora,Phocidae,Pusa (1),up to 86 kg (2) (3),Believed to have numbered over a million at the start of the 20th Century the Caspian seal has since undergone a dramatic decline of over 90 percent due to a range of human activities (1) (8) (9) and current losses still substantially exceed recruitment of young into the population (12). The species is particularly vulnerable as the Caspian Sea is a closed system from which the seal cannot disperse (1). The main threat to the Caspian seal is intensive commercial hunting (2) (3) (5) (9) (10) which although now regulated is still likely to exceed sustainable harvest levels (1). Illegal killing and poaching also occur (8). Intensive fishing is also a problem reducing fish stocks and resulting in seals being caught as <strong>bycatch</strong> injured by boats or deliberately killed by fishermen (1) (2) (8) (9) (10). Fish stocks are also under further threat from the voracious comb jellyfish <i>Mnemiopsis leidyi</i> which invaded the Caspian Sea via ship ballast in 1999 and which rapidly consumes <strong>zooplankton</strong> as well as fish eggs and young (1) (9) (13).,A range of measures have been put in place during the last century to protect the Caspian seal such as a ban on seal nets and restrictions on hunting including the protection of adult females during the breeding season (1) (11). However legal hunting for commercial and scientific purposes still continues (1). A number of conservation projects are in place in the region including the Caspian Environment Programme (CEP) which aims to halt environmental degradation in the Caspian Sea and promote sustainable development (4) (7) and the Caspian Seal Project which is supported by bodies such as the UK Darwin Initiative and which aims to monitor the Caspian seal population work for its conservation and raise its profile as a flagship species for the region. As part of this a Seal Conservation Action and Management Plan (SCAMP) has been developed although its most important recommendations have yet to be implemented (1) (9). The Caspian Seal Conservation Network (CSCN) is also coordinating research into the species (9).,,,,,,,,,,Dendrobates bombetes,Cauca poison frog ,Animalia,Chordata,Amphibia,Anura,Dendrobatidae,Ranitomeya (1),Ranitomeya (1),[],[],,,,,,,,,,Caucasus viper,Caucasian viper ,Animalia,Chordata,Reptilia,Squamata,Viperidae,Vipera (1),Body length: up to 60 cm (2),For centuries fear-driven human persecution of the Caucasian viper has diminished population numbers (2). Today this snake is also threatened by illegal capture for the international pet trade habitat loss to urbanisation agriculture dam construction in Georgia and increased tourism-based development on the coast of the Black Sea (1). As a result of these threats populations have declined significantly and some have been lost altogether. If this rate of decline continues the Caucasian viper population is likely to be halved by 2018 (1).,The Caucasian viper is subject to state and regional level legal protection (7) and some areas of its habitat are protected such as Soci National Park which contains Russia\u2019s largest population of the Caucasian viper. Other protected areas such as Kackazsky State Biosphere Reserve Russia are home to small populations but these remain threatened as these reserves are also tourist destinations. Education of visitors and park staff is therefore vital in areas such as these to allow conservation of the Caucasian viper (7). A few individuals of the species also occur in small protected areas in Turkey and Georgia although overall most Caucasian viper populations remain unprotected (1) (7). Therefore it is thought an increase in the extent and quality of reserves is needed including international cooperation to establish a network of protected areas along the coast of the Black Sea (7).,,,,,,,,,,Cayman Island ground iguana, Grand Cayman blue iguana, Grand Cayman iguana,Cayman Island blue iguana ,Animalia,Chordata,Reptilia,Squamata,Iguanidae,Cyclura (1),Male snout-to-vent length: up to 51.5 cm (2)Female snout-to-vent length: up to 41.0 cm (2),Once abundant the Cayman Island blue iguana has been quietly heading for extinction in the wild since the colonization of the West Indian islands (4). Like other iguana species this beautiful creature is subject to many human-related threats including: destruction of habitats for farming residential and commercial developments; road casualties; trapping or shooting by farmers who perceive iguanas as a threat to their crops; and predation by wild and domestic cats and dogs (4) (7). Large scale deforestation and road construction has also increased enormously in the eastern districts over the last decade and is only expected to accelerate (7).,The Cayman Island blue iguana is fully protected under local legislation and kept out of international trade by its listing on Appendix I of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) (1). The National Trust for the Cayman Islands has established an integrated conservation programme incorporating research habitat protection captive breeding re-introduction/restocking and conservation education (7). These iguanas are being bred successfully in captivity and are subsequently released after two years into the Queen Elizabeth II Botanic Park and Salina Reserve (1) (4). Blue iguana populations in this reserve are being promoted as a major ecotourism attraction proving beneficial to both the Park and the iguanas (1). It seems that the future of wild blue iguanas must rest on managed populations in protected areas but suitable land is scarce on Grand Cayman (4). Thus despite encouraging conservation efforts the Cayman Island blue iguana still clings to a precarious existence (5) and more protected land must be obtained if there is any hope of securing its future in the wild (4).,,,,,,,,Guarumo Amarillo, Guarumo Poludo,Cecropia ,Plantae,Tracheophyta,Magnoliopsida,Urticales,Cecropiaceae,Cecropia (1),Cecropia (1),[],[],,,,,,,,,Cedro, Cedro Batata, Cedro Blanco, Cedro Branco, Cedro Colorado, Cedro Misionero, Cedro Rosdao, Cedro Vermelho,Cedar ,Plantae,Tracheophyta,Magnoliopsida,Sapindales,Meliaceae,Cedrela (1),Cedrela (1),[],[],,,Cedro Bayo, Cedro Coya, Cedro De Altura, Cedro De TucumÌÁn, Cedro Del Cerro, Cedro Peludo, Cedro Salteno, Cedro VÌ_rgen,Cedar ,Plantae,Tracheophyta,Magnoliopsida,Sapindales,Meliaceae,Cedrela (1),Cedrela (1),[],[],,,Moor macaque,Celebes macaque ,Animalia,Chordata,Mammalia,Primates,Cercopithecidae,Macaca (1),Macaca (1),[],[],,,,,,,,,,Centaurea alba,Centaurea ,Plantae,Tracheophyta,Magnoliopsida,Asterales,Compositae,Centaurea (1),Centaurea (1),[],[],,,,,,,,,,Centranthe ÌÛ Trois Nervures,Centranthe a trois nervures ,Plantae,Tracheophyta,Magnoliopsida,Dipsacales,Valerianaceae,Centranthus (1),Centranthus (1),[],[],,,,,,,,,,Eleutherodactylus viridicans,Cerro Munchique robber frog ,Animalia,Chordata,Amphibia,Anura,Strabomantidae,Pristimantis (1),Pristimantis (1),[],[],,,,,,,,,,Giant peccary, tagua,Chacoan peccary ,Animalia,Chordata,Mammalia,Cetartiodactyla,Tayassuidae,Catagonus (1),29.5 - 40 kg cm (2),The recent decline in the range and numbers of this species is due to a number of factors including hunting for meat habitat destruction disease and predation by larger felids like jaguars <i>(Panthera onca) </i>(4). All species of peccary in the Gran Chaco are hunted for their meat by local people even in the national parks. This species is particularly susceptible as they frequently dust bathe in groups in open spaces including on roads and often react to danger by standing their ground rather than fleeing. This behaviour enables hunters to eliminate whole groups in one encounter (4).,Hunting of all wildlife in Paraguay is officially prohibited and its exportation in Argentina is illegal. However such regulations seem to be ignored and un-enforced as hunting of the Chacoan peccary exists across its range. In 1990 a conservation action plan for this species was submitted to the Paraguayan Government and in 1991 a similar plan was given to relevant authorities in Bolivia and Argentina (4).,,,,,,,,,Chalcides polylepis occidentalis, Chalcides polylepis simonyi,Chalcides ,Animalia,Chordata,Reptilia,Squamata,Scincidae,Chalcides (1),Chalcides (1),Perhaps the most threatened skink species in the Canaries (5) <em>Chalcides simonyi</em> has a severely fragmented distribution due to the continuing loss of its habitat. Climate change is the most significant threat to this species as the increasing frequency of drought leading to more arid conditions is causing soil erosion and the degradation of its habitat. <strong>Feral</strong> and domestic cats also pose an additional threat to <em>Chalcides simonyi</em> while the largest population of this species was most likely destroyed by a volcanic eruption in the 18th century (1).,Although <em>Chalcides simonyi</em> has not been the target of any known conservation measures it is present in a number of protected areas (1) including Parque Natural Archip\xe9lago Chinijo (5).\xa0,,,,,,,,,Rhacophorus leprosus,Chapa bug-eyed frog ,Animalia,Chordata,Amphibia,Anura,Rhacophoridae,Theloderma (1),Theloderma (1),[],[],,,,,,,,,,Hyla charazani,Charazani tree frog ,Animalia,Chordata,Amphibia,Anura,Hylidae,Hyloscirtus (1),Hyloscirtus (1),[],[],,,,,,,,,,Karnataka bubble-nest frog, Seshachar‰Ûªs bush frog,Chari‰Ûªs bush frog ,Animalia,Chordata,Amphibia,Anura,Rhacophoridae,Raorchestes (1),Raorchestes (1),[],[],,,,,,,,,Black robin,Chatham Island black robin ,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Muscicapidae,Petroica (1),23.4 g (2),The introduction of mammalian predators such as rats and cats to the Chatham Islands following European settlement caused a rapid and deleterious decline in black robin numbers; the species became extinct on all but one island (6). By 1880 the species was restricted to around ten hectares of woody vegetation on a mammal-free rock-stack known as Little Mangere Island (5). Habitat loss on this island further threatened the species however and prompted an intensive conservation programme that began in the 1970s (5). Today a population of around 250 to 300 birds exists on two small islands: Mangere and Rangatira (or South East) Islands (6). Although all are descended from just one pair and are genetically identical there are no apparent deleterious effects resulting from their small gene pool (6). The possibility of accidental predator introduction remains a threat (2).,In the 1970s habitat loss on Little Mangere Island was so severe that the population of seven birds was moved to Mangere Island. By 1980 however the situation had reached crisis point with only five birds left in the world including only a single breeding pair (5). The New Zealand Wildlife Service began '<strong>cross-fostering</strong>' eggs and young from this remaining pair of robins (known as 'old blue' and 'old yellow') to another species in an effort to increase productivity (4) (5). This innovative approach was a resounding success; today between 250 and 300 birds are distributed on Mangere and Rangatira Islands and there are plans to introduce a population to the much larger Pitt Island once it has been cleared of pests (4) (6). This is a remarkable conservation success story and an example of what can be achieved (5).,,,,,,,,,,Chatham Island petrel, Chatham Islands petrel,Chatham petrel ,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Procellariiformes,Procellariidae,Pterodroma (1),200 g (2),The main threat to the Chatham petrel is competition for burrows with the broad-billed prion (<em>Pachyptila vittata</em>) which breeds earlier in the year leaving the Chatham petrel at a competitive disadvantage (7). The broad-billed prion is also known to attack eggs chicks and occasionally adults causing burrow evictions and high rates of mortality in young Chatham petrels (10). Broad-billed prion interference has also been proposed as a contributing factor in pair bond disruption (4).,Intensive research into the reasons for the decline of the Chatham petrel in the last two decades has led to several conservation actions. Breeding burrows have been artificially blockaded to prevent occupation by the competing broad-billed prion and any prions found invading petrel burrows during absences are culled. Installation of neoprene flaps to burrow entrances has helped reduce broad-billed prion interference during the incubation period and continual burrow monitoring and artificial nest site protection has significantly improved Chatham petrel breeding success (11).,,,,,,,,,Gomphurus consanguis,Cherokee clubtail ,Animalia,Arthropoda,Insecta,Odonata,Gomphidae,Gomphus (1),Gomphus (1),[],[],,,,,,,,,,Amazilia VentricastaÌ±a,Chestnut-bellied hummingbird ,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Apodiformes,Trochilidae,Amazilia (1),Average head-body length: 9 cm (2),Inhabiting a region with a large human population and intensive agriculture the chestnut-bellied hummingbird is suffering from extensive habitat loss. The status of this species has been somewhat unclear having been unrecorded over recent decades but it is now obvious that this rare species occupies a vulnerable position in a number of small fragmented populations (4). Deforestation has become progressively prevalent in the Colombian Andes with large tracts of forest replaced by coffee and sugarcane plantations pasture and crop cultivation (5) (7). Mining activity largely stimulated by a gold rush in 1996 has also had negative effects on the environment through habitat loss pollution and increased human immigration (4) (7).,Fortunately for the chestnut-bellied hummingbird it is the target of numerous conservation measures. Since 2002 the Colombian conservation organisations Fundaci\xf3n Colibri Organizacion Ambiental Ocotea and Fundacion Ecodiversidad have been directing community involvement projects in a reserve that supports the species. In 2008 they also began a banding and nest monitoring scheme and have undertaken awareness campaigns involving school children (8). Furthermore Fundaci\xf3n ProAves in collaboration with the Amercian Bird Conservancy have successfully created the Pauxi Pauxi reserve and the Cerulean Warbler Reserve and are working to protect the forests there (9). The chestnut-bellied hummingbird is also afforded sanctuary in the newly established Chicamocha National Park (4).,,,,,,,,,,ColibrÌ_ de Arica,Chilean woodstar ,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Apodiformes,Trochilidae,Eulidia (1),Length: 8 cm (2),The highly restricted range of the Chilean woodstar represents a threat to its survival; the species is confined to just two valleys in northern Chile which are already heavily cultivated (2). Viable habitat for this species of hummingbird is therefore scarce.,Further research into the natural ecology of this species is urgently required in order to understand the nature of resources needed to sustain the population. Exports of hummingbirds from Peru and Chile are controlled (2) and this species is listed on Appendix II of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) (3).,,,,,,,,,,ChimpanzÌ©,Chimpanzee ,Animalia,Chordata,Mammalia,Primates,Hominidae,Pan (1),Male weight: 34 - 70 kg (2)Female weight: 26 - 50 kg (2)Head-body length: 63.5 - 94 cm (2),Habitat loss from mining forestry and agriculture is one of the major threats to wildlife in equatorial Africa at present (8). Deforestation in west Africa is most severe and remaining pockets of undisturbed forest are home to highly fragmented populations of chimpanzees (8). The demand for <strong>bushmeat</strong> has recently exploded due in part to the growing human population more accessible forests and the increased availability of firearms (4); some conservationists believe this trade is currently the biggest threat to species' survival in the area. Exposure to human diseases presents a further threat to the chimpanzee (8).,Chimpanzees are protected by law throughout their range although this is often poorly enforced. The precise impact of the <strong>bushmeat</strong> trade is currently being investigated by the <strong>Bushmeat</strong> Working Group part of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) (9). The United Nations Environmental Program (UNEP) has recently recognised the urgent need to protect our closest relatives and has established a Great Ape Survival Project (GRASP) aimed at identifying the conservation initiatives required to secure the future of the apes and obtaining political support and funding to allow these to be achieved (10). The Jane Goodall Institute amongst other organisations is involving local people in chimp conservation in the form of sanctuaries and education programmes (5).,,,,,,,,,,Dwarf musk deer, Forest musk deer, South China forest musk deer,Chinese forest musk deer ,Animalia,Chordata,Mammalia,Cetartiodactyla,Moschidae,Moschus (1),Moschus (1),[],[],,,,,,,,Chinese coin turtle, Chinese three-keeled pond turtle, golden turtle, Japanese coin turtle, ReevesÌ¢åÛåª turtle,Chinese pond turtle ,Animalia,Chordata,Reptilia,Testudines,Geoemydidae,Mauremys (1),Carapace length: up to 23.6 cm (2),The Chinese pond turtle makes a popular pet and this has led to its over-collection in China where the species is also eaten. Elsewhere the turtle is considered to be under little risk (2).,Its listing on Appendix III of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) in China helps regulate the number of Chinese pond turtles that can be exported (3).

According to some estimates up to 15 million turtles are traded in the region each year with the majority ending up in China where the country\u2019s rapidly developing economy is fuelling a demand for expensive foods and traditional medicines made from turtles (7). The Chinese stripe-necked turtle is just one of the many species now considered at risk of extinction due to China\u2019s insatiable demand for turtle products (1).,In some areas Chinese stripe-necked turtle farms have been established predominantly to supply the pet trade (8). While this may benefit this Endangered species by lessening pressure on wild populations turtle farms can sometimes present a cover for illegal activities as turtles collected in the wild are passed through farms as offspring of the captive turtles (7). In China a capture permit is required before trapping wild Chinese stripe-necked turtles (9). However weak enforcement and low awareness pose significant obstacles to laws and other measures which seek to secure a future for the threatened freshwater turtles of Asia (7).,,,,,,,,Stephopaedes anotis,Chirinda toad ,Animalia,Chordata,Amphibia,Anura,Bufonidae,Mertensophryne (1),Mertensophryne (1),[],[],,,,,,,,,,ChocÌ_ vireo,Choco vireo ,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Vireonidae,Vireo (1),Vireo (1),[],[],,,,,,,,,,BeyÅÙehir nase,Chondrostoma ,Animalia,Chordata,Actinopterygii,Cypriniformes,Cyprinidae,Chondrostoma (1),Length: c. 15 - 25 cm (1) (2),Although the extent of threats to <em>Chondrostoma beysehirense</em> is not well known the species may be at risk from activities such as water extraction aquaculture and the construction of dams and weirs.

Human development and the invasion of exotic plant species have taken their toll on at least 80 percent of suitable habitat in the Coachella Valley and the remaining portion has been fragmented by roads and railways (3) (4).  Buildings and invasive plant species both stabilise the once free-moving sands preventing the continual replenishment of loose sand on which the lizard relies (3).,The Coachella Valley fringe-toed lizard is listed as threatened in the United States under the Endangered Species Act and as an endangered species by the State of California (3).  In addition to this legislation some of this lizard\u2019s habitat receives much-needed protection.  In 1985 the Coachella Valley National Wildlife Refuge was established to protect the fringe-toed lizard (3) followed by the creation of the Coachella Valley Preserve which encompasses an additional area of lizard habitat adjacent to the Wildlife Refuge (6).

The history of exploitation continues today and the collection of nuts has virtually stopped all natural regeneration of populations (4) with the exception of the introduced population on Silhouette. This palm has been lost from the wild from three Seychelles islands within its former range (4). Habitat loss is one of the major threats to the survival of remaining populations there have been numerous fires on the islands of Praslin and Curieuse and only immature trees remain over large parts of these islands (4).,The Seychelles is a World Heritage Site and a third of the area is now protected (3). The main populations of coco-de-mer palms are found within the Praslin and Curieuse National Parks (4) and the trade in nuts is controlled by the Coco-de-mer (Management) Decree of 1995 (4). Firebreaks also exist at key sites in an effort to prevent devastating fires from sweeping through populations (4). Cultivated palms are grown on a number of other islands and are widely present in botanic gardens; although the collection of seeds in order to recruit these populations may be a further threat to the remaining natural stands (4). Conservation priorities are the continued protection of populations enforcement of regulations and effective fire control (4).

Logging and grazing in swamps also alters the habitat to which the Cuban sparrow is adapted to (5). Subspecies <i>T.i.varonai</i> is threatened by habitat loss resulting from the expansion of the tourism industry and the cactus scrub habitat in Guantanamo is threatened by grazing felling of trees and the habitat conversion associated with increased urbanization (5).,Each of the subspecies has been recorded occurring within a protected area. For example in Zapata there is a UNESCO Biosphere Reserve a Ramsar site and also the Zapata Peninsula National Park. However the level of actual protection they offer the Cuban sparrow is variable.

On Hispaniola only two of the original <strong>endemic</strong> land mammal species now remain including Cuvier\u2019s hutia (3) (4) but the species is under serious threat from a combination of habitat loss hunting for food persecution as a crop pest and predation by introduced species such as dogs cats and mongooses. The species has been lost from much of its former range and its numbers have been drastically reduced (1) (2) (3) (5). The human population on Hispaniola is increasing and much of the forest has already been cleared for agriculture firewood harvesting charcoal production and urban and tourist development (2) (3) (8) (9). Some geographically distinct populations of Cuvier\u2019s hutia such as the proposed <strong>subspecies</strong> <em>P. a. hylaeum</em> may already be extinct (3) (4).,Cuvier\u2019s hutia occurs in a number of protected areas although habitat destruction may still be continuing within these (1). Very little is currently known about this unusual rodent (1) and further population surveys and molecular analyses are needed to better determine its status and that of any potential <strong>subspecies</strong> (3) (4).

The slow growth and reproductive rates typical of cycads may limit the ability of the <i>Dioon spinulosum</i> population to recover from any significant losses.,Cycads are of great conservation interest as they are an ancient group with considerable economic benefits to horticulture and the pharmaceutical industry as well as being important to soil health and fertility through nitrogen fixing (6). <i>Dioon spinulosum</i> receives some protection from international trade under its listing on Appendix II of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) (4) although increasing numbers of <i>Dioon</i> cycads have been used in gardening and landscaping within Mexico (2). There have been some efforts to propagate this species in captivity such as at the Royal Botanic Gardens at Kew (5). A cycad action plan published by the IUCN Cycad Specialist Group recommends a range of conservation measures for cycad species including setting up reserves and sustainable nurseries undertaking censuses regularly updating the <strong>taxonomy</strong> and status of the world\u2019s cycads and identifying the specific conservation needs and the actions required to preserve this unique group of plants (7).,,,,,,,,,Palma Del Sol (Sun Palm),Cycad ,Plantae,Tracheophyta,Cycadopsida,Cycadales,Zamiaceae,Dioon (1),Dioon (1),[],[],,,,,,,,,,common pitogo, queen sago,Cycad ,Plantae,Tracheophyta,Cycadopsida,Cycadales,Cycadaceae,Cycas (1),Trunk height: to 7 m (2)Trunk diameter: 12 ‰ÛÒ 27 cm (2),While in many areas <i>Cycas circinalis</i> remains abundant in others its habitat has been severely reduced and degraded (2). In addition this cycad is used in numerous ways by the local human population and some of this exploitation is having a negative impact on cycad numbers. <i>Cycas circinalis</i> is heavily harvested for its leaves with young leaves being used as food and medicine by indigenous and local communities and the mature leaves being sold in the floriculture industry (7). The biggest impact on <i>C. circinalis </i>populations however comes from the harvest of pith and male cone for the medicinal plant industry. While much of this harvest is illegal it is very difficult to patrol (7). It is not only the cycad itself that this harvesting may threaten; the harvesting of its seeds for human consumption appears to have little negative impact on <i>Cycas circinalis</i> populations but very heavy seed harvest could have an impact on the bats which reportedly feed on the seeds (7).,Significant populations of <i>Cycas circinalis</i> still exist in a number of national parks and forest reserves (2) which offers this species some protection. To reduce harvesting pressure on populations it has been suggested that people need to be encouraged to use substitutes. For example the floriculture industry could use leaves from cultivated palms that are faster growing. A substitute for the pith and male cone for the medicinal plant industry is not likely and thus in these cases populations need to be increased through cultivation (7).,,,,,,,,,Macrozamia pauli-guilielmi,Cycad ,Plantae,Tracheophyta,Cycadopsida,Cycadales,Zamiaceae,Macrozamia (1),Macrozamia (1),[],[],,,,,,,,,,Costilla De LeÌ_n,Cycad ,Plantae,Tracheophyta,Cycadopsida,Cycadales,Zamiaceae,Ceratozamia (1),Ceratozamia (1),[],[],,,,,,,,,,Palma Real (royal Palm).,Cycad ,Plantae,Tracheophyta,Cycadopsida,Cycadales,Zamiaceae,Dioon (1),Height: 1 m or more (2)Trunk diameter: 20 - 25 cm (2),Deforestation for logging and agriculture has occurred throughout the new world and this has had a dramatic effect on many cycad species especially those that grow in the understorey of forests. Although collecting of plants from the wild in the new world has been less severe\xa0than in parts of Africa several Mexican species including <em>D. caputoi</em> have been decimated by collectors\xa0(4). During the 1980s in particular local people report that large numbers of <em>D. caputoi</em> were extracted illegally. None of the four remaining populations of <em>D. caputoi</em> number more than 120 individuals and all are mostly comprised of adult plants due to poor natural recruitment of seedlings\xa0(5).,<em>Dioon caputoi </em>receives some protection from international trade under its listing on Appendix II of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) (3). Nonetheless a range of additional conservation measures are still urgently needed for this Critically Endangered species. This includes: efforts to halt the illegal extraction of plants and further deforestation within the remaining populations; the monitoring of population dynamics as part of a long-term management plan; and the reintroduction of artificially propagated plants\xa0(5).,,,,,,,,,,Milos viper,Cyclades blunt-nosed viper ,Animalia,Chordata,Reptilia,Squamata,Viperidae,Macrovipera (1),Average length: 60 ‰ÛÒ 70 cm (2),The Cyclades blunt-nosed viper has become seriously threatened as a result of habitat destruction road mortality and removal by man. Two big quarries are in continuous operation on western Milos which have considerably increased in size over the last 15 years and destroyed large areas of pristine habitat. Additionally there are plans for more quarries on western Milos which pose an extremely significant threat to this critically endangered species. Fires also cause habitat destruction destroying the large bushes and trees in which the main prey birds are found. During the period of \u2018reforestation\u2019 after a fire goat and sheep grazing can be highly destructive preventing trees and large bushes from growing. At present tourism does not threaten the snake\u2019s habitat but a new airport planned for Milos may increase tourism to a level that is damaging to viper habitats. The other islands appear to provide fairly pristine untouched habitat and the populations there are healthy although a little smaller than on Milos (2).,The Regional Development Agency of Cyclades is implementing a project called \u2018Protection and Promotion of the Habitats and Species of the Milos Island Natura 2000 Area\u2019 focussing on three main actions. Firstly monitoring of the region\u2019s habitats and species including this viper are to be ongoing. Secondly efforts will be made to raise public awareness of the threats that face Milos\u2019 flora and fauna including promoting Milos Island as a destination of great ecological and ecotourism value (6). Not only could the dissemination of information help reduce intentional killing of the snake but it could also help instil a sense of pride in the local fauna and encourage local inhabitants to support the police in their struggle against snake hunters (2). Finally roads will be made safer for crossing vipers through the construction of barriers and underground passages. The Standing Committee of the Bern Convention has also recommended that there is stronger and stricter police control of illegal trade in the species (6). Further conservation actions advocated include the establishment of protected areas with optimal habitats and connective corridors and the eradication of feral cats if studies verify the threat they pose to young snakes (2). A captive breeding programme has been started in collaboration with Jersey Zoo and a similar programme has been proposed for Budapest Zoo and Botanical Gardens (3) which will provide an important buffer against extinction and offer potential for future reintroductions into the wild.,,,,,,,,,,Acioa hirsuta,Dactyladenia ,Plantae,Tracheophyta,Magnoliopsida,Rosales,Chrysobalanaceae,Dactyladenia (1),Dactyladenia (1),[],[],,,,,,,,,,Dalbergia bernieri,Dalbergia ,Plantae,Tracheophyta,Magnoliopsida,Fabales,Leguminosae,Dalbergia (1),Dalbergia (1),[],[],,,,,,,,,,Microrasbora erythromicron,Danio ,Animalia,Chordata,Actinopterygii,Cypreiniformes,Cyprinidae,Danio (1),Danio (1),[],[],,,,,,,,,,Huchen,Danube salmon ,Animalia,Chordata,Actinopterygii,Salmoniformes,Salmonidae,Hucho (1),up to 53 kg (2),Once widespread the Danube salmon is now amongst the most endangered fish species in Europe (3) (8). Numbers have been massively depleted due to overexploitation industrial and agricultural pollution deforestation (causing increased water temperatures) water redirection and badly designed or non-existent fish ladders in dams and reservoirs (2) (6). Barriers and dams are major obstacles for spawning fish and prevent genetic exchange between sub-populations (8). In addition the fish\u2019s popularity with anglers as a sports fish has probably also contributed to the species\u2019 decline (2). As a result of these combined threats the Danube salmon is now common in only around 33% of its former range rare in 28 % and has disappeared completely from 39 % (4).,Conservation efforts to date have involved the establishment of reserves restocking of populations and introductions into rivers not previously inhabited by the species legal restrictions on fishing times and quotas and even a total ban on fishing the Danube salmon in most European countries (4) (6). Unfortunately none of the measures have had long-term success partly due to the continuing pollution of rivers (4) (6). It has therefore been advocated that total protection should be given to the Danube salmon\u2019s habitat with particular focus on the halting of pollution and that more ecologically sound fishery management protocols be implemented (6).,,,,,,,,,,Red lauan,Dark red meranti ,Plantae,Tracheophyta,Magnoliopsida,Theales,Dipterocarpaceae,Shorea (1),Shorea (1),[],[],,,,,,,,,,Eleutherodactylus devillei,DeVille's robber frog ,Animalia,Chordata,Amphibia,Anura,Strabomantidae,Pristimantis (1),Pristimantis (1),[],[],,,,,,,,,,Deignan‰Ûªs tree skink, Deignan's lankaskink,Deignan tree skink ,Animalia,Chordata,Reptilia,Squamata,Scincidae,Lankascincus (1),Snout-vent length: 4 - 5.8 cm (2),The Deignan tree skink is considered to be under threat due to its very restricted distribution and the specific and highly fragmented nature of its habitat. At present the largest threats to this species\u2019 habitat are agricultural practices logging and firewood collection which destroy and disrupt the rainforest environment on which this skink relies (1).,There is no specific action being taken to preserve the Deignan tree skink nor are there any precise figures available regarding its current population. For this reason further studies are needed into the Deignan tree skink\u2019s numbers (1).,,,,,,,,,Denison‰Ûªs barb, Miss Kerala, red line torpedo barb, red-lined torpedo fish,Denison barb ,Animalia,Chordata,Actinopterygii,Cypriniformes,Cyprinidae,Puntius (1),Maximum length: 15 cm (2),One of India\u2019s most celebrated ornamental fishes the Denison barb has suffered huge declines as a result of its popularity. In the absence of catch limits the single most significant threat to this species is unsustainable collection for the pet trade. It has declined at an alarming rate of around 70 percent since 2004 and is now reduced to highly fragmented relict populations (1) (3) (4) (8).,A conservation priority for the recovery of the Denison barb is to reduce the number of fish caught in fisheries as at present this is likely unsustainable. The Government of Kerala has introduced regulations for catch limits and restrictions on the use of fishing gear while plans have been developed for designated no-take zones and specific Denison barb sanctuaries. The listing of the species on India\u2019s National Wildlife Protection Act should also ensure that trade is carefully regulated (7).,,,,,,,Asian wild dog,Dhole ,Animalia,Chordata,Mammalia,Carnivora,Canidae,Cuon (1),Length: 90 cm (2)Shoulder height: 50 cm (2)Tail length: 40 - 45 cm (2)Male weight: 15 - 20 kg (2)Female weight: 10 - 13 kg (2),Dhole numbers have been reduced as their habitat is being destroyed throughout much of the Asian continent; the human population explosion has led to the clearance of vast tracts of forest for timber and to make way for agriculture and development (5). Historically hunters viewed dholes as competition and thus persecuted them; bounties were also offered for their pelts (4). Today habitat loss and the elimination of prey species pose the greatest threats to the survival of the dhole (4). Diseases such as distemper and rabies possibly spread by domestic dogs are important threats to the Indian <strong>subspecies</strong> <i>C. a. primaevus</i> (2).,Dholes are protected throughout most of their range in India they are protected under Schedule I of the Wildlife Act of 1972 and hunting has also been prohibited in Russia since 1971 (2). In India and Nepal dholes are protected within many tiger reserves and this has helped to keep their stronghold in southern India (4). More data is urgently needed on dhole distribution and numbers and the Dhole Conservation Programme is working to achieve this and to develop a Dhole Action Plan to safeguard the future of this remarkable canid (5).,,,,,,,,,,PropithÌ¬que ÌÛ DiadÌ¬me,Diademed sifaka ,Animalia,Chordata,Mammalia,Primates,Indriidae,Propithecus (1),4.75 ‰ÛÒ 8.5 kg (2),Like many Malagasy primates the diademed sifaka is primarily threatened by the destruction of its rainforest habitat. <strong>Primary forests</strong> are being cleared to make way for agriculture the extraction of timber and charcoal production (1) (2). Worryingly it appears that this species may be sensitive to even slight disturbances as it has vanished from areas which have suffered only a little degradation (2). This species is also hunted for food an activity which is having a serious detrimental impact even on populations that lie within supposedly protected areas (1).,The diademed sifaka occurs in a number of national parks and reserves for example Mantadia and Zahamena National Parks but unfortunately this does not always offer the species protection from the threat of hunting (1). A conservation action plan for lemurs compiled in 1992 stated that better protection of such areas is a necessary conservation action for this species (8). The plan also suggested that a captive breeding programme should be developed (8); for many years there has only been one male diademed sifaka held in captivity in Duke Lemur Centre in North Carolina USA (9).,,,,,,,,,,freckled marsupial mouse, Southern dibbler, speckled marsupial mouse,Dibbler ,Animalia,Chordata,Mammalia,Dasyuromorphia,Dasyuridae,Parantechinus (1),40-100 g (2),This species has been lost from 90% of its former range in Australia (4). It is not known why this marsupial is so rare although surveys suggest various factors. Land clearing and habitat fragmentation are thought to be significant causes of its decline. In addition the frequent burning of heathland and litter may reduce the availability of invertebrates in the area. Predation by introduced mammals such as foxes and cats are also considered a threat to this species (4).,In 1992 a recovery plan for this species was developed by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources (IUCN) addressing the threats facing this species (4). Predation by foxes and cats has now been brought under control by The Department of Conservation and Land Management (CALM) and in the last decade dibbler numbers have started to increase (5). Perth Zoo has been working with CALM to establish a captive breeding stock of over 100 individuals of this species (6). They have also translocated a group of dibblers to Escape Island; a predator free island which has suitable habitat for this marsupial. Here radio tracking devices and trapping practices will be used to monitor the populations (5). Considering that the dibbler was on the brink of extinction this recovery plan has been a great success. It is however essential to maintain these conservation efforts as the dibbler is still regarded as a severely endangered animal (1).,,,,,,,,Diospyros cunalon,Diospyros ,Plantae,Tracheophyta,Magnoliopsida,Ebenales,Ebenaceae,Diospyros (1),Diospyros (1),[],[],,,,,,,,,,Discocactus lindaianus,Discocactus ,Plantae,Tracheophyta,Magnoliopsida,Caryophyllales,Cactaceae,Discocactus (1),Discocactus (1),[],[],,,,,,,,,,TrÌ©bol de Risco, TrÌ©bol de Risco Rosado,Dorycnium ,PlantaeåÊåÊåÊåÊ,Tracheophyta,Magnoliopsida,Fabales,Leguminosae,Dorycnium (1),Dorycnium (1),[],[],,,,,,,,,Chalcides polylepis,Doumergue's skink ,Animalia,Chordata,Reptilia,Squamata,Scincidae,Chalcides (1),Length: up to 9.1 cm (2),Relatively little is known about the threats to Doumergue's skink. It is believed to be uncommon within its narrow and severely fragmented range and is likely to be under threat from the development of coastal areas for tourism and military purposes. Its habitat may also be declining in quality for example through the removal of ground cover as driftwood is collected for fuel. The species is not known to exist in modified habitats (1).,Doumergue\u2019s skink occurs in the Chafarine Hunting Reserve in the Chafarinas islands Spain as well as in the Sebkha Bou Areg and Embouchure Moulouya protected areas in Morocco (1). However no specific conservation measures are known to be in place for this small reptile and further research into its ecology life history and the threats it faces are likely to be needed if the species is to be given effective protection.,,,,,,,,,,Bois De Chandelle,Dracaena ,Plantae,Tracheophyta,Liliopsida,Liliales,Dracaenaceae,Dracaena (1),Dracaena (1),[],[],,,,,,,,,,Dril,Drill ,Animalia,Chordata,Mammalia,Primates,Cercopithecidae,Mandrillus (1),Head-body length: 70 cm (5)Male weight: 20 kg (5)Female weight: 12.5 kg (5),The mature rainforest in this equatorial region of Africa has been destroyed at an alarming rate causing many species to become endangered. The drill is under additional pressure from hunting as the sweet 'bushmeat' of this species is an important income for many people in the region (3). Large groups of noisy drills either on the ground or within range amongst the trees make an easy target for hunters and cleared forests are ever more accessible (3).,In 1995 the drill was identified as an important priority for conservation due to its taxonomic uniqueness; it has only one close relative (3). It is listed on Appendix I of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) thus prohibiting international trade (2). In the wild only a single population is known to occur within a protected area the Korup Reserve in Cameroon (7). Fauna and Flora International (FFI) are involved in the Drill Rehabilitation and Breeding Centre Nigeria which aims to rehabilitate young orphaned drills and to raise awareness of the plight of this species in the local area (7). In addition there are over 40 drills in captivity around the world some of which have been successfully bred (7). This may provide a last redoubt against the extinction of this magnificent species.,,,,,,,,,,Philautus viridis, Pseudophilautus viridis,Dull green shrub frog ,Animalia,Chordata,Amphibia,Anura,Rhacophoridae,Raorchestes (1),Raorchestes (1),[],[],,,,,,,,,dumb shark, Harrison's deepsea dogfish, Harrison's dogfish, longnose gulper shark,Dumb gulper shark ,Animalia,Chordata,Chondrichthyes,Squaliformes,Centrophoridae,Centrophorus (1),Total length: up to 111 cm (2),The dumb gulper shark is subject to trawl fishing and in New South Wales it is also harvested by droplining (in which long fishing lines with a series of hooks are set vertically down into the water). Dramatic population declines have occurred in some areas with declines of over 99 percent recorded between 1976 to 1977 and 1996 to 1997 and the dumb gulper shark may now only be present in reasonable numbers in areas that cannot be trawled. <em>Centrophorus</em> species are harvested for meat and liver oil but the low reproductive rate late age of maturity and long lifespan typical of these deep-water sharks means that species such as the dumb gulper shark are unable to recover quickly after depletion (1).,In 2003 management changes to the South East Trawl Fishery (SETF) by the Australian Fisheries Management Authority brought in new limits to the permissible catch of dumb gulper sharks. In addition the livers of <em>Centrophorus</em> species were not allowed to be retained unless the carcasses from which they were obtained were also landed. In Australia recommendations have also been made to list the dumb gulper shark as an Endangered species on the Environmental Protection and Biodiversity Conservation (EPBC) Act a listing that would require that a Recovery Plan be put in place for this little-known deepwater shark (1).,,,,,,,Dusky perch,Dusky grouper ,Animalia,Chordata,Actinopterygii,Perciformes,Serranidae,Epinephelus (1),up to 60 kg (2),As a popular food fish the primary threat to the dusky grouper is over exploitation from commercial fisheries across its range (1) although adult fish are also caught as trophies particularly by spearfishing (9). Over-fishing and spearfishing have caused a dramatic decline in numbers over the last few decades leaving dusky grouper populations seriously depleted mainly in the north-western Mediterranean (5). The slow growth rate late onset of maturity and complex reproductive biology of this species compound these threats by making it harder for it to withstand or recover from high fishing pressure (1). The fact that it also forms <strong>spawning</strong> aggregations combined with its large size makes this fish particularly easy to catch and therefore vulnerable to over-harvesting (1). Indeed despite insufficient data from many range countries alarming declines have been recorded in Europe and the Mediterranean (mainly north-western) and there are also reports that <strong>spawning</strong> aggregations are being specifically targeted in Brazil (1).,Spearfishing of this species has been banned since 1993 in France (Mediterranean coast only) with evidence of small recoveries in this area (1). A number of Marine Protected Areas have also been established where the habitat of the fish is protected or where fishing is prohibited (1) (9). In South Africa the dusky grouper is part of a \u2018restricted group\u2019 of species governed by a bag limit of five fish a day (1). Additionally the dusky grouper was recently added to the endangered <strong>teleost</strong> list in Annex 3 to the Berne Convention (1996) under which management measures must be planned and aquaculture maintaining and breeding techniques developed in order to increase and repopulate endangered stocks (5). Unfortunately this fish does not adapt well to living and reproducing in aquariums (2) and research into successful husbandry techniques is therefore ongoing (5).,,,,,,,,,,Botia sidthimunki,Dwarf loach ,Animalia,Chordata,Actinopterygii,Cypriniformes,Cobitidae,Yasuhikotakia (1),Yasuhikotakia (1),[],[],,,,,,,,,,Queensland sawfish,Dwarf sawfish ,Animalia,Chordata,Chondrichthyes,Rajiformes,Pristidae,Pristis (1),Pristis (1),[],[],,,,,,,,,,Melocactus actinacanthus,Dwarf turk's cap cactus ,Plantae,Tracheophyta,Magnoliopsida,Caryophyllales,Cactaceae,Melocactus (1),Melocactus (1),[],[],,,,,,,,,,Haplophloga poivreana, Neophloga poivreana,Dypsis ,Plantae,Tracheophyta,Liliopsida,Arecales,Palmae,Dypsis (1),Dypsis (1),[],[],,,,,,,,,Neophloga integra,Dypsis ,Plantae,Tracheophyta,Liliopsida,Arecales,Palmae,Dypsis (1),Dypsis (1),[],[],,,,,,,,,,Dypsis anovensis,Dypsis ,Plantae,Tracheophyta,Liliopsida,Arecales,Palmae,Dypsis (1),Dypsis (1),[],[],,,,,,,,,,Clarence River cod,Eastern freshwater cod ,Animalia,Chordata,Actinopterygii,Perciformes,Percichthyidae,Maccullochella (1),Maccullochella (1),[],[],,,,,,,,,,Pininana,Echium ,PlantaeåÊ,Tracheophyta,Magnoliopsida,LamialesåÊ,Boraginaceae,Echium (1),Echium (1),[],[],,,,,,,,,,Eleutherodactylus glandulosus,Ecuador robber frog ,Animalia,Chordata,Amphibia,Anura,Strabomantidae,Pristimantis (1),Pristimantis (1),[],[],,,,,,,,,,Edmund,Edmund's snaketail ,Animalia,Arthropoda,Insecta,Odonata,Gomphidae,Ophiogomphus (1),Length: 4.5 - 4.8 cm (2),Edmund\u2019s snaketail is threatened by the impounding and channelling of water to develop dams and reservoirs for hydroelectric schemes irrigation and water supplies. Siltation drainage and pollution also pose further threats to this species as they destroy freshwater habitats by lowering the water table sometimes turning permanent waterbodies into temporary water sources (1) (3) (8).,The Conasauga River runs through fairly rugged inaccessible country in national forests in Tennessee and Georgia which affords some level of protection to Edmund\u2019s snaketail in these areas.

In Africa declines have been caused by the loss of wild <strong>ungulate</strong> populations and in some areas overgrazing by livestock (5).  In Europe the Egyptian vulture has been suffering severe long-term declines; the result of disturbance lead poisoning from gun shot direct poisoning and electrocution by powerlines as well as regulations introduced within the European Union to control the disposal of animal carcasses which have greatly reduced food availability for this scavenger.  In addition Avian pox has been cited as the cause of Egyptian vulture deaths in Bulgaria (5).  In India diclofenac an anti-inflammatory drug often used for livestock is likely to be the source of recent and extremely rapid declines in Egyptian vulture populations (5) (7).  This drug which is also responsible for devastating declines in other vulture species poisons vultures when they feed on the flesh of treated livestock (8).,Throughout its range the Egyptian vulture occurs in a number of protected areas as well as being the subject of monitoring supplementary feeding programmes and campaigns against the illegal use of poisons (5).  In 2006 manufacture of the veterinary form of the drug diclofenac was banned by the Indian Nepali and Pakistani governments (9) (10).  While this was a remarkable step forward in vulture conservation the drug remains widely available and the human form of the drug is sometimes being used to treat livestock instead (9).    Many more measures may be necessary if the long-term survival of the Egyptian vulture is to be assured.  BirdLife International recommends relaxing European Union regulations with regards to the disposal of animal carcasses lobbying for the ban of diclofenac throughout the species range and protecting nest sites as just some of the measures which would benefit the Egyptian vulture (5).,,,,,,,,,,Cotorra de El Oro, Perico de El Oro,El Oro parakeet ,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Psittaciformes,Psittacidae,Pyrrhura (1),Length: 22 cm (2),Deforestation associated with logging and clearance of trees for agriculture is a huge threat to the survival of the El Oro Parakeet. Although high altitude <strong>cloud forest</strong> is being deforested at a much slower rate this species is largely restricted to the more accessible lower altitude forest (2) (7). As habitat becomes more and more fragmented so the sub-populations are becoming more and more isolated and vulnerable. In 2006 the total population of El Oro parakeets was estimated to be less than 1000 birds (2).,In the past decade around 1500 hectares of forest has been acquired by the Jocotoco Foundation at Buenaventura the locality in which the El Oro parakeet was first discovered (2) (7) (8). Now known as the Buenaventura Reserve it is one of the richest ornithological regions of Ecuador and the only well protected site in which the El Oro parakeet occurs (7) (8). Approximately 80 El Oro parakeets are year-round occupants of the reserve but at certain times of the year the total number rises to around 120 (7) (9). The long-term aim is to expand the reserve to 5000 hectares and implement an environmental awareness campaign that will encourage and engage local people in conservation (2) (7) (8).,,,,,,,,,Brow-antlered deer, thamin,Eld‰Ûªs deer ,Animalia,Chordata,Mammalia,Cetartiodactyla,Cervidae,Rucervus (1),up to 150 kg (2),Eld\u2019s deer are widely hunted as food and for their antlers (6). In particular Eld\u2019s deer are thought to have been hunted to feed the armies during many Asian wars (10). They are a prized game animal because of their impressive antlers and hides which are sold in the local markets (6). Habitat destruction due to expanding agriculture has also had a major impact on this rare species. In Manipur the Manipur brow-antlered deer (<i>R. e. eldii</i>) population has declined primarily due to wetland reclamation for grazing cultivation and fish farming (6). Very little suitable habitat is protected; only one percent of the protected forests in Southeast Asia are suitable for Eld\u2019s deer (11). Even within protected areas these threats continue. The Chatthin Wildlife Sanctuary Myanmar is one of the last strongholds of the species yet the <strong>dipterocarp</strong> forest within it continues to be degraded under great pressure from local communities for cropland and timber (7). Sadly there is often a lack of funding and political will for protection (12). Due to their highly fragmented distribution this species is also at risk from <strong>inbreeding</strong> and loss of genetic variation (12).,Eld\u2019s deer occur in a number of protected areas throughout its range. The entire Manipur brow-antlered deer (<i>R. e. eldii</i>) population now resides within Keibul Lamjao National Park Manipur (1) created in 1977 specifically to protect this <strong>subspecies</strong> (6). Additionally local projects have helped raise public awareness and support for conserving the deer (6). Hainan Datian Nature Reserve on Hainan Island China was established in 1976 specifically to help the Thailand brow-antlered deer (<i>R. e. siamensis</i>) <strong>subspecies</strong> recover with the population now growing an average of 15 percent annually (8). This population has become so large in fact that large numbers have been translocated to other parts of the island (8). Kyatthin and Shwesettaw Wildlife Sanctuaries were established in Myanmar to protect the Burmese brow-antlered deer (<i>R. e. thamin</i>) <strong>subspecies</strong> and a community education project was initiated in 1995 to raise local awareness about the plight of the deer and the protected status of the Kyatthin Wildlife Sanctuary (6). Captive populations exist around the world but <strong>inbreeding</strong> is common and cooperative <strong>cross-breeding</strong> is required if captive populations are to be genetically varied enough for any future reintroduction programmes into the wild (12).,,,,,,,,,Sanghir sunbird,Elegant sunbird ,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Nectariniidae,Aethopyga (1),Length: 12 cm (2),When the tiny island of Sangihe was first colonised in the 17<sup>th </sup>century its forests were plundered for their natural resources of fruit spices and fibres. When these were gone the forests were replaced with plantations of bananas coconuts rubber and tea (7). After centuries of agriculture Sangihe has now been almost entirely stripped of forest and only tiny patches remain (6) (8). Naturally this has had a great impact on the island\u2019s wildlife including the elegant sunbird.,Action Sampiri a UK-based conservation group has been working to promote wildlife conservation on Sangihe since 1995 by conducting fieldwork running education and awareness programmes and developing ideas for future land-use that may be mutually beneficial to the local people and wildlife (2). The <strong>primary forest</strong> fragment at Mount Sahendaruman is nominally protected although action is limited (2) and forest in the Kentuhang valley also receives some protection as part of a <strong>watershed</strong> for a hydroelectric scheme (2). Improved effective protection of the forest at Mount Sahendaruman has been recommended (2) a measure that would not only help the elegant sunbird but also the other highly threatened species clinging to existence in this tiny patch of forest.\xa0,,,,,,,,,,pineapple tortoise, red-nosed tortoise, yellow tortoise, yellow-headed tortoise,Elongated tortoise ,Animalia,Chordata,Reptilia,Testudines,Testudinidae,Indotestudo (1),3.5 kg (2),The elongated tortoise is under extreme pressure across most of its range largely\xa0due to it being widely harvested and sold on the Asian food markets (2). It is the most common tortoise to be shipped to the Chinese food markets from Vietnam (2); approximately 100000 were shipped from Ho Chi Minh City in 1993 (5).,This species has been placed on Appendix II of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) which regulates its legal international trade (2).,,,,,,,Taosze spiny toad,Emei moustache toad ,Animalia,Chordata,Amphibia,Anura,Megophryidae,Vibrissaphora (1),Vibrissaphora (1),[],[],,,,,,,,,,Panicaut Nain Vivipare,Eryngium ,Plantae,Tracheophyta,Magnoliopsida,Apiales,Umbelliferae,Eryngium (1),Eryngium (1),[],[],,,,,,,,,,ColibrÌ_ de Esmeraldas, Estrellita EsmeraldeÌ±a,Esmeraldas woodstar ,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Apodiformes,Trochilidae,Chaetocercus (1),Chaetocercus (1),[],[],,,,,,,,,Stresemann‰Ûªs bushcrow,Ethiopian bush-crow ,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Corvidae,Zavattariornis (1),Length: 30 cm (2)Wingspan: 13 ‰ÛÒ 15 cm (3),The Ethiopian bush-crow appears to have very specific habitat requirements particularly with regard to the density of <i>Acacia</i> bushes. The vegetation in the Yavello Wildlife Sanctuary has been shown to have become much denser between 1986 and 2002 as a result of the enforcement of fire suppression and this is thought to be the cause of the decline in Ethiopian bush-crows. Partial clearance of scrub for cattle grazing space appears to have benefited the crow but intensive clearing of scrub for firewood and grazing is said to be having a negative impact elsewhere. The spread of cultivated land is also reducing suitable habitat (2).,A detailed study of the Ethiopian bush-crow\u2019s ecology and habitat requirements is currently underway and it is hoped that this might shed light on the effect of clearing <i>Acacia</i>. Yavello Sanctuary was created in order to protect this species and the white-tailed swallow (<i>Hirundo megaensis</i>) but there is no active management and the sanctuary has been deemed a failure. Responsibility for the area has now been transferred to the regional government and it is hoped that in collaboration with the local communities the sanctuary will become highly valuable and act as a stronghold for both of these important species (2).,,,,,,,,,,Abyssinian wolf, Simien fox, Simien jackal,Ethiopian wolf ,Animalia,Chordata,Mammalia,Carnivora,Canidae,Canis (1),11 - 20 kg (2),The Ethiopian wolf has been reduced to a handful of mountain ranges due to pressures on the habitat particularly conversion to agriculture (2). As populations have become increasingly isolated by the fragmentation of their habitat the likelihood of local extinctions has increased. Rabies and distemper transmitted from domestic dogs to the wolves and <strong>hybridisation</strong> resulting from breeding with domestic dogs further threatens the survival of this species (4) (6).,Determined conservation efforts are needed in order to ensure the long-term survival of the remaining Ethiopian wolf populations. The Ethiopian Wolf Conservation Programme (EWCP) is a joint long-term project between the Wildlife Conservation Research Unit at Oxford University the Born Free Foundation and the Ethiopian Wildlife Conservation Organisation under the aegis of the IUCN Canid Specialist Group (4). The EWCP carries out vital conservation measures in the field working closely with local people and undertakes population monitoring and other needed research. Some of the activities undertaken so far in the Bale Mountains include assistance with park management in Bale vaccination and sterilisation of local dogs education programmes and tourism development (4) and the EWCP team has now expanded its activities to all wolf populations in the north of the country (7).,,,,,,,,Uvillo,Eugenia ,Plantae,Tracheophyta,Magnoliopsida,Myrtales,Myrtaceae,Eugenia (1),Eugenia (1),[],[],,,,,,,,,,Testudo euphratica, Trionyx euphraticus,Euphrates softshell turtle ,Animalia,Chordata,Reptilia,Testudines,Trionychidae,Rafetus (1),Length: up to 68 cm (2),Habitat destruction caused by damming projects along the Tigris and Euphrates rivers is a major threat to the Euphrates softshell turtle (2) (6) (8).,Proposed conservation measures include further studies into the biology and habitats of the Euphrates softshell turtle as well as into the relationship between this species and local communities (5).,,,,,,,,,Evrotas dace,European dace ,Animalia,Chordata,Actinopterygii,Cypriniformes,Cyprinidae,Squalius (1),Maximum length: 25 cm (2),Restricted to just a single river the European dace is primarily threatened by the loss of its habitat. Although the Evrotas River naturally dries up during periods of drought water extraction for agriculture has exacerbated this resulting in fish being stranded in stagnant pools of water with low oxygen concentration and high temperatures (1) (6). This was most severe in 2007 when a prolonged drought resulted in around 80 percent of the main river course drying up (6). As the European dace inhabits fast flowing cold waters mass fish mortality has been observed in areas where its habitat has been degraded in such a way (5). Fish communities within the Evrotas River have also suffered from pollution with lowland parts of the river often near urban areas being the most severely effected (1) (6).,The Evrotas River home to the European dace is a unique biodiversity hotspot within Greece. Its waters support many <strong>endemic</strong> species of plants and fish and consequently protecting this fragile environment is a key conservation priority (6). The importance of this river and a plan for its conservation is outlined in the EU Water Framework Directive. This requires habitat monitoring and management programmes to be implemented whilst tackling the threats to the river (6) (7). Furthermore establishing protected areas and developing sustainable water management plans will be crucial in preserving the European dace for the future (1) (2).,,,,,,,,,,great Truk white-eye, large Truk white-eye, teardrop white-eye, Truk white-eye,Faichuk white-eye ,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Zosteropidae,Rukia (1),Rukia (1),[],[],,,,,,,rock-cress,Falklands rock cress ,Plantae,Tracheophyta,Magnoliopsida,Capparales,Cruciferae,Phlebolobium (1),Height: 45 - 60 cm (2),The biggest threat to the Falklands rock cress is grazing. In the past overgrazing by sheep and other livestock has caused the Falklands rock cress to undergo a major decline\xa0and it now only exists in small localised patches. This limited distribution places it under additional threat from continued grazing agriculture human disturbance chance natural events genetic erosion and invasive species (1) (6) (7) (8).\xa0\xa0\xa0,Protected by law the Falklands rock cress is listed in the Conservation of Wildlife and Nature Ordinance by the Falkland Islands Government (4). Conservation programmes are currently focusing on protecting the Falkland Islands\u2019 plant species and mitigating the threats to their survival while Falklands Conservation is also working in collaboration with the Royal Botanic Gardens Kew on identifying important plant areas throughout the islands (8). The Falklands Islands Plant Conservation Project with assistance from Falklands Conservation is developing a strategy for the long-term conservation of the islands\u2019 threatened flora with plans for sustainable land management and protection. Public education projects are also aiming to tackle human disturbances to natural environments (7).,,,,,,,,,,Petagnia saniculifolia,Falsa sanicola ,Plantae,Tracheophyta,Magnoliopsida,Apiales,Umbelliferae,Petagnaea (1),Petagnaea (1),[],[],,,,,,,,,,Faux Gavial Malais,False gharial ,Animalia,Chordata,Reptilia,Crocodylia,Crocodylidae,Tomistoma (1),Male length: at least 5 m (2),Habitat destruction caused by the construction of dams channelling and deforestation amongst others has been the main cause of the decline of this species and continues to be its main threat to this day (3). Intensive hunting in some areas especially Sumatra in the mid 20th Century also contributed greatly to the decline in population numbers (3). Further threats come from fishing practices with false gharials either becoming caught in nets poisoned by toxins used to kill fish or else loosing their food source to local fishermen (2).,International trade in the false gharial is prevented by its listing on Appendix I of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) (1) and many of the known populations occur within protected areas (3). Recent population estimates of the false gharial are under 2500 mature adults but data on distribution is still insufficient (2). Before a successful conservation management plan can be implemented more information needs to be collected on the current status of this species in Malaysia and Indonesia. Further research into behaviour and ecology must be carried out in order to identify priority habitats and population needs (3). A Tomistoma Task Force has recently been set up under the umbrella of the IUCN-SSC Crocodile Specialist Group (5).,,,,,,,,,,Serrated day gecko,Fan-tailed day gecko ,Animalia,Chordata,Reptilia,Squamata,Gekkonidae,Phelsuma (1),Phelsuma (1),[],[],,,,,,,,,,Malamasafoy,Fengoko ,Plantae,Tracheophyta,Magnoliopsida,Fabales,Fabaceae,Delonix (1),Delonix (1),[],[],,,,,,,,,,Coajinguba,Ficus ,Plantae,Tracheophyta,Magnoliopsida,Urticales,Moraceae,Ficus (1),Ficus (1),[],[],,,,,,,,,,Figueira-baiana,Ficus ,Plantae,Tracheophyta,Magnoliopsida,Urticales,Moraceae,Ficus (1),Ficus (1),[],[],,,,,,,,,,Figueira-de-aripuana,Ficus ,Plantae,Tracheophyta,Magnoliopsida,Urticales,Moraceae,Ficus (1),Ficus (1),[],[],,,,,,,,,,Renaquinho,Fig ,Plantae,Tracheophyta,Magnoliopsida,Urticales,Moraceae,Ficus (1),Ficus (1),[],[],,,,,,,,,,South Pacific banded iguana,Fiji banded iguana ,Animalia,Chordata,Reptilia,Squamata,Iguanidae,Brachylophus (1),Total length: up to 80 cm (2),The Fiji banded iguana is considered seriously endangered due to habitat destruction and predation by mongooses and house cats introduced to the islands which feed on the iguanas and their eggs (5).,The Fiji banded iguana now has full protection under both Fiji and international laws (5). There have also been very successful captive breeding programmes of this species with the Fear-No-More Zoo in Fiji having successfully bred the species for the last fifteen years (9) and the San Diego Zoo in the U.S. having produced over 100 offspring since 1965 (10).,,,,,,,,,,Fiji land frog, Fijian ground frog, Viti wrinkled ground frog,Fiji ground frog ,Animalia,Chordata,Amphibia,Anura,Ranidae,Platymantis (1),Platymantis (1),[],[],,,,,,,,Common rorqual, Finback, Fin-backed whale, Finner, Herring Whale, Razorback,Fin whale ,Animalia,Chordata,Mammalia,Cetartiodactyla,Balaenopteridae,Balaenoptera (1),45,360 - 63,500 kg (4),The major threat to the survival of this species has been hunting; their blubber oil and <strong>baleen</strong> were all highly prized (4). Between 1935 and 1965 over 30000 individuals were killed every year (7). At present there is evidence of man-made injuries to fin whales many of which have resulted from collisions with boats (9). Like other large whales they are also threatened by environmental change including noise and chemical pollution (10).,In 1985 the International Whaling Commission (IWC) banned the hunting of all whales by signatory states. The IWC regulates the International Convention for the Regulation of Whaling (1946) and also provides scientific advice to signatory states (11). Conservationists are worried however that these protection measures are a case of 'too little too late' the southern hemisphere is thought to support only 5000 fin whales and the northern seas hold just 2 to 3000 individuals (4).

Destructive fishing practices have also greatly reduced the fishing cat\u2019s main prey base. Additionally fishing cats are hunted for food medicine and body parts in some areas of their range and have been persecuted for taking domestic stock (1). The skin of the fishing cat has occasionally been observed in Asian markets although far less frequently than other cats (4).,The Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) lists the fishing cat on Appendix II under which permits are required for international traffic in this species (5). The fishing cat is also protected by national legislation over most of its range with the exception of Bhutan Malaysia and Vietnam (4). Legal protection is extremely difficult to enforce however and illegal poaching does take place (4) (5). In addition to enforcing protective legislation for this species it is crucial that there is protection of its wetland habitat. Habitat degradation has been the most significant contributor to the decline in numbers and this must be addressed if we are to maintain populations of this beautiful and extraordinary cat throughout its range across southern and southeast Asia.,,,,,,,,,,Oaxacan spinytail iguana, Oaxacan spiny-tailed iguana,Five-keeled spiny-tailed iguana ,Animalia,Chordata,Reptilia,Squamata,Iguanidae,Ctenosaura (1),Total male length: c. 47.5 cm (2)Total female length: c. 32 cm (2),The population of five-keeled spiny-tailed iguanas could decline by as much as 30 percent if current rates of habitat loss are maintained. In 2005 it was estimated that were fewer than 2500 individuals remaining in the wild (1).,Five-keeled spiny-tailed iguanas currently have no legal protection (1). The Lost Canyon Nature reserve does however offer a refuge for this species.

In 1988 approximately four percent of Negros and eight percent of Panay remained forested and in the last 20 years the forest composition of both islands has almost certainly declined further. Given that only ten percent of the remaining forest occurs at a suitable altitude for this lowland bird it is no surprise that the flame-templed babbler is classified as Endangered on the IUCN Red List (2). While it is considered relatively tolerant of <strong>secondary growth</strong> the rate of clearance is so rapid that its ability to survive in degraded forests is more and more limited (2) (4).,While the flame-templed babbler occurs within existing and proposed national parks on both Negros and Panay there are no specific conservation measures in place for this species (2) (7). Further surveys and studies are required to establish the location of important sites and the capacity of the species to survive in degraded habitats. This will provide decision makers with information on where to position additional protected areas and how forests can be managed to halt the species\u2019 population decline (2).,,,,,,,,,,Chat ÌÛ TÌ»te Plate,Flat-headed cat ,Animalia,Chordata,Mammalia,Carnivora,Felidae,Prionailurus (1),Male head-and-body length: 42 ‰ÛÒ 50 cm (2)Female head-and-body length: 33 ‰ÛÒ 37 cm (2)Male tail length: 13 ‰ÛÒ 20 cm (2)Female tail length: 15 ‰ÛÒ 17 cm (2)Male weight: 1.5 ‰ÛÒ 2.75 kg (2)Female weight: 1.5 kg (2),Although the exact status of this obscure seldom-encountered cat is not fully understood it may be especially vulnerable because of its apparent association with watercourses (4). Habitats along rivers are often the first to be exploited and encroached upon by humans as settlements and agriculture expand (5). Perhaps an even greater threat to the species is water pollution particularly by oil organochlorines and heavy metals associated with agricultural run-off and logging activities contaminating the cat\u2019s prey (1).,The flat-headed cat is fully protected across most of its range with hunting and trade prohibited in Indonesia Malaysia Myanmar and Thailand and hunting regulated in Singapore (1) although no legal protection is afforded in Brunei Borneo (7). However if the species is adaptable and can survive in palm-oil plantations as reports suggest then it may be able to cope with considerable habitat disturbance and the future would not seem quite so bleak (2).,,,,,,,,,,Queensland barred frog,Fleay‰Ûªs barred-frog ,Animalia,Chordata,Amphibia,Anura,Limnodynastidae,Mixophyes (1),Mixophyes (1),[],[],,,,,,,,,,Flecker‰Ûªs crayfish,Flecker's spiny crayfish ,Animalia,Arthropoda,Crustacea,Decapoda,Parastacidae,Euastacus (1),Occipital carapace length: up to 11.9 cm (2),Although Flecker\u2019s spiny crayfish is thought to be relatively common within its range it has a rather restricted and severely fragmented distribution. It also has quite specialised habitat requirements and any decline in the extent or quality of its habitat will therefore significantly affect its populations (1). The slow reproductive rate of Flecker\u2019s spiny crayfish makes it harder for the species to recover from any declines (1).,There are no specific conservation measures currently in place for Flecker\u2019s spiny crayfish (1) (3).

Threats to this species include increasing habitat fragmentation and loss resulting from shifting cultivation and urbanisation and habitat management techniques such as dry season burn-off (2).,The Flores scops-owl is listed on Appendix II of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) which means that trade in this species should be carefully controlled and monitored (4).,,,,,,,,,,Florida perforate cladonia, perforate reindeer lichen,Florida perforate reindeer lichen ,Fungi,Ascomycota,Lecanoromycetes,Lecanorales,Cladoniaceae,Cladonia (1),Cladonia (1),The main threats to the Florida perforate reindeer lichen are loss of habitat from development and disturbance by fires and hurricanes (1). In 1992 only 15 percent of Florida scrubland remained (6). Many populations of the Florida perforate reindeer lichen are found on high-value real estate making their long-term survival unlikely without any protection (1). Land conversion to citrus plantations and residential development continues to diminish scrub habitat almost daily (2).\xa0,In 1993 the Florida perforate reindeer lichen earned the distinction of being the first lichen to be placed on the U.S. Endangered Species List (7). This means that all landowners of state land with populations of this species are responsible for its protection and conservation. Additionally the state of Florida has an active conservation program which monitors listed species such as the Florida perforate reindeer lichen and works to conserve them through land acquisition and management. Under this programme at least two sites at Lake Wales Ridge have been purchased for conservation purposes (1).\xa0,,,,,,,,,Chela caeruleostigmata, Chela mouhoti,Flying minnow ,Animalia,Chordata,Actinopterygii,Cypriniformes,Cyprinidae,Laubuca (1),Laubuca (1),[],[],,,,,,,,,Celebes tortoise,Forsten's tortoise ,Animalia,Chordata,Reptilia,Testudines,Testudinidae,Indotestudo (1),2.5 kg (2),The destruction of habitat on the islands of Sulawesi and Halmahera is greatly threatening the survival of this tortoise which has a highly restricted range (2). In addition tortoises are hunted both for their meat and to supply the pet trade (1).,International trade in Forsten's tortoise is restricted by its listing on Appendix II of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) (3).

In particular an increase in agricultural land and logging for both timber and fuel wood has reduced the area available to this species. It has also been extensively hunted for food and for use in traditional \u201cmedicinal\u201d preparations. Part of the range of Francois\u2019 langur was heavily bombed during the Vietnam War killing individuals as well as damaging and defoliating their habitat (2) (8).,The development and maintenance of reserves is crucial to the survival of this species and combating hunting through the implementation of a ranger system in areas of sanctuary would also be of value. Educating consumers of traditional \u201cmedicines\u201d derived from threatened species would not only impact positively on Francois\u2019 langur but on many other endangered species (8). Francois\u2019 langur is found in several protected areas in both Vietnam and China. Two of these the Sinh Long-Lung Nhoi Species and Habitat Conservation Area and Nam Xuan Lac Species and Habitat Conservation Area both in Vietnam were created especially for the protection of this threatened species (1).,,,,,,,She balsam,Fraser fir ,Plantae,Tracheophyta,Coniferopsida,Coniferales,Pinaceae,Abies (1),Abies (1),[],[],,,,,,,,,,Cantor‰Ûªs giant softshell turtle,Frog-faced softshell turtle ,Animalia,Chordata,Reptilia,Testudines,Trionychidae,Pelochelys (1),up to 50 kg (2),Habitat loss and direct exploitation are the greatest threats to the frog-faced softshell turtle (1).,The frog-faced softshell turtle is currently listed on Appendix II of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) which means that the trade of this extraordinary turtle should be strictly monitored to prevent overexploitation (6).,,,,,,,,,,Akalat de Gabela,Gabela akalat ,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Muscicapidae,Sheppardia (1),Length: 13 cm (2),Prior to 1974 large areas of forest in Angola were lost to the establishment of coffee plantations but with the start of the civil war many of the plantations around the Gabela district were abandoned and the forest understorey recovered significantly.  With the cessation of hostilities in 2002 pressure on the forest will again increase as demand for agricultural land grows (4).  A growth in subsistence agriculture now poses the greatest threat to the Gabela akalat and other forest-dwelling birds of the region (2) (4).  In some areas 20 to 70 percent of canopy trees and all the undergrowth in valley bottoms are being cleared to plant bananas and sweet potatoes.  In other areas up to 95 percent of the forest canopy is being removed to plant cassava and maize (2).  In addition the re-establishment of coffee plantations would also have serious impacts on the Gabela akalat particularly if varieties that require shade (which thrive beneath the canopy of forests) were replaced by sun-tolerant varieties (which results in the destruction of the forest canopy) (4).,For the duration of the protracted civil war very little scientific research was undertaken in Angola.  Since the war was formally ended in 2002 surveys to determine the Gabela akalat\u2019s population size and distribution could now be carried out (2).  Ascertaining the call of this shy bird would be extremely useful in any future surveys that are undertaken; in 2004 a group of scientists first recorded a call emanating from the location of a Gabela akalat but more work is needed to confirm its repertoire (4).  The bird conservation organisation BirdLife International also recommends that the forest at Gabela should be designated as a protected area (2).,,,,,,,,,,Gabela bushshrike, Gabela bush-shrike,Gabela bush shrike ,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Malaconotidae,Laniarius (1),Length: 20 cm (2),Most of the forest the Gabela bush-shrike inhabits was selectively logged before the 27-year-long Angolan civil war started in 1975 and although there is no evidence of ongoing logging the forest continues to be a source of firewood for local people and is cleared to make way for subsistence agriculture (2) (4) (7). In some parts of its habitat 20 to 70 percent of canopy trees and all the undergrowth in valley bottoms is being cleared to plant bananas and sweet potatoes. In other areas up to 95 percent of the forest canopy is being removed to plant cassava and maize (8). While the Gabela bush-shrike is said to be fairly tolerant of degraded habitats (4) (7) numbers of this species are still believed to have declined over recent years (2).,The protection of a 50 square kilometre area inhabited by the Gabela bush-shrike was recommended in the early 1970s (8) as it is home to several endangered birds (4) but this has not yet been established (8). The creation of a protected area to ensure the survival of the Gabela bush-shrike remains a priority and a number of other conservation measures have also been recommended. These include conducting surveys to determine the Gabela bush-shrike\u2019s distribution and population size and studies to determine the species\u2019 habitat requirements. To address the issue of land-use change for farming ecotourism has been suggested as a viable addition to agriculture (2).,,,,,,,,,Bagadais de Gabela,Gabela helmet-shrike ,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Malaconotidae,Prionops (1),Length: 19 cm (2),Due to the restricted range of the Gabela helmet-shrike the destruction of its habitat poses the greatest threat to this species (4). Charcoal production is claiming large tracts of dry forest near the escarpment while other areas are being cleared to plant subsistence agricultural crops such as bananas sweet potato maize and cassava. In addition now that conflict has ended on the escarpment large-scale coffee planting and farming is now likely to resume claiming more of this imperilled bird\u2019s habitat (2).,The Gabela helmet-shrike is found in the Kissama National Park which affords a degree of protection against habitat destruction (2). Unfortunately however a proposal to create another protected area the Gabela Nature Reserve which would have helped to protect this species against the resumption of commercial activities on the escarpment has not materialised (2) (5). In order to ensure this species\u2019 survival surveys of its population and habitat should be conducted along with research into its ecology. In addition a conservation strategy for the Angolan escarpment and surrounding areas should be implemented including the promotion of ecotourism and a supplement to agriculture (2).,,,,,,,,,,Galapagos Islands fur seal,Galapagos fur seal ,Animalia,Chordata,Mammalia,Carnivora,Otariidae,Arctocephalus (1),Male length: up to 150 cm (2)Female length: up to 130 cm (2)Average male weight: 64 kg (3)Average female weight: 27 kg (3),During the 19th century the Galapagos fur seal was severely impacted by the large-scale commercial seal hunting that was rampant at the time (3) (8). By the early 20th century the Galapagos fur seal was believed to be extinct until a small colony was discovered in 1932-33 (8). Since then and following the end of extensive seal hunting (3) numbers have increased substantially (8) and the Galapagos fur seal is no longer exploited (2).,The Galapagos fur seal is fully protected by the Galapagos National Park Service under Ecuadorean law (2). It will also benefit from the management of the Galapagos Islands and the surrounding waters as a national park and marine reserve (5) (10). As one of the first sites to be designated a Natural World Heritage Site (10) the recognition of the Galapagos\u2019 incredible and unique ecosystem will hopefully ensure the preservation of the islands\u2019 fauna and flora for generations to come.,,,,,,,,,,Southern martin,Galapagos martin ,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Hirundinidae,Progne (1),Size: 15 cm (2),With a dangerously small population thought to total fewer than 1000 individuals and possibly fewer than 600 the Galapagos martin faces an uncertain future. Furthermore no more than 50 birds have been recorded at any one site. The population is likely to have declined over the last 200 years probably as a result of introduced diseases parasites and nest predators (e.g. rats <i>Rattus</i>) but current population trends and threats are unknown (3).,There are currently no known conservation measures underway to protect this bird. Due to a lack of data there is an urgent need for surveys throughout its range to determine accurate population estimates and trends. Research into the reasons for the bird\u2019s small population and possible decline is also needed. The information gained from such studies could help guide appropriate conservation measures in the future and hopefully help secure for this rare native bird a more certain and prosperous future (3).,,,,,,,,,,Zalophus californianus wollebaeki,Galapagos sea lion ,Animalia,Chordata,Mammalia,Carnivora,Otariidae,Zalophus (1),Male body length: 200 - 250 cm (2)Female body length: 150 - 200 cm (2)Male weight: 200 - 400 kg (2)Female weight: 50 - 110 kg (2),The Galapagos sea lion faces various threats. In the 19th century sea-lions worldwide were hunted for their meat skin and oil. The hunting of some sea-lions including the Galapagos species has now been banned and populations have recovered (2). Galapagos sea lions are still vulnerable to human activity as their inquisitive and social nature means they are more likely to approach areas inhabited by humans. This brings them into contact with fishing nets hooks and human waste all of which can be fatal (6). There are also problems resulting from the increase in numbers of deep-water tuna and billfish fisheries as these sea-lions become victims of <strong>bycatch</strong> (7). Research indicates that the majority of these incidents (67 percent) involve juveniles probably due to their more curious and playful nature (7).,The Galapagos sea lion occurs in one of the most biologically diverse areas of the world. The Galapagos Islands have long been studied and protected and were influential in the formulation of Darwin\u2019s theory of evolution by natural selection. Most recently in March 1998 a 133000 square kilometres area was designated as the Galapagos Marine Reserve making it one of the world\u2019s largest protected areas. Detailed conservation and research programmes have been developed which focus on studying the islands\u2019 ecology the effects of environmental fluctuations on species and the effects of humans on wildlife. These measures have to some extent protected this sea lion especially from hunting. The Charles Darwin Research Centre has implemented an ecological monitoring project of the Galapagos sea-lion to determine the state and abundance of the sea lions. This project also studies the ongoing threats to this mammal and has developed simple rescue methods for injured or caught sea lions. Elsewhere in the world sea lions are suffering dramatic population declines for unknown reasons and so conservation measures like these which both monitor and protect the sea lion are invaluable in the future of the Galapagos sea lion (7).,,,,,,,,,,Eleutherodactylus spilogaster,Gambita robber frog ,Animalia,Chordata,Amphibia,Anura,Strabomantidae,Pristimantis (1),Pristimantis (1),[],[],,,,,,,,,,blind river dolphin, Ganges dolphin, Ganges susu, Indus River dolphin, South Asian river dolphin, susu,Ganges river dolphin ,Animalia,Chordata,Mammalia,Cetartiodactyla,Platanistidae,Platanista (1),80åÊ- 90 kg (2),The Ganges drainage area is one of the most densely populated areas in the world being home to roughly one tenth of the world\u2019s human population and as such suffers enormous demand for its resources. A major threat to the Ganges river dolphin has been the extensive damming of rivers for irrigation and electricity generation which isolates populations and prevents seasonal migration (7). Other threats include chemical pollution boat traffic hunting and human disturbance. This species is hunted for oil fish bait and food by local people; accidental entanglement in fishing nets also occurs (5).,International trade is prohibited by the listing of the Ganges river dolphin on Appendix I of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) (3). It is also listed in the Agreement on the Conservation of Small <strong>Cetaceans</strong> of the Baltic and North Sea (ASCOBANS) under the auspices of the CMS (8). It is protected under the Indian Wildlife Act although these legislations require stricter enforcement (5). Proposed conservation measures include designated dolphin sanctuaries and the creation of additional habitat. Further research into the current distribution and abundance of this elusive river-dweller is urgently required in order to implement effective conservation measures (5).,,,,,Gardiner's Seychelles frog, Seychelles frog,Gardiner‰Ûªs tree frog ,Animalia,Chordata,Amphibia,Anura,Sooglossidae,Sooglossus (1),Length: up to 11 mm (2),Land clearance for agriculture human settlement timber and tourism are the main threats on the Seychelle Islands. The majority of the lowland forests have been disturbed or destroyed and coconut vanilla and cinnamon plantations now occupy most of the coastal plateaus (6). This habitat loss has contributed to the decline in numbers of this species in recent years. This species is now classified as Endangered by the IUCN (1).,The Seychelles Islands are considered as some of the most beautiful places on Earth and are extremely rich in terms of <strong>biodiversity</strong>. Many small reserves on the islands have been set up by the Seychelles Government and independent agencies to protect specific species and general habitat areas (3) (4). These efforts are important in the protection of the islands\u2019 wildlife though many species including the Gardiner\u2019s tree frog still remain threatened (7) (8). Much of the range on Mah\xe9 fall within the Morne Seychellois National Park and conservation of Silhouette island is managed by the Nature Protection Trust of Seychelles (9).,,,,,,,,,Peruvian woolly monkey,Geoffroy‰Ûªs woolly monkey ,Animalia,Chordata,Mammalia,Primates,Atelidae,Lagothrix (1),Male head-body length: 46 - 65 cm (2)Female head-body length: 46 - 58 cm (2)Tail length: 66 - 68 cm (2)Male weight: 9.5 kg (3)Female weight: 7.7 kg (3),Geoffroy\u2019s woolly monkey is desperately threatened by hunting (11) both for food and for the pet trade. Females with offspring are frequently targeted so that the babies may be sold into the pet trade. It has been reported that three hunters in the Western Amazon killed over 200 woolly monkeys in a little less than two years resulting in their local extinction (11) illustrating the devastating effect that hunting may have on this species. Deforestation is also a serious problem for Geoffroy\u2019s woolly monkey (1); forest is cleared to make way for agricultural land and in the south of its range as a result of mining for cassiterite (a mineral that is the chief source of tin) (11).\xa0,Luckily many of the areas in which Geoffroy\u2019s woolly monkey occurs are now protected within National Parks. In Bolivia the entire known range of the Geoffroy\u2019s woolly monkey is contained within two protected areas (1). It is also listed under Appendix II of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) meaning that any international trade in this species should be carefully monitored (4).,,,,,,,,,,Testudo geometrica, Testudo luteola, Testudo strauchi,Geometric tortoise ,Animalia,Chordata,Reptilia,Testudines,Testudinidae,Psammobates (1),Male length: up to 12 cm (2)Female length: up to 15 cm (2),The destruction of more than 90 percent of the <strong>renosterveld</strong> habitat in which the geometric tortoise resides has resulted in the depletion of tortoise numbers and the range of this species continues to be reduced (2) (8) (11).  This habitat loss has been the result of indiscriminate urban and agricultural development and unfortunately the geometric tortoise has proved to be intolerant of habitat modification (4) (12).  The <strong>fynbos biome</strong> and <strong>renosterveld</strong> vegetation is adapted to fire but too frequent unplanned and uncontrolled fires can result in local extinction of the geometric tortoise (4) (8).  In addition the spread of invasive alien vegetation in the region competes with and excludes important food items (8).  The geometric tortoise is occasionally eaten by farm workers and in the past it has been much sought after for the pet trade.  However the impact of these activities is negligible compared to the major threat of habitat degradation and destruction (4).,The geometric tortoise is protected by Western Cape Provincial legislation which is rigidly and effectively enforced (4) and it is listed on Appendix I of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) meaning that trade in this species is only permitted in exceptional circumstances (3).  In addition around 75 percent of the total population exists in formal protected areas (4) such as the Elandsberg Private Nature Reserve and a number of smaller provincial reserves (8).  However the majority of remaining geometric tortoise habitat is in the hands of private landowners and efforts are being made to secure the future of some of these sites through a conservation stewardship programme (13).  Captive breeding of the geometric tortoise has had limited success and is currently not considered a priority thus the primary focus of conservation efforts is to ensure its continued survival in the wild (4).  The continued enforcement of conservation legislation and vigilance towards the unscrupulous collection of animals for the pet trade is called for (2) while the maintenance of protected areas is essential.  In addition it is imperative that private landowners take custodianship of the last remaining <strong>renosterveld</strong> remnants that contain geometric tortoise populations in partnership with conservation agencies since it is practically not possible to buy enough land to protect formally (2).  Without such measures the <strong>renosterveld</strong> habitat and its endangered inhabitants may disappear completely.,,,,,,,,Germain‰Ûªs silver langur, Germain‰Ûªs silver leaf monkey, Indochinese lutung, Indochinese silvered langur,Germain's langur ,Animalia,Chordata,Mammalia,Primates,Cercopithecidae,Trachypithecus (1),Head-body length: 49 - 59 cm (2) (3)Tail length: 72 - 84 cm (2) (3),Although a relatively widespread species Germain\u2019s langur is very rare throughout most of its range (1) (3) and its population is believed to have more than halved in recent decades (1). The major threats to the species are hunting for food medicine and the pet trade and habitat loss mainly due to clearance for agriculture (1) (2) (3).,Germain\u2019s langur occurs in a number of protected areas including Phu Quoc and Cat Tien National Parks in Vietnam (1) and Phnom Samkos Wildlife Sanctuary in Cambodia (11). International trade in the species should be regulated under its listing on Appendix II of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) (4) and it is legally protected in Vietnam although greater enforcement of the laws as well as additional measures to control hunting and wildlife trade are urgently needed. Increased environmental education and the development of sustainable alternatives to forest destruction have also been proposed to protect the region\u2019s primates (3). Specific conservation measures recommended for Germain\u2019s langur include further research and survey work to better understand the species\u2019 status distribution and <strong>taxonomic</strong> relationships with related forms (1) (3).,,,,,,,Giant barred-frog, southern barred frog,Giant barred frog ,Animalia,Chordata,Amphibia,Anura,Limnodynastidae,Mixophyes (1),Mixophyes (1),[],[],,,,,,,,,Luzon bushy-tailed cloud rat, Philippine bushy-tailed rat,Giant bushy-tailed cloud rat ,Animalia,Chordata,Mammalia,Rodentia,Muridae,Crateromys (1),1.4 ‰ÛÒ 1.5 kg (3),The giant bushy-tailed cloud rat is actively hunted by the local people of central northern Luzon who value its meat and use its beautiful wool-like fur to make items (2) (5). Some giant bushy-tailed cloud rats have also been captured to be kept as pets. The deterioration and loss of forest habitat may also be threatening this species (5) as commercial agriculture population growth and poverty in the Philippines forces people to clear forest for cultivation at increasingly high altitudes (9).,The giant bushy-tailed cloud rat occurs in several national parks in northern Luzon (8) including Mount Pulag National Park (3). Hunting of this species is not permitted under Philippine law except by indigenous people using traditional methods (8).,,,,,,,,,devil fish, devil ray,Giant devilray ,Animalia,Chordata,Chondrichthyes,Rajiformes,Mobulidae,Mobula (1),Disc width: up to 520 cm (2)Length: up to 650 cm (2),Although the giant devilray is not targeted by fisheries it is accidentally captured at threatening levels such as by swordfish and tuna fisheries (1) (2). A decline in habitat quality particularly in the Mediterranean is also likely to be impacting populations of giant devilray though to what extent is not known (1). Its preference for inhabiting the surface of the oceans makes the giant devilray vulnerable to disturbance from maritime traffic and oil spills (1).,In 2005 the General Fisheries Commission for the Mediterranean adopted a measure to ban trawling below 1000 metres and banned driftnets throughout the Mediterranean (6). This is likely to have substantially reduced the threat of <strong>by-catch</strong> to the giant devilray in the Mediterranean. Raising awareness with fishermen to maximise the number of giant devilrays that are disentangled and released unharmed after accidental capture has also been recommended as an important measure to protect this magnificent oceanic animal (1).,,,,,,,,,Cuban flycatcher,Giant kingbird ,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Tyrannidae,Tyrannus (1),Length: 23 - 26 cm (2),While the giant kingbird occurs in naturally low densities it is becoming increasingly rare throughout Cuba. The reasons for the decline of this species are currently unclear but it is likely that the major threats are from habitat loss due to logging and the conversion of existing habitat for agriculture (2) (5) (6).,A project to discover more about the breeding ecology of the giant kingbird is currently being carried out in the Sierra de Najasa region of Cuba while surveys are also underway to define the species\u2019 precise distribution especially around Moa and in Pinar del R\xedo province.,,,,,,,,,,Pouched frog,Giant marsupial frog ,Animalia,Chordata,Amphibia,Anura,Leptodactylidae,Gastrotheca (1),Gastrotheca (1),[],[],,,,,,,,,,Loutre GÌ©ante Du BrÌ©sil,Giant otter ,Animalia,Chordata,Mammalia,Carnivora,Mustelidae,Pteronura (1),Male length: 1.5 - 1.8 m (2)Female length: 1.5 - 1.7 m (2)Male weight: 26 - 32 kg (2)Female weight: 22 - 26 kg (2),Up until the late 1970s the giant otter was excessively hunted for its valuable fur (2) (5) (8) with its naturally curious disposition making it a particularly easy target. The fur trade is less of a threat today thanks to protective legislation but illegal killing does still occur often due to perceived conflict with fishermen. Some cubs are taken from the wild to be kept as pets (4) and usually die in the hands of inexperienced caretakers. Habitat loss and fragmentation and pollution are currently the major threats to the survival of the giant otter with the areas in which they live being destroyed and degraded by mining logging and damming (2) (6) (8).,The giant otter is protected through much of its range and is listed on Appendix I of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) which effectively bans international trade (3).,,,,,,,,,,Grandidier‰Ûªs mongoose,Giant-striped mongoose ,Animalia,Chordata,Mammalia,Carnivora,Eupleridae,Galidictis (1),1 - 1.5 kg (2),One of the main problems facing the endangered giant-striped mongoose is its extremely limited range which is threatened by clearance for maize cultivation and livestock grazing (1).,The giant-striped mongoose is found in the protected area of the Parc National de Tsimanampetsotsa but due to human expansion its range is decreasing. There are no specific conservation measures in place for the giant-striped mongoose and further studies of this species are needed to see what strategies would be effective in aiding conservation efforts (1).,,,,,,,,,,Ha‰Ûªiwale,Giffard‰Ûªs cyrtandra ,Plantae,Tracheophyta,Magnoliopsida,Scrophulariales,Gesneriaceae,Cyrtandra (1),Cyrtandra (1),[],[],,,,,,,,,,Randia sericea,Glionnetia ,Plantae,Tracheophyta,Magnoliopsida,Rubiales,Rubiaceae,Glionnetia (1),Height: up to 6 m (2),Invasion of alien species such as <em>Psidium cattleianum </em>and <em>Cinnamomum verum</em> is the main threat to this species causing competition for resources and habitat degradation. Other threats to <em>Glionnetia sericea</em>\xa0include wildfires and poor regeneration with no observable reproduction in certain areas while its restricted range makes it particularly vulnerable to extinction. <em>Glionnetia sericea</em>\xa0is particularly threatened on the island of Mah\xe9 where its population is on the verge of extinction (1).,<em>Glionnetia sericea</em> is found in the Morne Seychellois National Park a protected area. This species should be given high priority for conservation as it is <strong>endemic</strong> to the Seychelles and is a unique species being the only member of its <strong>genus</strong> (1).,,,,,,,,,,Calumma globifera, Calumma globiferum,Globe-horned chameleon ,Animalia,Chordata,Reptilia,Squamata,Chamaeleonidae,Calumma (1),Calumma (1),[],[],,,,,,,,,Ballmann‰Ûªs malimbe,Gola malimbe ,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Ploceidae,Malimbus (1),Malimbus (1),[],[],,,,,,,,,,Buthraupis aureocincta,Gold-ringed tanager ,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Thraupidae,Bangsia (1),Length: 16 cm (2),The main threat faced by the gold-ringed tanager is deforestation for building projects. In particular there are currently attempts to build a road through one of the few forests in which this species is known to exist which could possibly lead to logging mining and human settlement in the area (2).,The gold-ringed tanager is currently protected in the Tatam\xe1 National Park and in the Las Orqu\xeddeas National Park. Also a management plan is in preparation for the area of the Alto de Pisiones which should further protect some of the habitat of this species (2).,,,,,,,,,,HapalÌ©mur DorÌ©,Golden bamboo lemur ,Animalia,Chordata,Mammalia,Primates,Lemuridae,Hapalemur (1),1 - 1.5 kg (2),Mainly threatened by habitat loss through slash-and-burn agriculture (6) although\xa0the golden bamboo lemur\xa0may also be under threat from hunting for food and for the pet trade (5). Recent estimates believe that there are under 400 individuals remaining in the wild (4).,In 1991 three areas of land around the village of Ranomafana were designated as Ranomafana National Park. Furthermore the area in Andringitra that supports this species is a strict nature reserve and made the transition to a National Park in October 1999 (7). The\xa0golden bamboo lemur\xa0within these areas are therefore afforded a degree of protection (5) but slash-and-burn agriculture is encroaching at the park boundaries (6). Although Malagasay law forbids the hunting killing and capturing of all lemurs (4) problems may still arise as the law is difficult to enforce (5). At present there is a very small captive population in Madagascar but there is no co-ordinated breeding programme (5).,,,,,,,,,,Barril dorado, Biznaga amarilla, Biznaga dorada, Bola de oro,Golden barrel cactus ,Plantae,Tracheophyta,Magnoliopsida,Caryophyllales,Cactaceae,Echinocactus (1),Echinocactus (1),[],[],,,,,,,Entelle DorÌ©e, Langur DorÌ©, SemnopithÌ¬que De Gee, SemnopithÌ¬que DorÌ©,Golden langur ,Animalia,Chordata,Mammalia,Primates,Cercopithecidae,Trachypithecus (1),9.5 - 12 kg (2),Currently there is little information on the population size and distribution of the golden langur. Large areas of forest in this part of Asia have been cleared for timber and to make way for developments and agriculture and it may be that these monkeys are now mainly restricted to forest reserves which are themselves under threat from illegal logging (7).,International trade in this species is banned by its listing on Appendix I of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) (3). Golden langurs are protected within a number of reserves such as the Manas National Park in Assam; a World Heritage Site that has suffered from conflict in the past but which is now undergoing a rehabilitation programme (8). The American-based conservation organisation Community Conservation is working with the Assam government on reforestation programmes and also on improving community education on the issues involved (7).,,,,,,,Singe-lion, Tamarin Soyeux,Golden lion tamarin ,Animalia,Chordata,Mammalia,Primates,Callitrichidae,Leontopithecus (1),400 - 800 g (3),A staggering ninety percent of the original area of Atlantic coastal forest has been destroyed through logging and clearance for cultivation and development (9). The habitat of the golden lion tamarin has therefore been drastically reduced and fragmented into isolated patches. A former threat to the species in the wild came from the collection of live individuals for private collections and zoos (6) but this practice became illegal in the 1970s and subsequently decreased (5). Occasionally specimens will still turn up in a local market (5) but the pet trade now has relatively little impact on numbers (2). Further more captive breeding in zoos and subsequent <strong>re-introductions</strong> have literally helped save this species from extinction so its former collection for zoos has also had a very positive impact (2).,Fortunately the golden lion tamarin has been the subject of a large-scale determined conservation effort. A captive breeding programme aims to maintain a zoo population of 500 individuals and since 1984 captive-bred individuals have been re-introduced to the wild (6) (10). Furthermore released individuals have successfully reared young in the wild (6). A huge conservation education programme in Brazil has raised the profile of the golden lion tamarin and the species is now widely regarded with pride as a national symbol of conservation (10). In 1980 the wild population had reached an all time low of less than 100 individuals (11) but by 2000 this had increased to 1000 424 of which were re-introduced from captive stock (12). Despite these efforts the species still requires protection and continued conservation efforts if it is to evade extinction. (5).,,,,,,,,,Golden conure, Queen of Bavaria conure,Golden parakeet ,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Psittaciformes,Psittacidae,Guaruba (1),Length: 34 cm (2),Although the golden parakeet has probably always been relatively scarce its numbers have been declining for some time. At the turn of the millennium just 1000 to 2500 golden parakeets were estimated to be remaining in the wild (2). Undoubtedly deforestation and rampant exploitation for the caged-bird trade are chiefly responsible for its precarious status (2) (5). Road construction development and logging have depleted and fragmented large areas of biologically rich rainforests which the golden parakeet utilises for nesting roosting and foraging (2) (4). At the same time with high demand for this species in the caged-bird trade illegal trapping continues apace (10). Sadly it is also hunted for food feathers and sport and to reduce damage to crops (2).,The golden parakeet is protected by Brazilian law and since 1973 has been listed under Appendix I of the Convention on International in Endangered Species (CITES) which permits trade in this species only under exceptional circumstances (2) (3). Unfortunately the human and financial resources available to prevent wildlife exploitation are limited and consequently illegal trapping remains prolific and many birds continue to be smuggled out of Brazil (6) (10). There is a population of golden parakeet in the fairly well protected Tapaj\xf3s National Park but reserves can be limited in their effectiveness because of this species\u2019 nomadic behaviour (2). There is cause for optimism however as in 2001 the Golden Conure Survival Fund was established (4) (8). This has been instrumental in raising significant funds to support much needed research into the species\u2019 population and threats. Furthermore it is anticipated that future funds will be used to help implement direct conservation initiatives such as land purchase education of local people and law enforcement (8) (9) (10).,,,,,,,,,Sichuan golden snub-nosed monkey,Golden snub-nosed monkey ,Animalia,Chordata,Mammalia,Primates,Cercopithecidae,Rhinopithecus (1),Head-body length: 57 - 76 cm (2)Tail length: 51 - 72 cm (2)Male weight: 15 ‰ÛÒ 39 kg (3)Female weight: 6.5 ‰ÛÒ 10 kg (3),The golden snub-nosed monkey has long been hunted for use in traditional medicines with the pelt of the species once thought to prevent rheumatism as well as for its fur and meat. Today this hunting continues with this exploitation compounded by the ongoing loss of its forest habitat (1) (2) (5).,This endearing primate is found in a number of protected areas including Baihe Nature Reserve Foping Nature Reserve Shennongjia Nature Reserve and Wanglang Nature Reserve (1). The golden snub-nosed monkey is also listed on Appendix I of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) meaning that international trade in this species is prohibited (4).\xa0,,,,,,,,,,Golden-bellied tree shrew, Mentawai treeshrew,Golden-bellied treeshrew ,Animalia,Chordata,Mammalia,Scandentia,Tupaiidae,Tupaia (1),Tupaia (1),[],[],,,,,,,,,giant fruit bat, golden-crowned flying fox,Golden-capped fruit bat ,Animalia,Chordata,Mammalia,Chiroptera,Pteropodidae,Acerodon (1),up to 1.1 kg (3),Once considered common (2) the golden-capped fruit bat is now threatened with imminent extinction (5).   As a result of deforestation and hunting populations all over the Philippines have declined considerably and this species has vanished entirely from a number of islands (5).  The natural habitat of the Philippines is amongst the most threatened in the world with only six to seven percent of the original <strong>primary forest</strong> remaining largely due to extensive commercial logging (8).  This undoubtedly has had a significant impact on the golden-capped fruit bat which favours <strong>primary forest</strong> (5).,While the golden-capped fruit bat is thought to occur in some protected areas (5) further action is urgently needed to prevent the extinction of this species.  In 1992 an action plan developed for the conservation of Old World fruit bats outlined a number of conservation measures recommended for this species.  Due to the problems with enforcing any hunting controls the plan recommended that the most effective method of protection would be to manage colonies on small islands where suitable habitat remains and where protection efforts would have a better chance of success (5).  In 2003 the Philippine Endemic Species Conservation Project implemented a programme for the protection of the golden-capped fruit bat on the tiny island of Boracay off the northwest corner of Panay.  The project\u2019s achievements included nearly eliminating hunting of the colony (9).  In combination with conservation efforts in the wild captive breeding may eventually be necessary to ensure the long-term survival of the golden-capped fruit bat (5).,,,,,,,,,Tattersall's sifaka,Golden-crowned sifaka ,Animalia,Chordata,Mammalia,Primates,Indriidae,Propithecus (1),3.5 kg (2),Of all lemurs the golden-crowned sifaka has one of the most limited distributions (3). Vast tracts of their habitat have been cleared and the isolated patches of forest that remain are under pressure from logging and bush fires (2). The species is also hunted in some areas (2) and the recent discovery of gold in the region has resulted in an influx of miners causing further habitat loss and the hunting of lemurs for food (4).,Recent studies have shown that these sifakas are fairly abundant in some of the remaining forest fragments within their range and estimates put the population at between 6200 and 10000 individuals (7). Based on these figures it has been suggested that the World Conservation Union (IUCN) should reclassify the species as Endangered (7). At present the captive population of golden-crowned sifakas numbers just three at the Duke University Primate Centre (4). The species does not currently occur within a protected area (2) but is listed under Class A of the African Convention on the Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources whereby hunting killing capture or collection of individuals is forbidden unless for scientific purposes and with permission (6). A network of protected areas has been proposed to conserve the remaining forest fragments in which the golden-crowned sifaka is found (7).,,,,,,,,,,Gold and black lion tamarind,Golden-headed lion tamarin ,Animalia,Chordata,Mammalia,Primates,Callitrichidae,Leontopithecus (1),480 ‰ÛÒ 700 g (2),Golden-headed lion tamarins are among the world\u2019s most critically endangered mammals (8). Their habitat is one of the first to be cleared because they live in lowland forests. Currently only 2-5% of its original habitat remains (3) the rest being removed for timber or charcoal and to make way for plantations cattle pasture and industry (7). Eastern and South-eastern Brazil was also one of the first areas to be colonised almost 500 years ago and is now one of the most densely inhabited areas in Brazil exerting huge pressures on the land\u2019s resources (5) (8). Critically low numbers in the wild are due almost exclusively to habitat loss (2). This primate also suffers losses because of natural predators such as ocelots snakes hawks and eagles. In addition this species has suffered from trade as its amazing appearance makes it a prize pet and very popular in zoos (7) (9). However captive breeding in zoos and subsequent reintroductions have also helped save this species from extinction so its former collection for zoos has also had a very positive impact (2). Since it has been listed as Endangered by the IUCN and hunting and trade of the species has been banned (1) (4) it is hoped that hunting no longer poses a threat though sadly there are still occasional reports of illegal trade in this species (7). Deforestation and habitat loss however are more difficult problems to solve (6).,In the 1970s the numbers of these monkeys in zoos were declining as fast as those in the wild (5) (7). At this time researchers from the National Zoological Park in Washington DC developed techniques for successfully breeding this species in captivity and created a conservation plan to implement genetic and demographic management of the captive population involving long term studies of the species educating local communities about conservation efforts and increasing the extent of protected habitats (5).,,,,,,,,,,Golden-rumped sengi,Golden-rumped elephant-shrew ,Animalia,Chordata,Mammalia,Macroscelidea,Macroscelididae,Rynchocyon (1),540 g (2),Numbers of the golden-rumped elephant-shrew are severely threatened by habitat destruction along the Kenyan coast. Forests are being relentlessly cleared for farming development and timber collection (4). Illegal trapping of these sengis for food also occurs although current levels are thought to be sustainable (4).,The golden-rumped sengi occurs mainly in the Arabuko-Sokoke Forest in Kenya (6) which receives a degree of protection from the Kenyan Wildlife Service (7).,,,,,,,,,,ant-bed parrot, golden-winged parrot,Golden-shouldered parrot ,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Psittaciformes,Psittacidae,Psephotus (1),54 ‰ÛÒ 56 g (3),The golden-shouldered parrot has a small restricted and decreasing range (2) suffering principally from predation possibly in combination with a shortage of food in the early wet season. (8). Both threats have come about as a result of a change in fire regime in combination with cattle grazing (8). Fire is a feature of their natural environment and the parrots are a fire-dependent species with fire maintaining their habitat and the availability of essential foods (9). A lack of burning or burning at the wrong time of year in association with cattle grazing which has reduced fuel loads has resulted in the invasion of woodland throughout the species\u2019 former range. The increase in woody vegetation is thought to have favoured predators such as the pied butcherbird (<i>Cracticus nigrogularis</i>). Predation of adults is a major cause of nest failure with almost one third of nests losing one or more adults (2). The shortage of food that occurs annually during the wet season may be made worse by the lack of early wet season burning and selective grazing by introduced cattle of early-seeding perennial grasses (7) (5). In addition feral pigs preferentially eat the same important grass species and reduce recruitment of the termite mounds used for nesting (7). Intensive conservation efforts have stemmed the long-term decline of the golden-shouldered parrot in closely monitored sites but in less well-monitored sites the population is probably still declining (1) (7).,Golden-shouldered parrots have been studied in detail for over 16 years and during this time land and fire management have been adjusted across much of its range to suit the parrot\u2019s ecological requirements (9). Over these years completed or current management actions include analysis of threats changing fire regimes vegetation change annual monitoring and supplementary feeding of the Artemis Station population and surveys of populations and nests in the remainder of the bird\u2019s range. Other actions include fencing and implementation of favourable fire regimes on leasehold land and National Parks signing of a conservation agreement with land-holders and inclusion of conservation requirements for the species in property planning in central Cape York Peninsula (2). As a result of these measures the bird\u2019s range which contracted greatly between 1992 and 1998 may now have stabilized (9). A small proportion of the parrot\u2019s range occurs inside the Staaten River National Park and reintroductions into Mungkan Kandju National Park are also planned (9). It has been advocated that future conservation efforts focus on providing supplementary food during the wet-season developing and refining a pastoral management strategy and securing land under conservation agreements (2). It has been estimated that around 1500 golden-shouldered parrots are held in captivity in Australia (3) with considerable numbers bred in captivity each season (6). A sustainable future for this bird in captivity is therefore safeguarded ensuring that this beautiful parrot is with us for a long time to come (6). The bird\u2019s prospects in the wild however currently appear somewhat bleaker despite considerable conservation efforts and successes and far more needs to be done if this enchanting bird is to be saved in its natural habitat where it belongs.,,,,,,,,,Keule, Queule,Gomortega ,Plantae,Tracheophyta,Magnoliopsida,Laurales,Gomortegaceae,Gomortega (1),Gomortega (1),[],[],,,,,,,,,Ornate tree-kangaroo,Goodfellow‰Ûªs tree kangaroo ,Animalia,Chordata,Mammalia,Diprotodontia,Macropodidae,Dendrolagus (1),6 to 10 kg (2),Goodfellow\u2019s tree kangaroo is considered Endangered as a result of over-hunting and habitat loss (3). Hunted for its meat this species appears to be extremely vulnerable to poaching having rapidly disappeared from areas of intensive hunting even by surprisingly small human populations (6). Dwindling habitat is also a major cause for concern with forest having been destroyed due to logging mining oil exploration and agriculture. Lowland rainforest has undergone extensive clearance and those populations still surviving in highland forest have been fragmented and isolated markedly limiting their opportunity for out-breeding (3).,Its occurrence in a reasonable number of National Parks and reserves has helped ensure the survival of Goodfellow\u2019s tree kangaroo as has the almost complete lack of any large tree-climbing predators or competitors (3). However there are currently no direct conservation measures in place for this endangered species which will require greater protection of its rapidly diminishing habitat and stricter restrictions to hunting if it is to recover.,,,,,,,,,,Gorgeted wood quail,Gorgeted wood-quail ,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Galliformes,Odontophoridae,Odontophorus (1),ca. 302 g (2),In 2008 the gorgeted wood-quail was downlisted by the IUCN from Critically Endangered to Endangered after surveys found it to be more widespread than previously thought (3). However the species is still under serious threat from hunting and habitat loss with most of its habitat having already been converted to agriculture plantations and grazing land and the remaining forest reduced to tiny isolated patches (2) (3) (6) (7). The highly restricted and fragmented range of the gorgeted wood-quail encompassing an area no more than 280 kilometres in length together with its small population size makes it particularly vulnerable to any threats (2) (3). As a ground-dwelling species it may also have a limited ability to disperse (5) making a lack of habitat connectivity particularly detrimental to its survival.,The gorgeted wood-quail receives some protection within the Guanent\xe1-Alto R\xedo Fonce Flora and Fauna Sanctuary and the adjacent Cachalu Biological Reserve and efforts have been underway to set up research projects in these areas (2) (3) (6) (7). Fundaci\xf3n ProAves have undertaken population studies in Serran\xeda de los Yarigu\xedes as well as distributing educational materials to local people (3) (5) and further studies have been recommended to assess and monitor the population survey further sites investigate the level of hunting pressure and assess the species\u2019 use of <strong>secondary forest</strong> (3) (5) (6) (7). Effective protection of the remaining forest areas is needed and if this rare forest quail is found to also occur at any additional sites it will be important to ensure that these also receive adequate protection (3) (6) (7).,,,,,,,,,,Drongo de Grand Comore,Grand Comoro drongo ,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Dicruridae,Dicrurus (1),Length: 24 cm (2),Forests on Grand Comoro Island are a highly threatened habitat due to a very high and increasing human population converting the forest for agriculture. Any remaining natural forest is highly fragmented. However the forests on the slope of Mount Karthala are not very suitable for agriculture and therefore may be spared this fate (5). Introduced species may also pose a threat; rats are known to be abundant within forests on Grand Comoro Island and may predate the nests of the drongo (2). As the Grand Comoro drongo is found only surrounding an active volcano a volcanic eruption could potentially have devastating consequences for this bird.,A protected area has been proposed for Mount Karthala but this has not yet been established (5). If such vital forest habitat is not protected there is a high risk of further habitat loss and possibly the loss of many <strong>endemic</strong> species including the Grand Comoro drongo.,,,,,,,,,,Humblot's flycatcher,Grand Comoro flycatcher ,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Muscicapidae,Humblotia (1),Humblotia (1),[],[],,,,,,,,,,Renala baobab,Grandidier‰Ûªs baobab ,Plantae,Tracheophyta,Magnoliopsida,Malvales,Bombacaceae,Adansonia (1),Height: 25 m (2)Diameter: 3 m (2),<i>Adansonia grandidieri</i> is the most heavily exploited of all the Malagasy baobabs (2).  The seeds and the vitamin C-rich fruit pulp are eaten fresh and cooking oil is extracted from the oil-rich seeds.  The fruit is either collected from the ground or wooden pegs are hammered into the trunk so the tree can be climbed to collect the fruit (2).  The thick bark of the baobab is composed of tough long fibres that can be used to make ropes and the majority of trees bear scars from where the bark was cut from ground level to about two meters to obtain this material (2).  The spongy wood is comprised of sheets of fibre that are collected from dead or living trees dried in the sun and sold for thatch (2).  Most of these varied uses do not involve the tree being killed and thus are unlikely to pose a great threat to the baobab.  The greatest threat to this species has come from the transformation of its forest habitat into agricultural land.  Within these disturbed habitats there is a noticeable lack of young trees.  Fires seed predation competition from weeds and an altered physical environment might be affecting the ability of the Madagacar baobab to reproduce (2) which may have devastating consequences for its survival.,Numerous non-governmental organisations and scientists along with the Malagasy government realise the importance of conserving the unique biodiversity of Madagascar and are working to protect this magnificent island and its diverse fauna and flora (4).  One measure from which Grandidier\u2019s baobab is likely to benefit is the designation of protected areas.  In 2003 the President of Madagascar vowed to triple the amount of protected areas (5); a pledge that won\u2019t only help the magnificent giant baobab but also the Malagasy people whose livelihoods depend on the preservation of their watersheds and forests.,,,,,,,,,,Grauer‰Ûªs brush warbler, Grauer‰Ûªs rush warbler, Grauer‰Ûªs swamp-warbler,Grauer‰Ûªs scrub-warbler ,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Sylviidae,Bradypterus (1),15 ‰ÛÒ 19 g (2),The montane swamps which the Grauer\u2019s scrub-warbler inhabits are not well protected and therefore habitat destruction and alteration poses the greatest threat to this species.  The largest population occurs in Rugezi swamp Rwanda (3); an area which is being degraded and encroached by agriculture (2).  Many smaller swamp sites particularly those near dense human settlements are also being drained for cultivation or pasture (2) (3).,Several of the swamps which Grauer\u2019s scrub-warblers inhabit are protected within national parks such Bwindi-Impenetrable Forest National Park Uganda and Kahuzi-Bi\xe9ga National Park Democratic Republic of Congo (2) (both World Heritage Sites) (5).  However the latter is not secure (3) having been badly affected by influxes of Rwandan refugees and rebel soldiers (6).  Rugezi swamp in Rwanda home to the largest population of Grauer\u2019s scrub-warblers urgently needs protection (3).  An action plan which outlines a strategy to improve the conservation status of the Grauer\u2019s scrub warbler was published in 2006.  Priority actions include determining the distribution population size and trends of the species and minimising the impact of human activities at key sites (4).  Hopefully these measures will lessen the Grauer\u2019s scrub-warbler\u2019s risk of extinction.,,,,,,,,Buffon‰Ûªs macaw,Great green macaw ,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Psittaciformes,Psittacidae,Ara (1),Length: 85 ‰ÛÒ 90 cm (2),The decline in abundance of the great green macaw can be largely attributed to a loss of habitat throughout the region. Lowland forests have been converted to banana plantations and cattle ranching thus producing habitat that is no longer suitable for this parrot (2). In Costa Rica the mountain almond is logged as a valuable tropical hardwood used for flooring and truck beds; this tree provides vital food and shelter for the great green macaw and its removal has had devastating consequences to the species (8). In addition this highly attractive parrot is under demand from the illegal pet trade and may be captured as a result (2). In both Ecuador and Costa Rica numbers of the great green macaw are worryingly low (2).,The great green macaw is protected by law and international trade is prohibited by its listing on Appendix I of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) (3). The DariBiosphere Reserve Panama and the Los KatNational Park in Colombia protect the species\u2019 strongholds (2). The Great Green Macaw Research and Conservation Project has been working in Costa Rica since 1994 to raise awareness and carry out research into this stunning species (6). This parrot is an important flagship species as it is such a habitat specialist; its protection will help to conserve other rainforest species. The proposed creation of the Maquenque National Park would protect vital remaining habitat (6) of this species. A ban on logging of the mountain almond has also been proposed (2).,,,,,,,,,,great hammerhead shark, horned shark, squat-headed hammerhead shark,Great hammerhead ,Animalia,Chordata,Chondrichthyes,Carcharhiniiformes,Sphyrnidae,Sphyrna (1),Maximum length: 610 cm (2)Length at birth: 56 ‰ÛÒ 70 cm (2)Average weight: 230 kg (3)Maximum weight: 500 kg (2),The great hammerhead is targeted both directly and also taken as <strong>bycatch</strong> (1). It is prized for its fins for shark fin soup as well as for its liver oil for vitamins its skin for leather and its meat for fishmeal (2). Catastrophic losses have occurred in the eastern Atlantic where directed fishing is unregulated while in the Gulf of Mexico and north-west Atlantic this species has suffered serious declines as a result of high mortality when caught accidently by commercial fisheries. Illegal fishing of this species for its valuable fins is also increasing in Australian waters. Like most other sharks the great hammerhead's\xa0slow growth and low number of offspring makes it highly vulnerable to overexploitation (1).,The great hammerhead is in urgent need of coordinated conservation efforts involving the management of directed fisheries and those that take this species as <strong>bycatch</strong>. Fortunately the increasing recognition of the detrimental effects of shark finning has led to the implementation of finning bans by fishing states in the U.S.A. Australia and the European Union. Nevertheless improved enforcement of legislation is required to prevent ongoing illegal finning activities. <strong>Bycatch</strong> limits for sharks in the South African longline fishery are also helping to conserve this imperilled species (1).,,,,,,,,Eleutherodactylus thymalopsoides,Greater Pilalo robber frog ,Animalia,Chordata,Amphibia,Anura,Strabomantidae,Pristimantis,Pristimantis,[],[],,,,,,,,,,Growling grass frog, southern bell frog, warty bell frog,Green and gold frog ,Animalia,Chordata,Amphibia,Anura,Hylidae,Litoria (1),Litoria (1),[],[],,,,,,,,Burmese peafowl, Green-necked peafowl, Java peafowl,Green peafowl ,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Galliformes,Phasianidae,Pavo (1),Length of male: 244 cm (2)Length of female: 100 ‰ÛÒ 110 cm (2),Inevitably the green peafowl is hunted for its extravagant train feathers but also for meat. Chicks and eggs are collected for the pet trade and farmers poison adults as they are thought of as a crop-pest particularly in China. Habitat change and disturbance are also threats reducing breeding success (2).,Green peafowl populations are found in many of the protected areas across the range and wide-ranging public education programmes have been held throughout China and Laos. Distribution and status surveys are necessary to establish the effects of habitat fragmentation and education programmes such as those in China and Laos should be extended into Burma and Cambodia. More protected areas would also be beneficial but it is important to ensure that hunting bans are enforced in these areas. Green peafowl are currently listed on Appendix II of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora but there are calls for it to be upgraded to Appendix I to enforce a total ban on trade in live birds and train feathers (2).,,,,,,,,Polypedates pleurostictus, Polypedates variabilis, Rhacophorus parkeri, Rhacophorus variabilis,Green tree frog ,Animalia,Chordata,Amphibia,Anura,Rhacophoridae,Ghatixalus (1),Ghatixalus (1),[],[],,,,,,,Tortue Comestible, Tortue Franche, Tortue Verte,Green turtle ,Animalia,Chordata,Reptilia,Testudines,Cheloniidae,Chelonia (1),65 - 136.2 kg (2),The green turtle is overharvested in many areas for both its meat and eggs (11). The meat is highly prized and the cartilage underneath the <strong>plastron</strong> (known as 'calipee') is used in the production of turtle soup (8). In addition the green turtle is affected by a number of incidental threats including fisheries <strong>bycatch</strong> habitat degradation and disease. Building construction beach armouring and sand extraction are responsible for degradation of nesting habitat while light pollution at nesting beaches fatally attracts emerging green turtle hatchlings away from the sea. In the marine environment increased effluent over harvesting of algae and contamination from coastal development all negatively affect the quality of foraging habitat. In particular the degradation of marine habitats is implicated in the increase of fibropapillomas; fibrous tumours that can grow on almost any part of a turtles body impeding movement or sight and often leading to death (1).,The green turtle is protected by a raft of international legislation including the prohibition of international trade through its listing on Appendix I of CITES (1) (3). The result of numerous designations and agreements has been to notably reduce the intensity of direct impacts on the green turtle and in particular the rate at which eggs and adults are harvested. Nonetheless human impacts on the green turtle are still a significant concern with the lack of effective monitoring of fisheries responsible for considerable direct and indirect mortality while uncontrolled development continues to degrade the ecosystems that the green turtle depends on (1).,,,,,,,,amapola, Mexican red-headed parrot, red-crowned Amazon, red-crowned parrot,Green-cheeked Amazon ,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Psittaciformes,Psittacidae,Amazona (1),Length: 33 cm (2)Wingspan: 40 cm (3),With a street value of between $900 and $1200 (3) the green-cheeked Amazon is massively exploited for the pet trade. As a beautiful bird which talks occasionally the green-cheeked Amazon is a popular pet and consequently thousands of chicks are taken from nests each year. Adding to this problem poachers often fell or damage nesting trees preventing their use in subsequent breeding seasons. With little else affecting their decline the green-cheeked Amazon is an endangered species as a result of supplying humans with exotic pets (5).,Whilst protected under international law (Appendix I of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species) and Mexican law (Nom 059) as well as occurring in two of Mexico\u2019s Biosphere Reserves poaching is still a massive problem. It is thought that awareness of the danger posed to this species is growing among rangers but measures to halt its decline it have not yet been taken (5).,,,,,,,Dryopsophus brevipalmatus,Green-thighed frog ,Animalia,Chordata,Amphibia,Anura,Hylidae,Litoria (1),Litoria (1),[],[],,,,,,,,,,ZÌ¬bre De GrÌ©vy,Grevy‰Ûªs zebra ,Animalia,Chordata,Mammalia,Perissodactyla,Equidae,Equus (1),350åÊ- 450 kg (2),Numbers of Grevy\u2019s zebra underwent a dramatic decline in the 1970s when the coat became prized on the international fashion circuit (4). In the 1980s there were 15000 Grevy\u2019s zebra with this numbering crashing to around 2500 today representing an 83 percent decline in the global population over the last three decades (7). Commercial poaching for skins has since declined due to effective protection measures put in place by Kenya and the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES). However in some areas Grevy\u2019s zebra is still hunted for subsistence meat and some ethnic groups use their fat for medicinal purposes such as treating tuberculosis. Habitat loss presents a major threat to the long-term survival of the species as grasslands and water sources have significantly declined due to unplanned grazing by livestock. In addition there has been a significant very recent decline in the species in northern Kenya due to disease and drought (7).,Grevy\u2019s zebra is listed on Appendix I of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) effectively banning international trade in this species (3). It is protected by law in Ethiopia and by a hunting ban in Kenya (1). This rare species also occurs mostly outside protected areas in communally-owned land and ranches where livestock-keeping is the principal livelihood (7). In addition the Lewa Wildlife Conservancy in Kenya currently holds 370 individuals representing 15 percent of the world\u2019s total population (8).,,,,,,,,,,East African crowned crane, South African crowned crane, southern crowned crane,Grey crowned-crane ,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Gruiformes,Gruidae,Balearica (1),3 - 4 kg (2),The principal threat to grey crowned-crane populations is the loss or degradation of suitable wetland habitat due to an increasing human population accelerating the demand for agricultural land and freshwater sources.\xa0Increased grazing pressures subtly alter wetland habitats and influence the abundance of insect prey and the availability of nest habitat (5). Increasing human populations also threaten grey crowned-crane habitat via wetland damming drainage increased sedimentation through deforestation and the use of agricultural pesticides (2) (7) (9).\xa0Further threats to the grey crowned-crane include the removal of live birds and eggs and this activity has been attributed to a recent rapid decline throughout much of the species\u2019 range (7).,The grey crowned-crane is listed under Appendix II of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) meaning that international trade in this species requires permits and must be carefully monitored (3).,,,,,,,,Brelich's snub-nosed langur, Brelich's snub-nosed monkey, gray snub-nosed monkey, Guizhou snub-nosed langur, Guizhou snub-nosed monkey,Grey snub-nosed monkey ,Animalia,Chordata,Mammalia,Primates,Cercopithecidae,Rhinopithecus (1),Head-body length: 64 - 73 cm (2)Tail length: 70 - 97 cm (2) (3)Male weight: c. 15 kg (3)Female weight: c. 8 kg (3),One of the major threats to the grey snub-nosed monkey is accidental injury or death caused by non-targeted hunting. For example this species may be caught in snares that were set for other animals (1) (5) (6). Like other <em>Rhinopithecus</em> species the grey snub-nosed monkey has also been hunted for food and traditional medicine and local people are often unaware of the laws protecting these species (6).,The grey snub-nosed monkey is found in the protected Fanjingshan Nature Reserve (1) (6) with only one small group known to move outside of this area (1) (5). The grey snub-nosed monkey is listed on Appendix I of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) which means that international trade in this species is permitted only in exceptional circumstances (4). The species is also listed as Category I under the Chinese Wildlife Protection Act of 1989 (1).,,,,,,Busardo DorsigrÌ_s, GavilÌÁn Dorsigris,Grey-backed hawk ,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Falconiformes,Accipitridae,Leucopternis (1),Length: 45 - 48 cm (2),The forests of western Ecuador are considered to be one of the world\u2019s most threatened ecosystems and as a result of logging and clearance for agriculture over 90 percent is now deforested. The impact of this habitat destruction on grey-backed hawk populations has undoubtedly been severe. As western Ecuador becomes increasingly developed and road networks expand the pressure on this species and its habitat will only increase. Even in the areas where the grey-backed hawk is protected such as the Mache-Chindul Ecological Reserve illegal logging and hunting are common (2) and other activities that are detrimental to the bird\u2019s habitat such as livestock grazing have been allowed to continue (6).,Although enforcement is severely lacking populations of the grey-backed hawk residing within conservation areas such as Machalilla National Park and Mache-Chindul Ecological Reserve in Ecuador and Tumbes Reserved Zone (a part of the Northwest Peru Biosphere Reserve) in Peru do at least receive a modicum of protection (2).,,,,,,,,,ColibrÌ_ VentigrÌ_s,Grey-bellied comet ,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Apodiformes,Trochilidae,Taphrolesbia (1),Taphrolesbia (1),[],[],,,,,,,,,,Psittacus pyrrhopterus,Grey-cheeked parakeet ,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Psittaciformes,Psittacidae,Brotogeris (1),60 ‰ÛÒ 68 g (3),This bird was once abundant but is now only locally common with as few as 15000 individuals remaining whilst over 59000 grey-cheeked parakeets have been reported to have passed through international trade checkpoints. In fact the caged-bird trade is the greatest threat to the species with unsustainably high numbers of birds being trapped and removed from the wild. The grey-cheeked parakeet is listed on Appendix II of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species but this does not regulate internal trade or trapping within Ecuador and Peru (3).,International trade in this species is banned in both Ecuador and Peru. It occurs in several protected areas of which Cerro Blanco Protection Forest Ecuador and Tumbes Reserved Zone Peru are particularly important and regular population monitoring takes place. The timing of the breeding season has yet to be established and research will contribute positively to any conservation efforts. Strict bans on collection of the grey-cheeked parakeet and conservation education programmes may prove to be the key to the continuation of this species (2).,,,,,,,,,,Gray-headed warbler,Grey-headed warbler ,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Parulidae,Basileuterus (1),Adult length: 14 cm (2),The main threat to the grey-headed warbler is habitat destruction. Large areas of the Cordillera de Caripe have been cleared for agriculture and pasture. Forest clearing and burning for coffee and fruit plantations are degrading the <strong>montane forest</strong> habitat reducing the available understory on which the grey-headed warbler depends for survival (3).,Large areas of the grey-headed warbler\u2019s habitat are protected within El Gu\xe1charo National Park and the reserve was recently expanded to include a further 500 square\xa0kilometres of largely undisturbed forest. Increasing the area of protected habitat further will help protect the grey-headed warbler (3).,,,,,,,,,,Java leaf monkey, Javan grizzled langur, Javan surili,Grizzled leaf monkey ,Animalia,Chordata,Mammalia,Primates,Cercopithecidae,Presbytis (1),Male weight: 6710 g (2)Female weight: 6680 g (2),Habitat loss is the main threat to the grizzled leaf monkey with the clearance of Indonesian rainforests resulting in less than four percent of the grizzled leaf monkey\u2019s natural habitat remaining (12). This combined with the continuous threat of hunting has resulted in a 50 percent drop in grizzled leaf monkey numbers in the last decade (12) and it was estimated in 1996 that less than 2500 mature individuals remain in their natural habitat (1).,Remaining populations of the grizzled leaf monkey occur in a number of protected areas in western Java including Ujung Kulon National Park Halimun National Park and Gede-Pangrango National Park which will hopefully offer some protection from habitat disturbance and hunting (1). It is also listed on Appendix II of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) which means that any international trade in this species should be carefully monitored (3).,,,,,,,,Big-billed bunting, Wilkins's bunting, Wilkins's finch,Grosbeak bunting ,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Emberizidae,Nesospiza (1),Nesospiza (1),[],[],,,,,,,,Eleutherodactylus insignitus,Ground robber frog ,Animalia,Chordata,Amphibia,Anura,Strabomantidae,Pristimantis (1),Pristimantis (1),[],[],,,,,,,,,,Cedros Island pine, insignis pine, radiata pine,Guadalupe Island pine ,Plantae,Tracheophyta,Coniferopsida,Coniferales,Pinaceae,Pinus (1),Pinus (1),[],[],,,,,,,,Black howler monkey, Central American black howler, Guatemalan black howler monkey, Guatemalan howler, Guatemalan howling monkey, Mexican black howler monkey,Guatemalan black howler ,Animalia,Chordata,Mammalia,Primates,Atelidae,Alouatta (1),Male head-and-body length: 67åÊ- 71 cm (2)Female head-and-body length: 52åÊ- 64 cm (2)Male tail length: 60åÊ- 67 cm (2)Female tail length: 50åÊ- 54 cm (2)Male weight: c. 11.4 kg (2)Female weight: c. 6.4 kg (2),The Guatemalan black howler is threatened throughout most of its range from hunting and habitat destruction (10). Suitable forest habitat has rapidly been lost and fragmented through conversion to pasture and agricultural lands and to logging operations (8). If such patterns continue the population size of this species is projected to decline by around 74% over three generations (30 years) (1).,The Guatemalan black howler is known to occur in six protected areas: Cockscomb Basin Wildlife Sanctuary Guanacaste and Monkey Bay National Parks (Belize); Rio Dulce and Tikal National Parks (Guatemala); and Palenque National Park (Mexico) (2).,,,,,Abeto de Guatemala, Pashaque, Pinabere, Romerillo,Guatemalan fir ,Plantae,Tracheophyta,Coniferopsida,Coniferales,Pinaceae,Abies (1),Abies (1),[],[],,,,,,,paleate spiny-tailed iguana,Guatemalan spiny-tailed iguana ,Animalia,Chordata,Reptilia,Squamata,Iguanidae,Ctenosaura (1),Male total length: up to 61 cm (2)Female total length: up to 51 cm (2),In the past the Guatemalan spiny-tailed iguana has been heavily hunted for both food and the international pet trade (2). Collection for the pet trade continues today but is not believed to pose such as serious threat as habitat loss (1). The conversion of forest habitat into agricultural land is the greatest threat to the survival of the Guatemalan spiny-tailed iguana (1) (7); the impacts of which are exacerbated by this species\u2019 restricted distribution. (1).,The Guatemalan spiny-tailed iguana does not currently receive any legal protection and is not known to occur within any protected areas and thus action to prevent its extinction in the wild is clearly urgently needed (1). In 2007 the International Iguana Foundation initiated a campaign to raise funds for an Iguana Specialist Group workshop aimed at the spiny-tailed iguanas and to implement recommended conservation actions that arise from that workshop (7). Captive populations of the Guatemalan spiny-tailed iguana exist in several zoos around the world (1) which may act as an insurance against this species\u2019 entire extinction yet this does not lessen how devastating it would be to lose this armoured reptile from the wild.,,,,,,,,,,Hyla salvadorensis,Guerreran stream frog ,Animalia,Chordata,Amphibia,Anura,Hylidae,Ptychohyla (1),Ptychohyla (1),[],[],,,,,,,,,,Gephyromantis elegans, Spinomantis guibei,Guibes Madagascar frog ,Animalia,Chordata,Amphibia,Anura,Mantellidae,Mantidactylus (1),Mantidactylus (1),[],[],,,,,,,,,Schoutedenella crusculum,Guinea screeching frog ,Animalia,Chordata,Amphibia,Anura,Arthroleptidae,Arthroleptis (1),Arthroleptis (1),[],[],,,,,,,,,,baya grouper,Gulf grouper ,Animalia,Chordata,Actinopterygii,Perciformes,Serranidae,Mycteroperca (1),up to 91 kg (2),The Gulf grouper\u2019s large size has made it a popular target for recreational fishing and for local fisheries and the species is also caught as <strong>bycatch</strong> by shrimp trawlers in the Gulf of California (1) (2). However as with many groupers the long life span slow growth late maturity and unusual life history of the Gulf grouper together with its small geographical range and its tendency to come together in large <strong>spawning</strong> aggregations all increase its vulnerability to overfishing (1) (6) (7) (8). The population of this once abundant fish is believed to have declined severely more than halving in the last 30 years (1) (6) and even more alarmingly may have declined by over 99 percent since the 1940s (1). In the Gulf of Mexico the sex ratio of the population is currently skewed with significantly fewer males than females. Sadly increased coastal development in the northern Gulf of California and greater investment in recreational fisheries look set to increase reef habitat destruction and intensify fishing pressure on the Gulf grouper in the future (1).,The Gulf grouper occurs in a few protected areas throughout its range including within the Alto Golfo Biosphere Reserve although enforcement in this area is lacking (1). There are no specific conservation measures known to be directly targeted at this large reef fish although there have been calls to protect and manage the <strong>spawning</strong> aggregations of groupers and other reef fish (7) (8) a measure which may also help to protect this vulnerable species.,,,,,,,,,,Amblysomus gunningi,Gunning‰Ûªs golden mole ,Animalia,Chordata,Mammalia,Afrosoricida,Chrysochloridae,Neamblysomus (1) (2),Male head-body length: 12.1 ‰ÛÒ 13.2 cm (3)Female head-body length: 11.1 ‰ÛÒ 12.8 cm (3)Male weight: 56 ‰ÛÒ 70 g (3)Female weight: 39 ‰ÛÒ 56 g (3),Gunning\u2019s golden mole only occurs at a few locations within a very small range and consequently is highly vulnerable to any detrimental human-induced activities within this area. The species occurs in a number of state owned forests; however the management of these areas does not necessarily take into consideration the management of this <strong>subterranean</strong> mammal. The potential for some of these forests to be sold to private ownership and commercial forestry operations also means that this species could become even more threatened (1) (9). Several farms in the vicinity of Magoebaskloof are earmarked for housing development that will further fragment its already restricted distribution (10).,There are no specific conservation measures in place for Gunning\u2019s golden mole but it is known to occur in the De Hoek New Agatha and Woodbush Forest Reserves. To implement appropriate conservation measures further research is needed to clarify the uncertainty surrounding the distribution of this species and to further assess the relative importance of the various threats it faces. In addition raising public awareness of the mere existence of this highly elusive species and its important ecological role as insect-eating small mammal is of cardinal importance for the continued survival and conservation for future generations (3) (9).,,,,,,,,,,Centrocercus urophasianus,Gunnison sage-grouse ,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Galliformes,Phasianidae,Centrocercus (1),Centrocercus (1),[],[],,,,,,,,,,Philautus microtympanum, Polypedates microtympanum,Gunther's bubble-nest frog ,Animalia,Chordata,Amphibia,Anura,Rhacophoridae,Pseudophilautus (1),Pseudophilautus (1),[],[],,,,,,,,,Black-breasted pitta,Gurney‰Ûªs pitta ,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Pittidae,Pitta (1),0.10 - 0.11 kg (2),The main cause of the decline of\xa0Gurney's pitta\xa0was the massive deforestation that has occurred in peninsular Thailand. By the middle of the 1980s just 4.7 percent of the original forest cover remained (4). Hunting disturbance by humans and trade are also believed to have played a part in the decline (4). Deforestation continued illegally in Thailand throughout the 1990s and several Gurney\u2019s pitta <strong>territories</strong> were destroyed as a result (4).,A wildlife sanctuary was established in 1993 but much of the habitat of Gurney's pitta was excluded. In 1990 the Khao Nor Chuchi Lowland Forest project was established this is a socio-economic community-level conservation and development project the aims of which are diverse. Achievements include the creation of more wildlife friendly areas amongst a mosaic of cultivation tree planting supporting forest protection workers and promoting sustainable agriculture (4). However difficulties have plagued the project. It is clear that unless drastic action is taken and the crucial 30 kilometre squared area of suitable habitat is completely protected soon this species will become extinct (4).,,,,,,,,,,CucarrÌ_n, CucharÌ_n,Gyranthera ,Plantae,Tracheophyta,Magnoliopsida,Malvales,Bombacaceae,Gyranthera (1),Gyranthera (1),[],[],,,,,,,,,Malabar Indian frog, rufous leaf-hopper frog,GÌ_nther‰Ûªs frog ,Animalia,Chordata,Amphibia,Anura,Ranidae,Indirana (1),Indirana (1),[],[],,,,,,,,,Hatinh langur, stripe-headed black langur,Ha Tinh langur ,Animalia,Chordata,Mammalia,Primates,Cercopithecidae,Trachypithecus (1),Trachypithecus (1),[],[],,,,,,,,,Parapelophryne scalptus, Pelophryne scalptus,Hainan flathead toad ,Animalia,Chordata,Amphibia,Anura,Bufonidae,Parapelophryne (1),Parapelophryne (1),[],[],,,,,,,,,Neohylomys hainanensis,Hainan gymnure ,Animalia,Chordata,Mammalia,Erinaceomorpha,Erinaceidae,Hylomys (1),50 ‰ÛÒ 69 g (2),The preferred habitat of the Hainan gymnure evergreen forest is under considerable pressure from clearance for timber and the expansion of agriculture (2).,Although the Hainan gymnure is poorly known the rate of habitat loss on Hainan Island is great enough to raise serious concern for this species\u2019 survival.

A single otter pelt may fetch up to $200 an attractive reward to many hunters who often live in economically poor areas and the hairy-nosed otter may also be hunted for its meat with hunting still particularly rampant in Tonle Sap Lake and the Mekong Delta (5) (10). As a result of this hunting otter populations across Southeast Asia have undergone substantial declines (1) (14).,The hairy-nosed otter is protected by law in all of its range states and is also listed on Appendix II of the Convention on the International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) which should ensure that international trade is monitored (1) (4). Its habitat is also protected in some areas by the RAMSAR Convention and the Convention on Biological Diversity and it is found in a number of protected areas (1) (10). In reality however this species has received little protection mainly because of a lack of law enforcement at the local level and hunting and habitat loss has continued to threaten this Endangered species (3) (10). In addition to improved law enforcement this species would also benefit from further studies into its ecology and further surveys in areas which could potentially support populations such as the Irrawaddy Delta as information on its distribution is limited while there is no such information on its population (3) (6).\xa0 \xa0,,,,,,,,,,Elattoneura khalidi,Hajar Wadi damsel ,Animalia,Arthropoda,Insecta,Odonata,Protoneuridae,Arabineura (1),Arabineura (1),Although little is known about the Hajar Wadi damsel it is likely to be threatened by the degradation and loss of its breeding habitat through pollution over-irrigation and drainage (1) (4). These problems are likely to worsen as the human population in the region expands (1). Drying out of its habitat is also a serious threat and is expected to increase in the future as a result of global climate change (1).,The conservation of the Hajar Wadi damsel will require ongoing management of good quality running waters (1) as well as measures to combat water pollution and the protection of suitable habitats (4). Research priorities for the damselflies and dragonflies of this region include further <strong>taxonomic</strong> assessments a complete identification key for all species and regular monitoring of the status and habitat use of <strong>endemic</strong> limited range species such as the Hajar Wadi damsel (4).,,,,,,,,,,Brown New Zealand frog, Stephens Island frog,Hamilton‰Ûªs frog ,Animalia,Chordata,Amphibia,Anura,Leiopelmatidae,Leiopelma (1),Leiopelma (1),[],[],,,,,,,,,Sapo Limosa,Harlequin frog ,Animalia,Chordata,Amphibia,Anura,Bufonidae,Atelopus (1),Atelopus (1),[],[],,,,,,,,,,Koloa maoli,Hawaiian duck ,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Anseriformes,Anatidae,Anas (1),461 - 605 g (3),By the mid 20th century the combined impacts of predation by non-native animals habitat loss for agriculture and urban development and over-hunting decimated the once abundant Hawaiian duck to around 530 individuals (2). Fortunately with protection and prohibition of hunting the population recovered to around 2000 at the beginning of this century (2) (5) (6). However today a much more subtle dynamic presents the greatest threat to the species survival. Non-native mallards were first introduced to Hawaii for ornamental ponds and farming in the 1800s and in the 1950s and 1960s hundreds were imported to stock hunting areas. Since then cross-breeding between the two closely related species has had a dramatic influence on the number of pure Hawaiian ducks particularly on Oahu and Maui. Furthermore it is now suspected that even the core populations on Kauai and Niihau contain hybrids (2) (5). In addition to <strong>hybridisation</strong> several other more conspicuous threats continue to have an impact on this species including predation by introduced mammals habitat loss wetland modification by alien plants and human disturbance (2).,The establishment of several State and Federal wildlife sanctuaries in conjunction with legal protection under endangered species laws and a program of re-introductions of captive bred birds was instrumental in the recovery of the Hawaiian duck population during the latter half of the 20th century (2) (4) (6). In the late 1980s a ban was placed on the importation of mallards except for research and exhibition and was followed in 2002 by the implementation of restrictive import regulations on all birds shipped to the islands to protect the public from West Nile Virus (2) (5). Even so the mallard continues to reproduce on the islands and is still sold commercially (5). The priority therefore is to control populations of mallards and <strong>hybrids</strong> to prevent irreversible genetic swamping of the Hawaiian duck populations (2). This is to be achieved via a three-pronged approach involving public outreach humane removal of feral mallards and hybrids and stronger regulatory controls on non-native potentially harmful ducks (4). Already underway is an outreach and communications plan and field key for differentiating pure birds from <strong>hybrids</strong> (4) (5).,,,,,,,,,,New Zealand dolphin, white-headed dolphin,Hector's dolphin ,Animalia,Chordata,Mammalia,Cetartiodactyla,Delphinidae,Cephalorhynchus (1),40 - 60 kg (2),Currently the major threat to the survival of this species is <strong>bycatch</strong> by commercial and recreational fishers particularly entanglements in gillnets which is reported to occur throughout the range (1) (6) (9). Due to the coastal habitat of Hector's dolphin the species is vulnerable to a large number of other threats such as pollution vessel traffic and habitat modification as well as fisheries <strong>bycatch</strong> (1).,The New Zealand Marine Mammals Protection Act has made the deliberate killing or injury of marine mammals illegal (1). Under this act the Department of Conservation designated the Banks Peninsula Marine Mammal Sanctuary in 1988 effectively prohibiting commercial gillnetting and restricting recreational gillnetting. A second protected area was designated on the west coast of the North Island in 2003. These were surpassed by new Ministry of Fisheries regulations in 2008 which ban gillnetting to four nautical miles off the majority of the South Island\u2019s east and south coasts regulate gillnetting on the South Island\u2019s west coast to two nautical miles (3.7 kilometres) offshore and extend the gillnet ban on the North Island\u2019s west coast to seven nautical miles (13 kilometres) offshore. Five marine mammal sanctuaries were designated around the coastline in 2008 to provide additional protection from non-fisheries related impacts (13).,,,,,,,,,Bulbophyllum scandens,Hederorkis ,Plantae,Tracheophyta,Liliopsida,Orchidales,Orchidaceae,Hederorkis (1),Hederorkis (1),[],[],,,,,,,,,,Hedrick‰Ûªs coqui, treehole coqui,Hedrick‰Ûªs robber frog ,Animalia,Chordata,Amphibia,Anura,Leptodactylidae,Eleutherodactylus (1),Eleutherodactylus (1),[],[],,,,,,,,,Falcate Yellowwood,Henkel's Yellowwood ,Plantae,Tracheophyta,Liliopsida,Orchidales,Orchidaceae,Podocarpus (1),Podocarpus (1),[],[],,,,,,,,,,Eleutherodactylus hernandezi,Hernandez's robber frog ,Animalia,Chordata,Amphibia,Anura,Strabomantidae,Pristimantis (1),Pristimantis (1),[],[],,,,,,,,,,Neuragrion mysticum,Heteropodagrion ,Animalia,Arthropoda,Insecta,Odonata,Megapodagrionidae,Heteropodagrion (1),Heteropodagrion (1),[],[],,,,,,,,,,Eleutherodactylus prolatus,Hidden robber frog ,Animalia,Chordata,Amphibia,Anura,Strabomantidae,Pristimantis (1),Pristimantis (1),[],[],,,,,,,,,,Patricia‰Ûªs robber frog,High mountain eleuth ,Animalia,Chordata,Amphibia,Anura,Leptodactylidae,Eleutherodactylus (1),Eleutherodactylus (1),[],[],,,,,,,,,,Himalayan muskdeer, Himalayan musk-deer,Himalayan musk deer ,Animalia,Chordata,Mammalia,Cetartiodactyla,Moschidae,Moschus (1),13 ‰ÛÒ 18 kg (2),The primary threat to the Himalayan musk deer is hunting for musk a highly-desired product has been used in perfumes and traditional medicines for over 5000 years (1) (9) (10). Although it is no longer in such demand due to the availability of cheaper synthetics it is still found in as many as 400 Chinese and Korean medicines and may sell for as much as $45000 per kilogram making it one of the most valuable animal-derived products in the world (4) (10). As a result of its high value and the poor economic state of many communities within its range hunting of the Himalayan musk deer has been unsustainable (1) (11). Animals are indiscriminately caught using snares and although only adult males produce musk both females and juveniles are also caught with between three and five deer killed per harvested musk pod. In some regions the Himalayan musk deer may also be hunted for its meat while its habitat is threatened by encroaching pastoral farming (1) (11). \xa0,The Himalayan musk deer is protected by law in Bhutan Nepal and India. In China hunting may be permitted in some areas although a license is required. This Endangered species is also found in a number of protected areas; however the uneven enforcement of legislation across its range has meant there has been little impact on preventing the rampant trade in the species (11). Improving the enforcement of anti-poaching laws is deemed a key priority for the conservation of this species (1).\xa0,,,,,,,,,Taxus yunnanensis,Himalayan yew ,Plantae,Tracheophyta,Coniferopsida,Coniferales,Taxaceae,Taxus (1),Taxus (1),[],[],,,,,,,,,,Haitian solenodon,Hispaniolan solenodon ,Animalia,Chordata,Mammalia,Soricomorpha,Solenodontidae,Solenodon (1),700 ‰ÛÒ 1000 g (2),Out of approximately 25 <strong>endemic</strong> land (non-flying) mammal species that once inhabited Hispaniola only two survive to this day: the solenodon and hutia (3) (7).\xa0 Before Europeans arrived on the island the Hispaniolan solenodon was one of the dominant <strong>carnivores</strong> on Hispaniola (1) (2) despite some evidence that suggests that the original occupants of Hispaniola (Amerindians) hunted this species for food (3) (7).\xa0 Today however the solenodon is thought to be threatened by predation from introduced cats dogs and mongooses brought to the island with the arrival of the Europeans (1) (2).\xa0 Even back in 1907 when a Mr Verill attempted to find the solenodon in the Dominican Republic he attributed its restricted range to the presence of the mongoose and felt that it was only a question of time before the mongoose would cause the solenodon\u2019s extinction (5).\xa0 The destruction of forests on the island also poses a significant threat to the solenodon an animal which is particularly vulnerable to any negative impact due to its low reproductive rate (1) (2).\xa0,There is thought to be little hope for this species in Haiti (2) but in the Dominican Republic the Hispaniolan solenodon is known to occur in several areas (6).\xa0 These areas still face threats from logging agriculture and cattle ranching; however both international conservation organisations (for example The Nature Conservancy and Durrell Wildlife Conservation Trust) and national conservation organisations (for example Sociedad Ornitologica de la Hispaniola and Grupo Jaragua) are working to address these threats and implement management plans for protected areas (6). \xa0The focus of efforts should be to conserve this species in protected forest reserves; however the enormous pressure from increasing human populations on Hispaniola may mean that the survival of the Hispaniolan solenodon ultimately depends on zoos (2) although as yet captive breeding of this unique mammal has not been successful (7).,,,,,,,,,,Assam rabbit,Hispid hare ,Animalia,Chordata,Mammalia,Lagomorpha,Leporidae,Caprolagus (1),c. 2.5 kg (4),The hispid hare is restricted to small isolated fragments of habitat across much of its range largely due to habitat destruction for agriculture and human settlement the annual cutting and burning of grassland and overgrazing (6).,The hispid hare is listed on Appendix I of the Convention of International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) meaning that trade in this species in prohibited (5). It is also listed on Schedule 1 of the Indian Wildlife Protection Act 1972 and on Schedule 1 of the National Parks and Wildlife Conservation Measures Act 1973 in Nepal (1). The Royal Suklaphanta Wildlife Reserve in Nepal which holds the largest breeding population of the hispid hare is a protected area (7).,,,,,,,,,,Indochinese hog deer, Thai hog deer,Hog deer ,Animalia,Chordata,Mammalia,Cetartiodactyla,Cervidae,Axis (1),36 ‰ÛÒ 45 kg (2),Over the last 20 years or so the increasingly rare hog deer is believed to have suffered a decline of as much as 50 percent. This decline has been highest in the eastern parts of its range where it is suspected to have undergone at least a 90 percent decrease. The hog deer is now one of the most threatened large mammals in Indochina and is believed to be extinct in Laos Vietnam Thailand and most of Cambodia. Furthermore it is believed extinct in China and most of Bangladesh. In India and Nepal outside of protected areas few viable populations remain and severe hunting pressure exists (1).,A rare and vulnerable species the hog deer is in drastic need of critical conservation measures. Recognising this every country within the species\u2019 range has afforded the hog deer full protection from hunting (1). The relict Indochinese population in Kratie Cambodia has received extra protection and the WWF Greater Mekong Programme supports a number of rangers that patrol the area deterring hunters. WWF has also begun community education and ecotourism programmes that aim to highlight the plight of this vulnerable population (5) (10). Furthermore Global Wildlife Conservation is developing plans to protect the newly discovered population in Botum-Sakor National Park southwest Cambodia although the total population size is unknown (6). The hog deer is also found in a number of protected areas including some of the most secure reserves in the world such as the Corbett Tiger Reserve in India. It has also indirectly benefited from the conservation of the Indian rhinoceros (<em>Rhinoceros unicornis</em>) with which it co-exists in wet grasslands. However many reserves are not big enough to allow seasonal movements and the level of legal enforcement received varies (1).\xa0,,,,,,,,,Hoge‰Ûªs toadhead turtle, Hoge's sideneck turtle,Hoge‰Ûªs side-necked turtle ,Animalia,Chordata,Reptilia,Testudines,Chelidae,Mesoclemmys (1),Mesoclemmys (1),[],[],,,,,,,,,GuayacÌÁn, GuayacÌÁn Real,Holywood lignum vitae ,Plantae,Tracheophyta,Magnoliopsida,Sapindales,Zygophyllaceae,Guaiacum (1),Height: up to 10 m (3) (4),The main threat the holywood lignum vitae faces is over harvesting. The tree is sought after for both its high quality timber and medicinal resin which are of commercial value and have been traded for several centuries (1) (4) This has led to intense logging making it extremely rare across its entire range (1) and close to local extinction in 11 countries (8). The holywood lignum vitae was previously found in El Salvador but has now gone regionally extinct there (1) (4). Regeneration of the holywood lignum vitae is being encouraged but due to the slow growth rate of this species progress is slow (1).,The holywood lignum vitae is included on the convention on the\xa0Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) Appendix II regulates its international trade (2). There has been recent consideration of it being re-categorised to CITES Appendix I making international trade of wild trees illegal (4). This species is also found in some protected areas. For example in Mexico the holywood lignum vitae is protected at ten sites with the majority of the area protected being located in the Calakmul region in Campeche (8).,,,,,,,,,Amazilia HondureÌ±a, Esmeralda Hondurena,Honduran emerald ,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Apodiformes,Trochilidae,Amazilia (1),Head-body length: 9 ‰ÛÒ 10 cm (2),As the Honduran emerald is restricted to dry thorn-forests its survival is dependant upon the prevalence of this habitat. Unfortunately dry thorn-forests are the most endangered ecosystem in Honduras and have been reduced by a drastic 90 percent. Vast areas of thorn-forest have been converted to rice and pineapple plantations and cattle pastures while urbanisation and agriculture continue to encroach upon the Honduran emerald\u2019s habitat\xa0 (5) (6). In the R\xedo Agu\xe1n valley only 84 square kilometres of suitable Honduran emerald habitat remains while in the Agalta valley there is less than one square kilometre. Furthermore much of the remaining habitat is privately owned for cattle grazing and receives no form of protection. Consequently the population of the Honduran emerald is now critically small and it is considered the rarest bird in Central America and one of the most endangered birds in the world (4) (5) (8) (9).\xa0,In Honduras a small poor country with a rapidly growing economy conservation is a major challenge (6). However the American Bird Conservancy is working to ensure the rare Honduran emerald is afforded increased protection through the acquisition of 30 square kilometres of suitable habitat (4) (5). The Fundaci\xf3n Pico Bonito a Honduran conservation organisation has also successfully secured funding from the World Bank to invest in habitat protection and to mitigate the effects of planned road constructions (6). The Honduran emerald will also benefit from numerous other proposed measures including the extension of the Sierra de Agalta National Park to encompass the species\u2019 range the establishment of a network of protected areas and further studies into the species\u2019 ecology (5) (6) (9). It is also hoped that promoting the Critically Endangered Honduran emerald as a symbol of national conservation will highlight its plight and educate local people of the value of conservation (6).\xa0 \xa0\xa0\xa0,,,,,,,,,Loveridge's anole,Honduran giant anole ,Animalia,Chordata,Reptilia,Squamata,Polychrotidae,Anolis (1),Anolis (1),[],[],,,,,,,,,,AguÌÁn Valley iguana, black-chested spiny-tailed iguana, Cayos Cochinos iguana, Rio AguÌÁn iguana,Honduran paleate spiny-tailed iguana ,Animalia,Chordata,Reptilia,Squamata,Iguanidae,Ctenosaura (1),Ctenosaura (1),Habitat loss and degradation mainly due to conversion for agriculture and cattle grazing are the primary reasons for the extreme rarity of the Honduran paleate spiny-tailed iguana (1). It is also hunted for its meat skin and eggs and is collected for the exotic pet trade where like all <em>Ctenosaura</em> species it is in high demand (1) (6).,Relatively little is currently known about the Honduran paleate spiny-tailed iguana so further knowledge of this species is imperative if conservation efforts are to be successful. A project funded by the International Iguana Foundation was initiated in 2008 to develop accurate estimates of population size and distribution (7) which will allow for more effective conservation management of this distinctive reptile. The project includes the involvement of local people which helps to raise awareness of this iguana\u2019s importance and will be a key part in the survival of this species (7).,,,,,,,PercnoptÌ¬re brun,Hooded vulture ,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Falconiformes,Accipitridae,Necrosyrtes (1),Necrosyrtes (1),[],[],,,,,,,,,,Sinai cat snake,Hoogstraal‰Ûªs cat snake ,Animalia,Chordata,Reptilia,Squamata,Colubridae,Telescopus (1),Total length: up to 102 cm (2),The main threat facing Hoogstraal\u2019s cat snake is its fragmented distribution which makes it intrinsically more vulnerable to extinction (1). Populations of Hoogstraal\u2019s cat snake are in decline in Egypt because its habitat is being destroyed and the habitat quality is decreasing. Human activities that are reducing its habitat include overgrazing by livestock quarrying firewood harvesting and over-collection by scientists. This species is also sometimes killed on roads (1).,There are not known to be any specific conservation measures currently targeted at Hoogstraal\u2019s cat snake. However this poorly known reptile occurs in Dana Wildlife Reserve in Jordan and in another reserve in part of Sinai Egypt which may offer it some protection (1).,,,,,,,,,,Guan Cornudo, PaujÌ_ Cornudo, PavÌ_n, PavÌ_n Cornudo,Horned guan ,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Galliformes,Cracidae,Oreophasis (1),Length: 81 - 91 cm (2),Extensive deforestation for logging the gathering of firewood and for agricultural expansion has occurred in the lush forests where these birds are found (4). Habitat loss is consequently the greatest threat to the survival of this species and the development of new roads allows ever-more pristine forest to be exploited (4).,The horned guan is protected in both Guatemala and Mexico and international trade in the species is prohibited by its listing on Appendix I of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) (3). A small number of individuals have been bred in captivity and many populations are located within reserves. Despite these measures however the number of individuals is estimated to be fewer than 2500 and appears to be declining (4).,,,,,,,Eleutherodactylus tenebrionis,Hotel robber frog ,Animalia,Chordata,Amphibia,Anura,Strabomantidae,Pristimantis (1),Pristimantis (1),[],[],,,,,,,,,,Chilean guemal, Chilean huemul, Patagonian Huemul., South Andean deer, South Andean huemul,Huemul ,Animalia,Chordata,Mammalia,Cetartiodactyla,Cervidae,Hippocamelus (1),40 ‰ÛÒ 100 kg (3),Huemul were previously hunted by Native American Indians but rarely and mainly for their skins as they are much smaller and less abundant than the guanaco (<i>Lama guanicoe</i>) the only other native <strong>ungulate</strong> in the region (2) (3). Poaching is still a major threat to this species even though hunting is now illegal. Other threats include predation by pumas foxes and domestic dogs habitat destruction fires and livestock ranching.  Locally over-grazing construction and recreational activities may prove detrimental to the huemul (2) (3). In addition large areas of forest have been harvested and replaced by agriculture and exotic tree forestry operations (2) resulting in huemul populations becoming isolated and therefore more vulnerable to local extinction (6).,An estimated 1000 to 2000 individuals survive today (2006) and this number is thought to be declining (3) (7).  Several projects are in progress surveying the range and population of the huemul. Two large non-governmental organisations in Argentina and Chile are working together to survey the border areas that are home to this species; however this is difficult due to the rugged terrain of the region (2).,,,,,,Giant wrasse, humphead, Maori wrasse, Napoleon wrasse, truck wrasse, undulate wrasse,Humphead wrasse ,Animalia,Chordata,Actinopterygii,Perciformes,Labridae,Cheilinus (1),up to 191 kg (2),Although the humphead wrasse has a widespread distribution it has never been common in its range and recent reports have revealed a worrying decline in numbers. Its life history characteristics make this species extremely vulnerable to exploitation and the population can only sustain light levels of fishing (4). Traditionally the flesh of this fish has been highly prized and more recently this species has become one of the most highly sought species of the Live Reef Food Fish Trade (LRFFT) a luxury food industry that has undergone an increase in popularity in many eastern Asian countries (4). Humphead wrasse can fetch up to US $100 per kilogram at retail in Hong Kong (4) and as their numbers dwindle the rarity of the species is likely to increase the price (4). Cyanide is typically used to catch fish for this trade because live fish are difficult to take any other way; a practice that devastates coral reefs (4).,Little is known of the biology and distribution of the humphead wrasse and more data are urgently needed to understand the scale of the threats faced by current populations and to implement effective conservation programmes (4). The World Conservation Union's (IUCN) Groupers and Wrasses Specialist Group is working to collect this all-important data and to raise awareness of the issues involved throughout the region (4). The species is partially protected in areas of Australia the Philippines the Maldives and Palau and was proposed for inclusion in Appendix II of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) in November 2002 (4). Trade restrictions are particularly important as this species cannot be hatchery reared and all individuals in trade come from wild populations (5).,,,,,Matschie‰Ûªs tree-kangaroo,Huon tree kangaroo ,Animalia,Chordata,Mammalia,Diprotodontia,Macropodidae,Dendrolagus (1),6 ‰ÛÒ 13 kg (3),These tree kangaroos are threatened by hunting and habitat destruction from logging mining and oil operations (4) (5). Hunting pressure is high in many of the remaining forested areas with Huon tree kangaroos hunted primarily by natives of Papua New Guinea for their succulent meat. Although traditionally hunted by people with dingoes which had relatively little impact on populations the introduction of guns to the island has dramatically increased the numbers that can be caught and severely jeopardised the future of this species (2).,The main focus of conservation efforts for this species has been on captive-breeding programmes with individuals held at a number of zoos worldwide (2). Woodland Park Zoo in Seattle is a leader in captive breeding and reproduction research on the Huon tree kangaroo being the first to recognize the importance of isolating females after mating to reduce stress on the mother and increase infant survival rates (5). A Species Survival Plan has also been developed by international zoos for this species which focuses on field studies and preserving the species\u2019 natural habitat whilst at the same time maintaining and studying a large captive population and stressing the need for education on the detrimental effects of forest destruction and hunting (3). It is vital that such education awareness campaigns are directed towards local people and government officials alike if the decline of this beautiful unusual species is to be halted.,,,,,,,,,,Guacamayo Azul, Guacamayo Jacinto,Hyacinth macaw ,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Psittaciformes,Psittacidae,Anodorhynchus (1),Length: 100 cm (2),Hyacinth macaw numbers are in decline as a result of habitat loss and over-collection for the illegal pet trade. In the 1980s it is estimated that at least 10000 birds were taken from the wild (2). Throughout the macaw\u2019s range habitat is being lost or altered due to the introduction of cattle ranching and mechanised agriculture and the development of hydroelectric schemes (2).,The hyacinth macaw is protected by law in Brazil and international trade is prohibited by its listing on Appendix I of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) (2). There are a number of long-term studies and conservation initiatives in place; the Hyacinth Macaw Project in the Brazilian State of Mato Grosso do Sul has carried out important research by ringing individual birds and has created a number of artificial nests to compensate for the small percentage of sites available in the region (5). The effective enforcement of protection laws is required if this beautiful parrot is going to be saved from the fate of the other Brazilian parrots Lear's (<i>Anodorhynchus leari</i>) and Spix's macaw (<i>Cyanopsitta spixii</i>) which now teeter on the brink of extinction.,,,,,,,,,Chapa,Iberus ,Animalia,Mollusca,Gastropoda,Stylommatophora,Helicidae,Iberus (1),Iberus (1),[],[],,,,,,,,,,imperial parrot, sisserou,Imperial Amazon ,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Psittaciformes,Psittacidae,Amazona (1),Length: 45 cm (2),The precipitous decline of this species known to number just 80-100 individuals in 1993 was the result of a combination of factors including habitat loss caused by conversion of forests to plantations and hurricane damage as well as hunting for food and trapping for the pet trade (2). Subsistence hunting was prevalent throughout the mid to late 1940s and the species continued to be hunted for the pet trade into the 1980s (8). Thankfully strict law enforcement a comprehensive education and awareness campaign and national pride have all but eliminated threats from poaching since the early 1990\u2019s (2) (7). Despite an increase in numbers the population remains low with estimates of between 150 and 250 adults remaining (4) (8) and the species is therefore still classified as Endangered by the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species (1). Habitat loss still poses a serious threat however and as lowland forests are increasingly cleared the imperial Amazon may face competition for nest sites with the related species <i>Amazonia arausiaca</i> (2).,The imperial Amazon has benefited from Dominica\u2019s long history of forest conservation and more recently from intensive governmental and non-governmental efforts to protect its habitat and make local citizens aware of its needs (8). Indeed it is as a result of a dedicated conservation programme targeted at the imperial Amazon spearheaded by the partnership between Dominica\u2019s Forestry Wildlife and Parks Division and the Rare Species Conservatory Foundation (RSCF) (8) that numbers of this species have slowly increased. To date this partnership has significantly aided this endangered parrot through integrating extensive protected-area and law enforcement legislation with staff training education and public awareness and research on both captive and wild populations (8) (6). A major result of this programme of conservation has been the creation of the Morne Diablotin National Park in the known nesting area for the species (5) first initiated in 1997 (8). An <i>in situ</i> captive programme has long been in place to research and rehabilitate the birds and a pair of imperial Amazons that has resided at the Parrot Conservation and Research Centre (Forestry Wildlife and Parks Headquarters in Roseau) since 2000 laid their first clutch of infertile eggs in April 2006 revealing important information about their reproductive biology (7). A very successful education programme in Dominica has substantially reduced trade and raised local awareness of the plight of Dominica\u2019s national symbol (2). International trade in this parrot is also tightly restricted by its listing under Appendices I of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) and the bird is protected by law on Dominica (2). The imperial Amazon\u2019s comeback from a small remnant population on the slopes of Morne Diablotin following Hurricane David to near pre-hurricane levels is a testament to the effectiveness of Dominica\u2019s long-term conservation efforts (8).,,,,,,,,,Incomati rock catlet,Incomati suckermouth ,Animalia,Chordata,Actinopterygii,Siluriformes,Mochokidae,Chiloglanis (1),Chiloglanis (1),[],[],,,,,,,,,,Narrow-headed Softshell Turtle,Indian narrow-head softshell turtle ,Animalia,Chordata,Reptilia,Testudines,Trionychidae,Chitra (1),Chitra (1),[],[],,,,,,,,,,social bat,Indiana bat ,Animalia,Chordata,Mammalia,Chiroptera,Vespertilionidae,Myotis (1),5 ‰ÛÒ 11 g (2),Recently the Indiana bat has been suffering from a decline in numbers due to a range of threats.  During <strong>hibernation</strong> the Indiana bat is vulnerable to human disturbance which can cause direct mortality or cause them to rouse and deplete their important energy reserves.  Disturbance can be in the form of researchers vandalism and the commercialization of caves allowing tourists to visit caves.  Modifications to mines and caves such as the construction of gates to restrict human access alter airflow temperature and humidity to which the Indiana bat is very sensitive; or gates may not allow sufficient flight space for the bats and thus block them from a critical <strong>hibernation</strong> site (2) (3).  As Indiana bats <strong>hibernate</strong> in very large numbers in only a few caves this makes them particularly vulnerable to disturbance and natural disasters as a large proportion of the total population can be affected by a single event (3).,As well as being classified as Endangered on the IUCN Red List 2007 (1) the Indiana bat is also listed as Endangered under the Endangered Species Act of 1973.  As an outcome of this the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service has drawn up a recovery plan with the goal of improving the status of the Indiana bat so that it can be removed from the Endangered Species List (3).  To reach the goal a number of actions are required; conserving and managing the hibernacula and the summer habitat conducting further essential research and implementing a public information and outreach program.  Dependent on funding and the implementation of conservation actions it has been estimated that the species can fully recover by the year 2027 (3).  At present the primary conservation effort has been to control human access of caves by erecting properly designed gates that keep people from disturbing hibernating bats while maintaining temperature humidity and allowing access for bats (3).,,,,,,,,,,Indri ÌÛ Queue Courte,Indri ,Animalia,Chordata,Mammalia,Primates,Indriidae,Indri (1),6 ‰ÛÒ 9.5 kg (2),The indri is one of the most endangered species of lemur on Madagascar and one of the most threatened primates in the world (4). They live by the coast where forests have become so fragmented that they are almost too small to sustain viable populations (6). The main threat is slash-and-burn agriculture a practice that continues even in protected areas (7). Forests are also cut down for fuel and timber as human populations increase (5). Hunting of the indri is a taboo in many areas on the island so this species does not suffer as much as other lemurs from trapping although sometimes it is killed for food (5) (7). Despite this the indri is a seriously endangered species and will almost certainly face extinction in the next 100 years if conservation efforts do not succeed (4).,The indri has never been bred successfully in captivity (7). Protection of their natural habitat is therefore imperative to ensure that they are not lost forever (6) (7). Unfortunately there is no easy answer to Madagascar\u2019s conservation problems. Despite the indri being endangered Madagascar\u2019s increasing human population needs space and resources and inevitably this erodes natural habitats (4). This problem is made worse because Madagascar is an island; this therefore limits the area that men and wildlife can expand into (6). Conservation plans have designated some areas of the island to be protected from deforestation but there is evidence that forest clearing continues inside the parks (5) (7). It would be sad indeed to see the indri populations once so prevalent dwindle away to nothing (6).,,,,,,,,,,Hylarana lepus occidentalis, Hylarana occidentalis, Rana amnirana occidentalis, Rana hylarana occidentalis, Rana occidentali,Ivory Coast frog ,Animalia,Chordata,Amphibia,Anura,Ranidae,Amnirana (1),Amnirana (1),[],[],,,,,,Manchurian crane, red-crowned crane,Japanese crane ,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Gruiformes,Gruidae,Grus (1),7,000 - 10,000 g (2),These beautiful birds were almost hunted to extinction in Japan at the beginning of the 20th century for their stunning plumage (9). Habitat losses due to agriculture and development have been further causes of the decline in the Japanese crane (1). Wetlands are fragile ecosystems and both the wintering and breeding grounds are under increasing risk of degradation and loss due to conversion to agriculture and industrial development (8).,A number of international agreements have been made to protect crane species and their habitats and it is illegal to hunt Japanese cranes in all countries in which they occur (6). Protected areas have been established to safeguard the species; furthermore conservation and educational programmes have been developed with the involvement of local communities and a number of reintroduction attempts have been made (6). Research into the ecology habitat needs and breeding biology of this graceful crane has been carried out since 1970 (6).,,,,,,,Saramugo,Jarabugo ,Animalia,Chordata,Actinopterygii,Cypriniformes,Cyprinidae,Anaecypris (1),Length: up to 7 cm (2),Once a relatively abundant fish in the Guadiana basin the jarabugo now has a fragmented distribution and has undergone a catastrophic decline in numbers (9). Between 1996 and 2006 this species\u2019 population decreased by over 50 percent a decrease that is ongoing despite the efforts of current conservation programs (1).,Extinction of the jarabugo seems inevitable unless there is a sustained conservation effort for this species (2). Conventional conservation strategies focusing around active breeding programmes or the transfer of individuals from one location to another are not viable because this small fish species is extremely sensitive to handling (9).,,,,,,,,,,moloch, silvery gibbon,Javan gibbon ,Animalia,Chordata,Mammalia,Primates,Hylobatidae,Hylobates (1),5.9 kg (4),The\xa0Javan gibbon has undergone a dramatic population decline principally as a result of habitat destruction (6) and also from the trapping of juveniles for the pet trade (2). The native forests of Java have been cleared for logging agriculture and development and the species has declined to fewer than 1000 individuals over the last 25 years (4). This gibbon appears to be on the very brink of extinction with only a handful of isolated viable populations remaining (6).,In light of the status of this species in the wild a Javan gibbon rescue and rehabilitation workshop was conducted in 1997 hosted by Conservation International and the University of Indonesia (2). It was agreed that a rescue and rehabilitation centre was needed and education programmes were proposed (5). Currently the only viable protected population is found within the Gunung Halimun National Park; if this attractive primate is to survive it is vital that protection both within the park and in other areas is increased (6).,,,,,,,,,Aguila-azor de Java,Javan hawk-eagle ,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Falconiformes,Accipitridae,Spizaetus (1),Length: 60 cm (2),Habitat loss caused the initial decline of this bird as the increasing human population of Java relies heavily on the natural resources of their island particularly its forests. Conversion to agriculture urban development and uncontrolled fire even in protected areas resulted in a sharp decline that prompted the Indonesian government to promote the Javan hawk-eagle to the status of \u2018national bird\u2019. However this move rebounded as trade in the species multiplied in response to its new significance and consequential desirability (2).,The range and population of this species have been surveyed revealing its presence in Gunung Haliman Gunung Gede-Pangrango and Meru Betiri National Parks. However despite the strict legislation protecting the eagle from hunting and trading it faces serious problems through ineffective enforcement of the law. An action plan has been compiled and conservation awareness programmes have begun. The action plan suggests that thorough ecological studies are performed to allow the implementation of management plans. Nest-guarding is being seriously considered as an option to enforce legislation protecting this beautiful species (2).,,,,,,,,,,Nycticebus coucang, Nycticebus coucang javanicus, Nycticebus ornatus,Javan slow loris ,Animalia,Chordata,Mammalia,Primates,Lorisidae,Nycticebus (1),750 - 1,150 g (3),Its large eyes and cute appearance make the Javan slow loris popular in the pet trade and illegal trade is still the most significant threat to this small primate despite national and international protection (1) (3) (5) (6) (9) (14). The number of Javan slow lorises sold in markets is too high for the wild population to be able to recover particularly given this species\u2019 low reproductive rate (5) (6) (15).,The Javan slow loris is protected under Indonesian law (1) (2) and is also listed on Appendix I of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) making international commercial trade in this primate illegal (4). Although the Javan slow loris occurs in a number of protected areas (1) (11) only around 17 percent of its potential distribution is protected (5) (6) and its status in some reserves is uncertain (1).,,,,,,,Blue-tailed trogon,Javan trogon ,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Trogoniformes,Trogonidae,Apalharpactes (1),Average head-body length: 34 cm (2),With only five percent of original forest cover remaining on Java the Javan trogon is primarily threatened by the loss degradation and fragmentation of its forest habitat (4) (6). Java is the most densely inhabited Indonesian island and urbanisation and agriculture continues to encroach upon the island\u2019s forests (7). However the montane forests that remain on Java are now relatively stable in their limited extent (8).,With a small population and an extremely restricted range the survival of the Javan trogon may be dependant upon the successful implementation of conservation measures (1). Thankfully this rare species has been afforded some protection in the Gunung Gede-Pangrango and Gunung Halimun National Parks with the latter supporting the largest remaining population (4). The Javan trogon will also benefit from further surveys aiming to determine the full extent of the species\u2019 range and the establishment of several new protected areas (4) (7).,,,,,,,,,,CÌ©phalophe De Jentink,Jentink‰Ûªs duiker ,Animalia,Chordata,Mammalia,Cetartiodactyla,Bovidae,Cephalophus (1),55 ‰ÛÒ 80 kg (2),Much of the natural forest within the range of the Jentink\u2019s duiker has been lost to human activities or modified by human disturbance; the area of <strong>primary forest</strong> in Sierra Leone is now just six percent of the original forest cover (9).  The remaining forest in C\xf4te d'Ivoire and Sierra Leone is highly fragmented and remains under pressure as humans seek to use more forest for farmland timber fuelwood and mineral resources (9).,Jentink\u2019s duiker is listed on Appendix I of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) meaning that international trade in this species is only allowed in exceptional circumstances (3).  However this does little to control the threat of hunting within its range countries and whilst in some areas of its distribution hunting of wild animals is now prohibited (2) such a ban is impractical and cannot be enforced (9).  Unlike Sierra Leone and C\xf4te d'Ivoire Liberia still holds some large areas of forest with the largest stands being in protected areas and forest reserves (9).  The continued protection of these areas appears to be essential to the continued survival of Jentink\u2019s duiker along with efforts to educate the public about the plight of duikers and the importance of sustainable hunting (10).,,,,,,,,,,Mirror fish,Jerdon's baril ,Animalia,Chordata,Actinopterygii,Cypriniformes,Cyprinidae,Barilius (1),Barilius (1),[],[],,,,,,,,,,Bufo gemmifer, Cranopsis gemmifer, Ollotis gemmifer,Jeweled toad ,Animalia,Chordata,Amphibia,Anura,Bufonidae,Incilius (1),Snout-vent length: up to 8 cm (2),The main threat to the jeweled toad is habitat loss due to the spread of agriculture the expansion of plantations and wood extraction. Its population is believed to be small and declining and its highly restricted distribution puts it at particular risk of extinction (1).,The jeweled toad is legally protected in Mexico but its only real chance of survival is likely to be the effective protection of suburban and tropical dry areas around Acapulco (1).,,,,,,,,Cedro Grande, Cedro Negro, Nogal,Juglans ,Plantae,Tracheophyta,Magnoliopsida,Juglandales,Juglandaceae,Juglans (1),Juglans (1),[],[],,,,,,,,Seven-striped barb,Jullien's golden carp ,Animalia,Chordata,Actinopterygii,Cypriniformes,Cyprinidae,Probarbus (1),Probarbus (1),[],[],,,,,,,,,,CÌ¬dre,Juniperus ,Plantae,Tracheophyta,Coniferopsida,Coniferales,Cupressaceae,Juniperus (1),Juniperus (1),[],[],,,,,,,,,,Idioptilon kaempferi,Kaempfer‰Ûªs tody-tyrant ,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Tyrannidae,Hemitriccus (1),Length: 10 cm (2),The population of Kaempfer\u2019s tody-tyrant is in decline the primary threat being the deforestation of lowland areas to make room for banana and rice plantations (2) (3). Other short-term threats include the urbanisation of the coastal plain and the construction of a road BR 101 which may lead to further fragmentation of the population. Possible sea-level rise also poses a potential long-term threat to Kaempfer\u2019s tody-tyrant (2).,Kaempfer\u2019s tody-tyrant is currently protected by Brazilian law (2) (6) as are two of the areas it can be found in Paran\xe1 and Santa Catarina (3). Further conservation measures for this species should include slowing the rate of deforestation and proper and regular surveys need to be conducted as current information on Kaempfer\u2019s tody-tyrant is only based on casual observations (3).,,,,,,,,,,Caatinga woodpecker, Piaui woodpecker,Kaempfer‰Ûªs woodpecker ,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Piciformes,Picidae,Celeus (1),Head-body length: 26 ‰ÛÒ 28 cm (2),The greatest threat to Kaempfer\u2019s woodpecker is the loss of its <em><strong>Cerrado</strong></em> habitat to infrastructure development and agriculture (2) (3) (7). Around three million hectares of <em><strong>Cerrado</strong></em> is destroyed each year within the region with road construction and the expansion of soya crop cultivation the primary agents. The species\u2019 habitat is also frequently degraded by artificial fires for cattle ranching (2). As a result of such severe threats Kaempfer\u2019s woodpecker is suspected to have a highly patchy distribution and a small population size currently estimated at no more than 250 mature individuals (2) (3).\xa0,As the species\u2019 habitat is still relatively prevalent and due to probable inconspicuous habits something that is characteristic of <em>Celeus</em> woodpeckers Kaempfers\u2019s woodpecker may be more numerous than currently thought. However with so little known about this elusive species there is a pressing need for further surveys to determine the full extent of the species\u2019 range and to make estimates of the population size (2).\xa0,,,,,,,,,KagÌ_,Kagu ,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Gruiformes,Rhynochetidae,Rhynochetos (1),Length: 55 cm (2),The loss of much of New Caledonia's native forests has caused the numbers of kagus to decline. Forests have been cleared for timber and to make way for agriculture and these birds have also traditionally been hunted for their meat. Kagus are island birds that have evolved in isolation and in the absence of terrestrial predators; when Europeans first arrived on New Caledonia they bought with them rats cats and dogs and these flightless birds represented easy prey (4). Today dogs may represent the most important threat to the survival of this species; in 1993 dogs killed 17 out of 21 radio-collared birds within the reserve of Pic Nigua alone (2).,Kagus are protected within the Riviere Bleue and dogs are controlled in this area (2). They are also found within the Reserve Speciale de Faune et de Flore de la Novdela where there is no dog control in place (2). In 1992 Birdlife International initiated a Recovery Programme for this species. A captive breeding programme run by the Southern Province and the Societe Caledonienne d'Ornithologie has been in place since 1978 (4) and juveniles have been released into the Riviere Bleue Park with some success (4). Dog attacks are difficult to control despite legislation and education of owners but remain a priority for the secure future of this species (2) which is now the national bird of New Caledonia (4).,,,,,,,,,,Kaka,Kaka ,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Psittaciformes,Psittacidae,Nestor (1),Size: 45 cm (2),This species is undergoing a continuous decline and in the last 45 years (three generations) has suffered a 10% population loss. Reasons for this marked decline include extensive habitat losses due to forest clearing pressures from hunting predators and introduced competitors (4).,To tackle the threats facing the kaka predator and pest control surveys are being carried out in several large areas and near nesting sites (2). Populations are also being monitored with juveniles being radio tracked to identify their movements habitat and food requirements and survival rates (4). In 1996 - 1997 a small population of 14 juveniles were successfully introduced into a new area Mt Bruce Reserve North Island (4). It is hoped that these measures will one day reverse the current population trend and allow the kaka to recover (4).,,,,,,,,,,Kowhai ngutukaka, lobster claw, New Zealand parrot‰Ûªs-bill, parrot‰Ûªs-bill,Kaka-beak ,Plantae,Tracheophyta,Magnoliopsida,Fabales,Leguminosae,Clianthus (1),Height: 90 ‰ÛÒ 180 cm (2)Leaf length: 7.5 - 15 cm (2)Flower length: up to 7.5 cm (2),The significant kaka-beak declines seen can probably by attributed to the combined impact of habitat destruction browsing by goats pigs deer and introduced brown snails and the fact that the species requires permanently open or early <strong>successional</strong> sites (1) (7). Due to its habitat requirements the kaka-beak was probably never a common plant and may owe its survival partly to the old-time Maori who cultivated it in their villages (6).   Today a large secure cultivated population exists although it appears to contain very limited genetic diversity (7).,Most of the 200 remaining wild specimens occur within the boundaries of the Te Urewera National Park and the extensive cultivated populations do provide potential for reintroductions. A Recovery Plan has also been devised for this popular wild shrub outlining management strategies to maintain existing populations and increase total numbers of wild plants (7).,,,,,,,Langbian flying frog,Kalakkad tree frog ,Animalia,Chordata,Amphibia,Anura,Rhacophoridae,Rhacophorus (1),Rhacophorus (1),[],[],,,,,,,,,,Chamba sacred langur, dark-eyed Himalayan langur, Himalayan gray langur, Himalayan grey langur, western Himalayan langur,Kashmir gray langur ,Animalia,Chordata,Mammalia,Primates,Cercopithecidae,Semnopithecus (1),Semnopithecus (1),[],[],,,,,,Kashmir musk-deer,Kashmir muskdeer ,Animalia,Chordata,Mammalia,Cetartiodactyla,Moschidae,Moschus (1),Moschus (1),[],[],,,,,,,,,,Jagged-shelled turtle, keel-backed terrapin,Keeled box turtle ,Animalia,Chordata,Reptilia,Testudines,Bataguridae,Cuora (1),Length: up to 18 cm (2),Despite its large distribution it is thought that numbers of the keeled box turtle have declined drastically in some areas primarily because of over-collection. This turtle is collected for local consumption and for the national and international food and pet trade and is exploited on such a large-scale it is highly unlikely to be sustainable. For example between 1994 and 1999 6560 keeled box turtles were legally exported from Vietnam. This major threat is compounded by habitat loss and degradation due to deforestation and shifting cultivation (7).,Due to the unsustainable trade in this species the keeled box turtle was listed in 2003 on Appendix II of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) and thus trade should now be strictly controlled and monitored (3). Unfortunately Lao PDR is not a party to CITES but has increased efforts to control wildlife trade in recent years and as a result fewer turtles are seen in markets (7).,,,,,,,,,Kelaart‰Ûªs toad,Kelaart‰Ûªs dwarf toad ,Animalia,Chordata,Amphibia,Anura,Bufonidae,Adenomus (1),Adenomus (1),[],[],,,,,,,,,,Agropyron dasyanthum,Kerch wheatgrass ,Plantae,Tracheophyta,Liliopsida,Cyperales,Gramineae,Agropyron (1),Agropyron (1),[],[],,,,,,,,,,Laotian rock rat,Kha-nyou ,Animalia,Chordata,Mammalia,Rodentia,Diatomyidae,Laonastes (1),Head-body length: 21.2 - 28.5 cm (2)Tail length: 12.3 ‰ÛÒ 16.1 cm (2),While the status of the kha-nyou is not entirely clear in the dry season local people target it for trapping and subsequent sell it for food in local markets where it is considered a delicacy.\xa0Given that female kha-nyous generally bear only one young at a time the level of sustainable hunting is probably not high (5). Its <strong>karst</strong> habitat is fairly resilient to degradation; however the more accessible areas are vulnerable to logging and firewood collection (1) (6). As a result of these threats and its small range estimated at no more than 5000 square kilometres the kha-nyou is thought to be undergoing a continuing decline (1).,The kha-nyou is afforded some sanctuary in Phou Hin Poun National Protected Area (formerly known as Khammouan Limestone National Biodiversity Conservation Area); however with little management in place in the protected areas and so little known about this rare rodent further research is needed to determine\xa0 its current status and conservation needs (1) (5).,,,,,,,,,,Bokikokiko,Kiritimati reed-warbler ,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Sylviidae,Acrocephalus (1),Acrocephalus (1),[],[],,,,,,,,,,Zanzibar red colobus,Kirk‰Ûªs red colobus ,Animalia,Chordata,Mammalia,Primates,Cercopithecidae,Procolobus (1),5.2 - 11.3 kg (2),Vast tracts of Zanzibar\u2019s native forest have been destroyed for timber development and agriculture leading to a devastating decline in the population of this native monkey. It is believed that fewer than 1500 Kirk\u2019s red colobus persist today (7).,Kirk\u2019s red colobus is listed as Class A under the African Convention on the Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources meaning that capture or killing of this species is prohibited unless for scientific purposes and with permission (10). It is also listed on Appendix II of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) meaning international trade in Kirk\u2019s red colobus should be carefully controlled (3).,,,,,,,,,,dwarf gibbon, Mentawai gibbon,Kloss‰Ûªs gibbon ,Animalia,Chordata,Mammalia,Primates,Hylobatidae,Hylobates (1),6 kg (2),The main threat facing these gibbons is habitat destruction and degradation caused by human activities in the area (1). Hunting is also a problem which worsens as habitat destruction continues as it allows greater access into the forest (2).,Kloss\u2019s gibbon is listed on Appendix I of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) which prohibits international trade in this species (3).,,,,,,,,,Narrow sawfish, pointed sawfish,Knifetooth sawfish ,Animalia,Chordata,Chondrichthyes,Rajiformes,Pristidae,Anoxypristis (1),Length: up to at least 470 cm (2),The knifetooth sawfish was once widespread and common throughout the Indo-West Pacific region but its population has become increasingly small and fragmented with the global population believed to have decreased by over 80 percent in the last 30 to 50 years (1) (6) (12). The unique structure of the saw makes all sawfish extremely vulnerable to entanglement and capture in a range of fishing gear both in targeted fisheries and as accidental <strong>bycatch</strong>. Although most landings are accidental the knifetooth sawfish is highly valued for its meat fins liver oil and skin and when caught is usually retained. The saw is also highly valued both as a curio and for use in traditional Chinese medicine (1) (2) (4) (6) (12). An increasing demand for live specimens for public aquaria may be putting further pressure on this species (1) (6) (11).,In 2007 the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) listed the knifetooth sawfish on Appendix I meaning that international trade in the species is now banned (3). The knifetooth sawfish is legally protected in India (1) (6) but little other effective legislation appears to exist for the species elsewhere (4). In Australia monitoring research and recovery plans have been recommended for all sawfish (6) (11) (12) but the knifetooth sawfish has yet to be listed there under the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act (EPBC) 1999 (1) (11). Recent advances in obtaining DNA samples from dry sawfish rostra (13) together with studies into DNA \u2018barcoding\u2019 from confiscated fins (14) may help fishing authorities to gather essential data on the illegal fishing of sawfish and other sharks and rays hopefully assisting in the management and conservation of this unique and Endangered fish.,,,,,,,,,Afrixalus brachycnemis knysnae, Hyperolius knysnae,Knysna banana frog ,Animalia,Chordata,Amphibia,Anura,Hyperoliidae,Afrixalus (1),Afrixalus (1),[],[],,,,,,,,,Kofiau paradise kingfisher,Kofiau paradise-kingfisher ,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Coraciiformes,Alcedinidae,Tanysiptera (1),Tanysiptera (1),[],[],,,,,,,,,,leafletted leaf-nosed bat,Kolar leaf-nosed bat ,Animalia,Chordata,Mammalia,Chiroptera,Hipposideridae,Hipposideros (1),Hipposideros (1),[],[],,,,,,,,,,chrome-yellow toad, Humbali village toad,Koyna toad ,Animalia,Chordata,Amphibia,Anura,Bufonidae,Xanthophryne (1),Xanthophryne (1),[],[],,,,,,,,,Krefft's river frog,Krefft's puddle frog ,Animalia,Chordata,Amphibia,Anura,Phrynobatrachidae,Phrynobatrachus (1),Phrynobatrachus (1),[],[],,,,,,,,,,Ryukyu eyelid gecko,Kuroiwa's ground gecko ,Animalia,Chordata,Reptilia,Squamata,Gekkonidae,Goniosaurus (1),Goniosaurus (1),[],[],,,,,,,,,,Barbus macrophtalmus,Labeobarbus ,Animalia,Chordata,Actinopterygii,Cypriniformes,Cyprinidae,Labeobarbus (1),Labeobarbus (1),[],[],,,,,,,,,,Eupsophus lancinii,Lancinis robber frog ,Animalia,Chordata,Amphibia,Anura,Leptodactylidae,Eleutherodactylus (1),Eleutherodactylus (1),[],[],,,,,,,,,,Aromobates molinarii, Colostethus molinarii,Las Playitas rocket frog ,Animalia,Chordata,Amphibia,Anura,Dendrobatidae,Nephelobates (1),Nephelobates (1),[],[],,,,,,,,,Philautus folicola,Leaf-dwelling shrub frog ,Animalia,Chordata,Amphibia,Anura,Rhacophoridae,Pseudophilautus (1),Pseudophilautus (1),[],[],,,,,,,,,,green bush frog, plain green bush frog, round-snout pygmy tree frog, southwestern bubble-nest frog,Leaf-nesting shrub frog ,Animalia,Chordata,Amphibia,Anura,Rhacophoridae,Pseudophilautus (1),Pseudophilautus (1),[],[],,,,,,,Indigo macaw,Lear's macaw ,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Psittaciformes,Psittacidae,Anodorhynchus (1),Length: 74 cm (2),Lear's macaw is thought to be a naturally rare species (4) and population numbers were low when it was discovered in 1978. The major threat to this species comes from the illegal wildlife trade. Collectors will pay high prices for such rare and beautiful birds and a breeding pair is thought to be worth as much as \xa350000 on the black market (4). The population of Lear's macaws is also highly influenced by the availability of their principal food source the licuri palm numbers of which have recently been vastly reduced due to livestock-grazing (5). A major fire could now wipe the whole palm population out (5) leaving this parrot fatally vulnerable.,Although protected by the Brazilian government and listed on Appendix I of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) effectively banning international trade in the species the Lear's macaw remains critically at danger from illegal trade (5). Recent infiltration of poaching rings and guarding of roosting sites may be finally slowing the decline in this species and there are plans to grow and fence 50000 licuri palm seedlings (5). A recent population survey has reported an encouraging increase in Lear's macaw numbers in the wild; in the municipalities of Canudos and Jeremoabo the population now stands at around 455 individuals (6). The steady increase in the population has led to the IUCN downgrading the Lear\u2019s macaw from Critically Endangered to Endangered in 2009 although continued conservation measures and repeated monitoring of the population remain high priorities to ensure the continued protection of this species (8).,,,,,,,,,,Vipera bornmuelleri,Lebanon viper ,Animalia,Chordata,Reptilia,Squamata,Viperidae,Montivipera (1),Montivipera (1),The Lebanon viper has a restricted range and is therefore vulnerable to habitat degradation (1). Its habitat is currently threatened by overgrazing by domestic livestock and the use of off-road vehicles (1).,While there are currently no known conservation actions specifically targeting the Lebanon viper it is known to occur in protected areas in both Lebanon and Syria (1). Recommended conservation actions for this species include the management of its remaining habitat (1).,,,,,,,,,,Iguane des Petites Antilles,Lesser Antillean iguana ,Animalia,Chordata,Reptilia,Squamata,Iguanidae,Iguana (1),Male snout to vent length: 43 cm (2)Female snout to vent length: 39 cm (2)Male weight: 3.5 kg (2)Female weight: 2.6 kg (2),In the past the Lesser Antillean iguana has been brought to near or total local extinction by clearance of suitable habitat for agriculture on St. Kitts Nevis Basse Terre and St. Eustatius. Now tourism has taken over from agriculture as their chief industry and coastal development has further decimated iguana habitats particularly affecting communal nest sites (2).,The Lesser Antillean iguana is legally protected from hunting throughout its range but law enforcement is limited. It occurs only in one protected area: Cabrits National Park on Dominica. Proposals for the creation of nature reserves in other areas of the iguana\u2019s range have been put forward and research into the population biology ecology and conservation management plans is underway. Captive breeding programmes are run at Durrell Wildlife Conservation Trust Memphis Zoo and San Diego Zoo (2).,,,,,,,,,,Eupodotis indica,Lesser florican ,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Gruiformes,Otididae,Sypheotides (1),Length: 46 - 51 cm (2),A steady decline in the population of the lesser florican began around the 1870s principally as a consequence of relentless hunting for sport and food (2). In time other familiar threats became increasingly more significant including habitat loss through agricultural land conversion and over-grazing of livestock and the rapid encroachment of non-native vegetation (2) (6). In the 1980s the world population of lesser florican declined by 60 percent to just over 1600 birds but fortunately rebounded by the mid 1990s to a moderately less alarming 2200. These recent fluctuations have been found to closely match breeding season rainfall patterns and reveal the vulnerability of the species to extinction in the event of a severe drought. Worryingly it is anticipated that the pressure on remaining grassland habitat is set to continue in the future and as result the rate of decline in the lesser florican population will increase (2).,Despite the prohibition of hunting of lesser floricans throughout India and inclusion on Appendix II of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) and under Schedule 1 of the Wildlife (Protection) Act 1972 the species\u2019 long-term survival remains uncertain because of the continued threat of rapid habitat loss coupled with high vulnerability to drought (2) (3) (6). In an effort to preserve breeding habitat two lesser florican sanctuaries Sailana and Sardarpur in Madhya Pradesh were established in 1983 (2) (7) (8). However the value of these sanctuaries is limited by the movement of monsoonal conditions which determine which areas lesser floricans choose to breed. If weather conditions are unfavourable in any given year only a small number of floricans may actually breed within the protective bounds of the sanctuaries (8). In recent years a proposal known as \u2018Project Bustards\u2019 has been put to the Indian government to ensure the survival of India\u2019s four species of bustard all of which are endangered (2) (8). This broadly includes: strictly protecting bustard habitat involving local communities in conservation establishing regional cooperation amongst different states and increasing scientific research into bustard ecology. An ambitious proposal specific to the lesser florican is to develop a network of fodder-producing grasslands throughout its range to afford local communities fodder security whilst also providing optimal breeding habitat for the lesser florican during the monsoon (8). Unfortunately until \u2018Project Bustard\u2019 receives government approval these vitally important proposals remain on paper and the lesser florican leaps ever closer to extinction.,,,,,,,,,,LÌ©zard De Lilford, LÌ©zard Des BalÌ©ares,Lilford's wall lizard ,Animalia,Chordata,Reptilia,Squamata,Lacertidae,Podarcis (1),Adult snout-vent length: 5 - 7 cm (2) (3)Adult weight: 4.2 - 9.5 g (2),The total population of Lilford's wall lizard is comprised of several small isolated and fragmented populations thus making this species extremely vulnerable to localised extinctions (1). Lilford's wall lizard has disappeared from the main islands of Mallorca and Menorca due to the introduction of cats and other non-native predators (1). It is therefore likely that the <strong>translocation</strong> of other invasive predators between islands by humans whether intentional or accidental will have a similar effect on remaining populations of Lilford's wall lizard in the region (1) (3).,Lilford's wall lizard is listed on Appendix II of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) meaning that all international trade in this species should be carefully regulated (4). It is also included on Annex II of the Bern Convention and is therefore listed as a strictly protected species in Europe (10).\xa0,,,,,,,,,Siempreviva Lunaria,Limonium ,Plantae,Tracheophyta,Magnoliopsida,Plumbaginales,Plumbaginaceae,Limonium (1),Limonium (1),[],[],,,,,,,,,,Macaque ÌÛ Queue De Lion, Macaque OuandÌ©rou, OuandÌ©rou,Lion-tailed macaque ,Animalia,Chordata,Mammalia,Primates,Cercopithecidae,Macaca (1),Male head-and-body length: 51 ‰ÛÒ 61 cm (2)Female head-and-body length: 42 ‰ÛÒ 46 cm (2)Male tail length: 24 ‰ÛÒ 39 cm (2)Female tail length: 25 ‰ÛÒ 32 cm (2)Male weight: 5 ‰ÛÒ 10 kg (2)Female weight: 2 ‰ÛÒ 6 kg (2),Lion-tailed macaques are increasingly rare mainly as a result of the destruction of their forest home. Only 1% of the original habitat remains today due to widespread deforestation for timber agriculture and development (4). This species persists in isolated pockets of remaining forest which can lead to <strong>inbreeding depression</strong> thus further threatening their precarious status (5). Additional threats come from hunting; they may be persecuted as crop pests and are often mistaken for Nilgiri langurs (<i>Semnopithecus johnii</i>) whose meat is erroneously believed to have medicinal properties (2) (4).,This species is one of the most endangered macaques in the world (4). International trade is banned by their listing on Appendix I of the International Convention on Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) and they are also protected by Indian law (7). Lion-tailed macaques are found in at least 21 protected areas (2) but they are the subject of few studies or conservation programmes (4). A large captive population has been developed in American and European zoos as part of a Species Survival Plan (SSP) and this population has the potential to be used in reintroductions should this become necessary (2).,,,,,,,,Comoro black fruit bat, Livingstone‰Ûªs bat,Livingstone‰Ûªs flying fox ,Animalia,Chordata,Mammalia,Chiroptera,Pteropodidae,Pteropus (1),500 ‰ÛÒ 800 g (2),Once abundant in the vast forests of Anjouan and Moheli extensive deforestation has led to the worryingly small populations of Livingstone\u2019s flying fox in existence today (9).,A conservation action plan for Old World Fruit Bats which includes Livingstone\u2019s flying fox was published in 1992 by the World Conservation Union (IUCN) which outlined a number of measures required for the survival of this species.  One recommendation was the establishment of a captive breeding programme (9) which was quickly initiated.  In 1992 five male and one female Livingstone\u2019s flying foxes were imported to the Jersey Wildlife Preservation Trust (now the Durrell Wildlife Conservation Trust).  This captive population increased in 1993 with the addition of five more males and another female and five further females were added in 1995 (10).  The programme has apparently been successful with (as of 2002) 42 individuals existing in captivity in three colonies at Jersey and Bristol zoos (11).  In 2007 a new comprehensive plan called the <i>Conservation Action Plan for Livingstone\u2019s Flying Fox</i> was developed for the species and its habitat.  This plan identified a conservation strategy focusing on actions such as habitat protection forest management environmental education population monitoring captive breeding and ecological research.  Initial steps are now underway to implement this plan (12).,,,,,,,,,Caouanne, Tortue Caouanne,Loggerhead turtle ,Animalia,Chordata,Reptilia,Testudines,Cheloniidae,Caretta (1),Adults: 75 - 160 kg (2)Record weight: 227+ kg (2)Length: 80 - 100 cm (2)Record length: 122+ cm (2),Long-distance migration makes loggerheads particularly vulnerable to accidental capture by commercial fisheries (<strong>bycatch</strong>) and turtles can become caught in shrimp trawler nets or entangled in longlines leading to mortal injuries or death by drowning (7). Fisheries captured 32000 loggerhead turtles in the Atlantic and 10500 in the Gulf of Mexico in 1987 alone (7). Loggerheads are unlikely to be deliberately hunted for their meat which is not considered a delicacy but eggs are collected in many parts of the world (7). Habitat loss or disturbance particularly developments on nesting beaches is the main threat to this species (9).,Loggerheads are nominally protected throughout most of their range and international trade is prohibited by their listing on Appendix I of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) (3). Nesting occurs on relatively few protected beaches however and increased protection remains a conservation priority. In Oman if locals must collect eggs they are encouraged to only take them from below the high water mark thus securing an income without harming the turtles' survival chances (9). Turtle Excluder Devices (TEDs) fitted to shrimp trawlers can help prevent <strong>bycatch</strong> by only allowing shrimp-sized objects to enter the nets and these are now being adopted by many of the world's fisheries (7).,,,,,,,,,Colostethus elachyhistus,Loja rocket frog ,Animalia,Chordata,Amphibia,Anura,Dendrobatidae,Hyloxalus (1),Hyloxalus (1),[],[],,,,,,,,,,long-legged warbler,Long-legged thicketbird ,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Sylviidae,Trichocichla (1),Trichocichla (1),[],[],,,,,,,,,,Vandeleuria oleracea nilagirica,Long-tailed climbing mouse ,Animalia,Chordata,Mammalia,Rodentia,Muridae,Vandeleuria (1),c. 10 g (2),Occupying an area no more than 500 square kilometres the long-tailed climbing mouse is threatened by the loss and degradation of its habitat (1). Changes in forestry management with the increasing use of pesticides and native tree canopy species being replaced with exotics has resulted in forest fragmentation and gaps in the canopy (1) (3). Coffee plantations have also been felled and replaced with ginger cultivation (3). Consequently many populations of the long-tailed climbing mouse have been left isolated greatly increasing the species extinction risk (1).,There are currently no conservation measures in place for the long-tailed climbing mouse and it is not known to occur in any protected areas. However further surveys in the Brahmagiri and Pushpagiri Wildlife Sanctuaries may find additional populations. This Endangered species will also benefit from further studies into its distribution ecology and population status (1).,,,,,,,,,,BÌ_ho PequeÌ±o de Bigotes Alargados, Lechucita Bigotona Mochuelo Peludo,Long-whiskered owlet ,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Strigiformes,Strigidae,Xenoaglaux (1),Length: 13 ‰ÛÒ 14 cm (2),The primary threat to the long-whiskered owlet is the loss of its humid forest habitat (10). The tropical Andes including the owlet\u2019s range are classified as a biodiversity hotspot but it is estimated that only 25 percent of the original habitat remains in this area (11). Although some areas of <strong>montane forest</strong> in north-east Peru remain relatively pristine (12) deforestation is accelerating (10).,The main conservation measures aimed at or affecting the long-whiskered owlet involve the protection of its habitat. Until recently the owlet\u2019s habitat was completely unprotected (6); although the species occurred near to the Alto Mayo Protected Forest in San Mart\xedn (2) protection was only partial (14) and had little effect on the rate of deforestation (2).,,,,,,,,,Lord Howe rail,Lord Howe Island woodhen ,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Gruiformes,Rallidae,Gallirallus (1),Length: 46 cm (2),During the 19th Century the population of Lord Howe woodhen was decimated by the introduction of predators and by habitat disturbance caused by settlers arriving on the island (4). Recent control measures mean that feral animals are not such a threat today although the introduction of the Australian masked-owl (<i>Tyto novaehollandiae castaneothorax</i>) in an effort to control rat numbers in the 1920s is thought to have been responsible for a major decline in one population in 1989 (5). As it is restricted to a single island the woodhen remains highly vulnerable to natural catastrophes or the accidental introduction of further non-native predators or disease (5).,In the mid-1970s the population of Lord Howe woodhen teetered on the brink of extinction as the population reached a new low of less than 30 individuals (4). Since that time conservation efforts such as the removal of wild pigs and the release of captive-bred birds have helped this species to slowly recover. The population is now estimated at 130 birds (2002) and the local community is very involved with conservation efforts which can minimise the threat of predation and disturbance by pet dogs (5). The trends in population numbers continue to be monitored but at this time the future looks encouraging for the Lord Howe woodhen.,,,,,,,,,,Eleutherodactylus scoloblepharus,Los Patos robber frog ,Animalia,Chordata,Amphibia,Anura,Strabomantidae,Pristimantis (1),Pristimantis (1),[],[],,,,,,,,,,Louisiana pinesnake,Louisiana pine snake ,Animalia,Chordata,Reptilia,Squamata,Colubridae,Pituophis (1),Total length: up to 179 cm (2),The Louisiana pine snake\u2019s natural habitat is one of the most threatened ecosystems in the United States (12). Most of the longleaf pine ecosystem has been logged or has been destroyed or degraded by other land uses such as urbanisation agriculture and intensive cultivation of other pine species (1) (2) (3) (4) (10). Only around three percent of its original extent now remains (13).,A Candidate Conservation Agreement was established in 2004 to protect conserve and manage the Louisiana pine snake. This agreement involves protecting remaining populations and their habitat restoring degraded habitat maintaining the longleaf pine ecosystem and reducing the threats to the Louisiana pine snake\u2019s survival (1) (4).,,,,,,,,,,Kyarranus loveridgei,Loveridge‰Ûªs frog ,Animalia,Chordata,Amphibia,Anura,Limnodynastidae,Philoria (1),Philoria (1),[],[],,,,,,,,,,Anoa Des Plaines,Lowland anoa ,Animalia,Chordata,Mammalia,Cetartiodactyla,Bovidae,Bubalus (1),Tail length: 40 cm (2)Head/body length: 180 cm (2)Male height: 27-37 cm (2)Female height: 18-26 cm (2),The population of this buffalo has declined significantly. The major threats are hunting and habitat loss which is occurring in Sulawesi due to the draining of marshland agricultural development and logging (1). Anoas are hunted for their desirable meat which is sold in local markets. In addition the skull and the horns are made into trophies souvenirs and used in traditional medicine (4). ,Sulawesi\u2019s forests have the highest level of mammal <strong>endemism</strong> in Asia and there are several conservation programmes underway on the island (7). The lowland anoa is fully protected under Indonesian law though there is concern that this is not enforced well enough as hunting continues even inside protected reserves (1). This water buffalo does occur in several protected areas on the island but unlike many wild cattle of Southeast Asia this species depends mainly on undisturbed forest (1).,,,,,,,,,,Outarde de Ludwig,Ludwig's bustard ,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Gruiformes,Otididae,Neotis (1),Neotis (1),[],[],,,,,,,,,,Johnson‰Ûªs tody-tyrant, Lulu‰Ûªs tody-flycatcher,Lulu‰Ûªs tody-tyrant ,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Tyrannidae,Poecilotriccus (1),Poecilotriccus (1),[],[],,,,,,,,,Lyciasalamandra lushchani,Luschan‰Ûªs salamander ,Animalia,Chordata,Amphibia,Caudata,Salamandridae,Lyciasalamandra (1),Lyciasalamandra (1),[],[],,,,,,,,,,Lyciasalamandra lushchani,Luschan‰Ûªs salamander ,Animalia,Chordata,Amphibia,Caudata,Salamandridae,Lyciasalamandra (1),Lyciasalamandra (1),[],[],,,,,,,,,,Mertensiella luschani flavimembris,Lycian salamander ,Animalia,Chordata,Amphibia,Caudata,Salamandridae,Lyciasalamandra (1),Lyciasalamandra (1),[],[],,,,,,,,,,Mertensiella luschani fazilae,Lycian salamander ,Animalia,Chordata,Amphibia,Caudata,Salamandridae,Lyciasalamandra (1),Lyciasalamandra (1),[],[],,,,,,,,,,Stenophis inopinae,Lycodryas ,Animalia,Chordata,Reptilia,Squamata,Lamprophiidae,Lycodryas (1),Lycodryas (1),[],[],,,,,,,,,,Maathai‰Ûªs clubtail,Maathai‰Ûªs longleg ,Animalia,Arthropoda,Insecta,Odonata,Gomphidae,Notogomphus (1),Male abdomen length: 35.1 mm (2)Female abdomen length: 35.7 mm (2),The montane forest habitat on which this species appears to rely has been widely destroyed in recent decades and Maathai\u2019s longleg is therefore presumed to have suffered significant declines. As deforestation continues due to an expanding and encroaching human population this rare dragonfly is expected to be up-listed to Critically Endangered on the IUCN Red List before too long (1).,"In the densely populated Kenyan highlands Maathai\u2019s longleg serves as an indicator of habitat quality and is therefore being promoted as a flagship species to raise awareness about the need to protect the natural forest and <strong>watershed</strong> (1) (5). Protection of its riverside forests will not only help this endangered dragonfly but also the farmers of the foothills by guaranteeing soil stability and a steady flow of water (5). To this end dragonflies such as this species are being dubbed the ""guardians of the watershed"" in East Africa helping to raise their profile in the field of conservation (5) (6).",,,,,,,,,,Mantidactylus corvus,Madagascan frog ,Animalia,Chordata,Amphibia,Anura,Mantellidae,Gephyromantis (1),Gephyromantis (1),[],[],,,,,,,,,,Mantidactylus silvanus,Madagascar frog ,Animalia,Chordata,Amphibia,Anura,Mantellidae,Gephyromantis (1),Gephyromantis (1),[],[],,,,,,,,,,Humblot‰Ûªs heron, Malagasy heron,Madagascar heron ,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Ciconiiformes,Ardeidae,Ardea (1),Length: 92 ‰ÛÒ 100 cm (2),Although it is likely that the Madagascar heron was never particularly abundant (2) a variety of human activities have made this bird extremely rare placing it at risk of extinction (4).  Wetland habitats in Madagascar have been lost to conversion to rice cultivation and degraded by siltation as a result of deforestation in the surrounding land (4).  The collection of the heron\u2019s eggs and the capture of nestlings by local people for food is also impacting heron populations (2) (4) and these damaging activities are only expected to increase as the human population in western Madagascar continues to rise (4).  The depletion of the heron\u2019s prey by local fisheries is also a potential threat (4).  Finally wetlands in Madagascar have been declining for a long time as the climate has become increasingly drier (4) hinting at the negative impact global climate change could have on this species.,Fortunately the Madagascar heron occurs in four protected areas in west Madagascar (2) including Ankarafantsika Strict Reserve Ankarana Special Reserve and Baly Bay National Park but with around 50 percent of the global population living outside protected areas (4) clearly more needs to be done.  Surveys to locate important nesting and feeding sites of the Madagascar heron have been recommended (2) (4) as well as the effective protection of known sites and further research to determine this species\u2019 biology and conservation needs (2).  The rarity of this Endangered bird makes it one of the heron species most in need of protection and conservation (2); hopefully suitable and effective conservation action will be implemented in the near future.,,,,,,,,,HÌ©ron crabier blanc,Madagascar pond heron ,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Ciconiiformes,Ardeidae,Ardeola (1),Length: 45 - 48 cm (2),It is thought that the population is declining quickly largely due to over-harvesting of the eggs and young (1). Furthermore the introduced invasive fish <i>Micropterus salmoides</i> may be competing with this heron for food (2).,The Madagascar pond-heron has been classified as Vulnerable by the IUCN Red List (1) and is included in Appendix II of the Convention on Migratory Species (CMS) (2). Suggested measures include carrying out surveys on this species to gain a better knowledge of the size of the population. More research is needed on the ecology of the species in order to better understand the threats facing it at present. Important colonies must be protected and a local public education campaign has been proposed to try to reduce harvesting of the eggs (2).,,,,,,,,,,Madagascar serpent eagle,Madagascar serpent-eagle ,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Falconiformes,Accipitridae,Eutriorchis (1),Eutriorchis (1),[],[],,,,,,,,,,Bernier‰Ûªs teal,Madagascar teal ,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Anseriformes,Anatidae,Anas (1),Length: 40 - 45 cm (2),The Madagascar teal is threatened throughout its range (2) largely by the massive destruction of wetland habitats that has occurred in Madagascar (4). Conversion of shallow water bodies required by this species in the dry season to rice cultivation has been rife on the west coast of Madagascar and today mangroves are in demand for prawn pond construction and timber extraction both of which result in an increase in hunting for food (2) (5).,The Madagascar teal is listed as Endangered by the IUCN Red List which means that it faces a high risk of extinction in the wild (1). International trade in the species is controlled by its listing under Appendix II of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) (3). The Durrell Wildlife Conservation Trust initiated a captive breeding programme for this species in 1993. This programme has had great success and shed light on certain details of the life-cycle and behaviour of this elusive and shy duck. However until major steps are taken to protect the remaining habitat of the species in the wild reintroduction measures will be unlikely. Community education programmes and habitat protection are essential if this desperately threatened duck is to survive (4).,,,,,,,,,,Berthe‰Ûªs mouse lemur,Madame Berthe‰Ûªs mouse lemur ,Animalia,Chordata,Mammalia,Primates,Cheirogaleidae,Microcebus (1),30 g (3),Like many Madagascan species Madame Berthe\u2019s mouse lemur is threatened by habitat loss due to illegal logging and <strong>slash-and-burn</strong> agriculture (1). With its highly restricted range and a global population estimated to be no more than 8000 mature individuals this species faces an uncertain future (3).,While there are no known conservation measures specifically directed towards Madame Berthe\u2019s mouse lemur a 1000 square kilometre Central Menabe Conservation Site has been proposed which will encompass this species\u2019 entire range. Furthermore the Kirindy Forest where this species is particularly abundant will be classified as a strict conservation zone providing the highest levels of protection from habitat exploitation and hopefully halting this remarkable species\u2019 decline (1).,,,,,,,,,,Pipistrelle De MadÌ¬re,Madeira pipistrelle ,Animalia,Chordata,Mammalia,Chiroptera,Vespertilionidae,Pipistrellus (1),2.9 - 5.7 g (2),Although the Madeira pipistrelle is seemingly well adapted to man-made or human influenced habitats (1) the loss or degradation of its natural habitat is likely to pose a threat to its survival (1) (2) (9). Agricultural pesticide use also presents an additional risk as the toxic chemicals used in farming can contaminate the prey on which these bats feed (1) (2).,The Madeira pipistrelle is protected through the Bern Convention (11) and by its listing on Annex IV of the EU Habitats and Species Directive which means that protective measures must be taken to ensure its conservation (12). It is also protected under the Agreement on the Conservation of Populations of European Bats (EUROBATS) which aims to protect all 52 species of bats in Europe through legislation education conservation measures and international co-operation (13).\xa0,,,,,,,,,,Leiostyla laevigata,Madeiran land snail ,Animalia,Mollusca,Gastropoda,Stylommatophora,Lauriidae,Leiostyla (1),Leiostyla (1),[],[],,,,,,,,,,Talauma hernandezii,Magnolia ,Plantae,Tracheophyta,Magnoliopsida,Magnoliales,Magnoliaceae,Magnolia (1),Magnolia (1),[],[],,,,,,,,,,Talauma narinensis,Magnolia ,Plantae,Tracheophyta,Magnoliopsida,Magnoliales,Magnoliaceae,Magnolia (1),Magnolia (1),[],[],,,,,,,,,,Talauma sanderiana,Magnolia ,Plantae,Tracheophyta,Magnoliopsida,Magnoliales,Magnoliaceae,Magnolia (1),Magnolia (1),[],[],,,,,,,,,,Talauma dixonii,Magnolia ,Plantae,Tracheophyta,Magnoliopsida,Magnoliales,Magnoliaceae,Talauma (1),Talauma (1),[],[],,,,,,,,,,Talauma polyhypsophylla,Magnolia ,Plantae,Tracheophyta,Magnoliopsida,Magnoliales,Magnoliaceae,Magnolia (1),Magnolia (1),[],[],,,,,,,,,,Talauma gilbertoi,Magnolia ,Plantae,Tracheophyta,Magnoliopsida,Magnoliales,Magnoliaceae,Magnolia (1),Magnolia (1),[],[],,,,,,,,,,black microhylid, Kerala hills frog,Malabar black narrow-mouthed frog ,Animalia,Chordata,Amphibia,Anura,Microhylidae,Melanobatrachus (1),Melanobatrachus (1),[],[],,,,,,,,,Malagasy giant jumping rat,Malagasy giant rat ,Animalia,Chordata,Mammalia,Rodentia,Nesomyidae,Hypogeomys (1),1 ‰ÛÒ 1.5 kg (2),Like many of Madagascar\u2019s unique species the Malagasy giant rat is thought to have become highly endangered due to habitat loss and disturbance and predation by and competition with introduced species (8). For centuries Madagascar\u2019s forests have experienced successive waves of degradation at the hands of human colonists each with different destructive patterns of land use (7). In more recent years illegal and commercial logging charcoal production and burning to clear land for agriculture or cattle pasture have all had a devastating impact often changing open forest into dense shrubby undergrowth unsuitable as rat habitat or destroying the vegetation completely (3). The rats continue to suffer from human disturbance in the remaining forests which are used by the villagers to gather firewood collect honey dig up edible roots and hunt tenrecs and lemurs (3) (7). Predation by introduced predators such as dogs may also be playing a significant role in this species\u2019 decline (3).,This large rodent is in urgent need of conservation and its future remains highly uncertain. The Durrell Wildlife Conservation Trust is currently working closely with the Madagascan government and local community to help protect the species and has also established a captive breeding programme (5). The Menabe Forest an Alliance for Zero Extinction site due to the presence of this and a number of other endangered species was previously heavily impacted by subsistence farming wood extraction and livestock ranching. Fortunately in order to protect its unique but rapidly diminishing biodiversity the Madagascan government aims to expand the nation\u2019s protected area network and on March 28 2006 the Minister of the Environment Water and Forests signed a decree giving 125000 hectares of Menabe Forest temporary protected status. This is the first step towards making the site an official protected area. However while community and conservation groups have begun the slow process of agreeing on the official boundaries and goals of the new protected area (9) prospectors have begun using dynamite to search for oil reserves in Menabe causing concerns about further forest degradation (7). Official full protected status is urgently needed in this area if the Malagasy giant rat is to be successfully brought back from the brink of extinction.,,,,,,,,,,Bornean river turtle,Malaysian giant turtle ,Animalia,Chordata,Reptilia,Testudines,Geoemydidae,Orlitia (1),Adult shell length: up to 80 cm (2)Hatchling shell length: 6 cm (2)Adult weight: 50 kg (3),The forest-dwelling people of the Malaysian Peninsula continue to rely on freshwater turtles as part of their hunter-gatherer lifestyle while throughout southeast Asia freshwater turtles are unsustainably exploited for local food sources international trade and medicinal markets (9) (10).,The Malaysian giant turtle is protected in Sarawak on the island of Borneo under the Fauna Conservation Ordinance of 1963; however this species is not protected in every state of Malaysia (8).,,,,,,,,,,Nectophrynoides malcolmi,Malcolm‰Ûªs Ethiopia toad ,Animalia,Chordata,Amphibia,Anura,Bufonidae,Altiphrynoides (1),Altiphrynoides (1),[],[],,,,,,,,,,Eleutherodactylus loustes,Maldonado robber frog ,Animalia,Chordata,Amphibia,Anura,Strabomantidae,Pristimantis (1),Pristimantis (1),[],[],,,,,,,,,,Gray's brush-turkey, maleo megapode,Maleo ,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Galliformes,Megapodiidae,Macrocephalon,Size: 55-60 cm (2),The maleo has become endangered due to the cumulative effects of various threats (4). Unsustainable harvesting of its eggs by locals for food and human disturbance of nesting grounds have led to the abandonment of most coastal nesting colonies which has disastrous effects on the maleo\u2019s breeding potential. A recent survey indicated that of the 131 formerly known nesting grounds an astounding 42 have been abandoned by the maleo. Furthermore 38 are severely threatened 34 are threatened 12 are of unknown status and only five are not yet threatened (4).,This <strong>endemic</strong> species has been protected under Indonesian law since 1972 and over 50% of (chiefly inland) nesting grounds occur within protected areas. Conservation measures at present include researching the numbers of breeding birds the effectiveness of hatcheries and artificial incubation programmes sustainable egg-collection practices and renewing local community-based protection projects (4). Eco-tourism is also being encouraged as an alternative income to egg-harvesting (2). There are also plans to improve management practices in protected areas and extend these protected ranges to encompass other important nesting sites and forest corridors which will link fragmented areas together (4).,,,,,,,,,Amazilia de Manglar,Mangrove hummingbird ,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Apodiformes,Trochilidae,Amazilia (1),Head-body length: 10 ‰ÛÒ 11 cm (2)Average weight: 4.5 g (2),The mangrove hummingbird is almost totally restricted to mangrove forests in Costa Rica a habitat that has been seriously depleted and consequently it is extremely vulnerable to further habitat loss (8) (9). Although it is illegal to destroy mangrove forests in Costa Rica laws are largely ignored and the entire Pacific coast of Costa Rica is under significant pressure from coastal developments for industry and tourism (4). Large tracts of mangrove forest have been cleared to make room for salt extraction and shrimp ponds while the wood may be exploited to produce charcoal. Mangroves are also threatened by agriculture and urban encroachment pollution and by dyke and road construction which affect the water hydrology (8) (10).,Restricted to a dwindling habitat in a single region the survival of the mangrove hummingbird is dependant upon the implementation of major conservation measures (1) (6). Fortunately for this species a wealth of conservation initiatives have been proposed including further studies into its ecology and status the establishment of protected areas and the development of a conservation action plan (4) (6). The mangrove hummingbird is also afforded a degree of sanctuary in the Tivives Biological Reserve while a substantial population is believed to reside in Estero Guacalillos Biological Reserve (6) (8).,,,,,,,,,,Chinese pit viper, ironhead pitviper, Mang Mountain pit viper, Mangshan pitviper, Mt.

There are thought to be only about 500 individuals of this species in existence and the population is continuing to decline (1) (3).,The Mangshan pit viper receives some protection through its presence in Mangshan Natural Nature Reserve (1) and it is listed on Appendix II of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) which means that trade in this snake should be carefully monitored and controlled (4).

Originally logging was responsible for large-scale habitat destruction but still left some inaccessible forest. Now however <strong>slash-and-burn</strong> cultivation threatens these remote inaccessible upland habitats as new access routes are created (2) (3).,The mao is present in rainforest preserves at Tafua Peninsula Falealupo Aopo Cloud Forest and O Le Pupu Pu`e National Park.

The marine otter has been hunted for many centuries for its pelts which are used mainly for footwear. This has resulted in continuing population declines across the range. More recently the marine otter has also been subjected to habitat loss as a growing tourism industry has led to increased coastal construction and participation in water sports. Water pollution following oil spills and heavy metal mining over-fishing of prey species persecution by fishermen and drowning in crab traps and fishing nets are also contributing to this charismatic species\u2019 decline (2).,The marine otter is legally protected in Peru Chile and Argentina and occurs in several protected areas but human poverty levels are high along the coasts and the pelt of one marine otter is worth the same as a month\u2019s wages. With poor law enforcement hunting is an attractive source of income and both a change in public attitude to otters as well as increased law enforcement are necessary in order to slow the decline of this species. Conservation work is becoming more common in South America and it is hoped that this will create a higher level of awareness in the public about the marine otter\u2019s plight (2).,,,,,,,SÌ£o TomÌ© maroon pigeon, SÌ£o TomÌ© olive pigeon, SÌ£o TomÌ© pigeon,Maroon pigeon ,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Columbiformes,Columbidae,Columba (1),Length: 37 ‰ÛÒ 40 cm (2)Male weight: 520 ‰ÛÒ 530 g (2)Female weight: 350 ‰ÛÒ 352 g (2),On the island of S\xe3o Tom\xe9 large areas of forest have been cleared for coffee and cocoa plantations. Today remaining <strong>primary</strong> and <strong>secondary forest</strong> continue to be cleared for cultivation timber and fuelwood (5). This habitat destruction has greatly reduced the range of the maroon pigeon and continues to force it into an ever decreasing area of montane forest (2). Coupled with the impact of habitat loss is the ever-present threat of hunting. Their docile nature makes them an easy target and they are also lured closer by fires lit by hunters (2). The maroon pigeon\u2019s extinction on Rolas shows how such threats can impact on the species and gives a grim insight of what may happen on S\xe3o Tom\xe9 if action is not taken.,Strict protection of the maroon pigeon and its remaining habitat is vital if this species is to survive (4). Protected zones of <strong>primary</strong> forest and the establishment of a National Park on S\xe3o Tom\xe9 have been proposed (6) and a new law regarding the protection of areas and threatened species awaits ratification (5). It is hoped that these essential measures are implemented before the attractive maroon pigeon no longer adorns the forests of S\xe3o Tom\xe9.,,,,,,,,Upe,Marquesan imperial-pigeon ,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Columbiformes,Columbidae,Ducula (1),Length: 50 ‰ÛÒ 55 cm (2)Wingspan: 70 ‰ÛÒ 75 cm (2),The main threats to the Marquesan imperial pigeon are illegal hunting habitat loss and modification predation and competition (3) (4). Habitat has been degraded throughout a long period of Polynesian occupancy through clearance for settlements agriculture and forestry fire regimes introduced vegetation and importation of mammalian herbivores including grazing feral stock although cattle have now been eradicated and goats and pigs are decreasing in number (3) (4). It is feared that construction of new roads may lead not only to further habitat loss but also to greater access and considerable disturbance to the last few remaining inaccessible refuges (3). Introduced predators such as cats and rats particularly black rats (<i>Rattus rattus</i>) are also thought to pose a serious potential threat to eggs nestlings juveniles and adults (3) (4). In addition black rats compete for fruit reducing the available food supply for the Marquesan imperial-pigeon (4).,The Marquesan imperial-pigeon is revered in local culture and hunting is prohibited although it clearly continues illegally (3). Fortunately campaigns to increase awareness of this species\u2019 plight appear to be reducing hunting pressure. In addition lobbying by the Ornithological Society of Polynesia (MANU) has successfully stopped the development of a new road and tunnel project that would have claimed parts of this species\u2019 habitat. As a result of these actions the population on Nuku Hiva appears to be stable and may possibly be showing a slow increase (1) (3).,,,,,,,,,,Marsilea aegyptiaca, Marsilea strigosa,Marsilea ,Plantae,Polypodiophyta,Polypodiopsida,Marsileales,Marsileaceae,Marsilea (1),Marsilea (1),[],[],,,,,,,,,Scinque du maquis Maruia,Maruia maquis skink ,Animalia,Chordata,Reptilia,Squamata,Scincidae,Lioscincus (1),Lioscincus (1),[],[],,,,,,,,,,marvelous spatuletail,Marvellous spatuletail ,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Apodiformes,Trochilidae,Loddigesia (1),Length: 10 - 15 cm (2),A major threat to the marvellous spatuletail and to many other species in South America and elsewhere is deforestation. The rate of deforestation has increased dramatically in recent decades with a study carried out in 1994 finding that the forests around the R\xedo Utcubamba were being cleared for cash crops and for timber (10). However scientists believe that the marvellous spatuletail may be protected somewhat from deforestation as it lives on the edge of forests and in isolated habitats on steep slopes (2) (7).,In order to conserve this beautiful species of hummingbird as well as other wildlife <strong>endemic</strong> to the region the Huembo Visitor Centre was set up in Pomacochas in the Utcubamba Valley of Peru (2) (12). At the Centre the marvellous spatuletails can be seen at the hummingbird feeding stations year-round (12).,,,,,,,,,,Kinabalu flying frog,Masked tree frog ,Animalia,Chordata,Amphibia,Anura,Rhacophoridae,Rhacophorus (1),Rhacophorus (1),[],[],,,,,,,,,,Sichuan hongshan,Masters larch ,Plantae,Tracheophyta,Coniferopsida,Coniferales,Pinaceae,Larix (1),Larix (1),[],[],,,,,,,,,,Matinan blue flycatcher, Sanford's niltava,Matinan flycatcher ,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Muscicapidae,Cyornis (1),Cyornis (1),[],[],,,,,,,,,Dedo,Matisia ,Plantae,Tracheophyta,Magnoliopsida,Malvales,Bombacaceae,Matisia (1),Matisia (1),[],[],,,,,,,,,,Molinillo,Matisia ,Plantae,Tracheophyta,Magnoliopsida,Malvales,Bombacaceae,Matisia (1),Matisia (1),[],[],,,,,,,,,,Maui ‰Û÷alauahio, Maui creeper,Maui alauahio ,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Fringillidae,Paroreomyza (1),Paroreomyza (1),[],[],,,,,,,,,Greater Mascarene flying fox, Mauritan flying fox, Mauritius fruit bat,Mauritian flying fox ,Animalia,Chordata,Mammalia,Chiroptera,Pteropodidae,Pteropus (1),Wingspan: 80 cm (2)Forearm length: 14.3 - 16.5 cm (3)Female weight: 380 - 540 g (3),The Mauritian flying fox is threatened by ongoing habitat loss in the form of deforestation (1) (3). Only an estimated five percent of the original vegetation of Mauritius still survives (9) and over half the plants the Mauritian flying fox now feeds on are introduced species (3). The Mauritian flying fox is also hunted for food and sport despite being legally protected (1) (3) (7). <i>Pteropus</i> species reproduce relatively slowly reducing the rate at which populations can recover from any losses (6) and the limited range of the Mauritian flying fox makes it particularly vulnerable to catastrophic events. In particular habitat loss as well as opening up the forest to hunters compounds the threat from cyclones which can sweep bats from roosts and devastate vegetation leaving little food for survivors. These effects can be particularly severe where habitat is limited or of poor quality and where bat populations are already under pressure (6) (7) (8).,The Mauritian flying fox has been officially protected in Mauritius since 1993 and is reported to occur in a number of protected areas including the Black River Gorges National Park (1) (8). The species is also protected under wildlife regulations in R\xe9union (7) and international trade in Mauritian flying foxes should be controlled under its listing on Appendix II of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) (4). However in addition to culling illegal hunting is still reported to occur (1).,,,,,,,,Cardinal de Maurice, Foudi de l'Ile Maurice,Mauritius fody ,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Ploceidae,Foudia (1),Length: 14 cm (2),Although threatened by the clearance of upland forest the Mauritius fody has also been suddenly lost from areas of intact habitat (2). It is thought that these regions have been affected by particularly high levels of egg predation by both the black rat (<i>Rattus rattus</i>) and the crab-eating macaque (<i>Macaca fascicularis</i>) (6).,At present it would be impossible to eliminate all rats and macaques from the whole of Mauritius and therefore conservation efforts have focussed on establishing populations on offshore predator-free islands (3). The release of captive-bred individuals onto the predator\u2013free island of Ile aux Aigrettes in 2003 has proved successful with the population which is provided with supplementary food increasing to 151 individuals by July 2008 (3). Other conservation measures in place to help protect the Mauritius fody include restoring native forests and establishing plantations of non-invasive exotic trees such as Japanese red cedar (<i>Cryptomeria japonica</i>) which mammalian predators appear to avoid (7).,,,,,,,,,Echo parakeet,Mauritius parakeet ,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Psittaciformes,Psittacidae,Psittacula (1),Length: 35 - 42 cm (2)Male weight: 150 g (2)Female weight: 170 g (2),Much of the natural heritage of Mauritius has been lost and the parakeet itself teetered on the brink of extinction towards the end of the 20th Century. In 1986 only three females were known in the wild and the population as a whole numbered between 8 and 12 birds (4). Much of the native habitat of the island has been destroyed and remaining pockets are vulnerable to storm damage (5). The Mauritius parakeet relies completely on native fauna for both food and nest sites and has been devastated by this habitat decline (4). In addition the introduction of predators such as the crab-eating macaque (<i>Macaca fascicularis</i>) and the black rat (<i>Rattus rattus</i>) has further affected population numbers (5).,The population of Mauritius parakeets today is steadily increasing; in January 2000 the wild population stood at 106 to 126 birds and it is continuing to rise (2) with an estimated 343 wild birds at the end of 2007 (1). This has resulted in the World Conservation Union (IUCN) downlisting the Mauritius parakeet from Critically Endangered to Endangered in 2007 (1). This remarkable achievement has come about by the concerted conservation efforts of a broad-based initiative run in collaboration with the Mauritius Wildlife Foundation (6) Durrell Wildlife Conservation Trust (4) the World Parrot Trust (7) and the Wildlife Preservation Trust of Canada (2). Areas of remaining habitat have been protected and restored by removing introduced plants and animals; Black River National Park has been established to protect the majority of the wild population and is the first national park to be created in Mauritius (4). The breeding success of wild birds has been increased through programmes that supplement their diet and provide a greater number of nesting sites. In addition captive-reared birds are now being released into the wild to bolster numbers (5). This is a wonderful example of how concerted conservation effort can slow the loss of our world\u2019s biodiversity.,,,,,,,,,,Cachorrito Gigante,Maya pupfish ,Animalia,Chordata,Actinopterygii,Cyprinodontiformes,Cyprinodontidae,Cyprinodon (1),Cyprinodon (1),[],[],,,,,,,,,,Aromobates mayorgai, Colostethus mayorgai,Mayorga rocket frog ,Animalia,Chordata,Amphibia,Anura,Dendrobatidae,Nephelobates (1),Nephelobates (1),[],[],,,,,,,,,Mcdonalds rainforest frog, southern nursery-frog,McDonald‰Ûªs frog ,Animalia,Chordata,Amphibia,Anura,Microhylidae,Cophixalus (1),Cophixalus (1),[],[],,,,,,,,,Canard de Meller,Meller‰Ûªs duck ,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Anseriformes,Anatidae,Anas (1),Length: 55 ‰ÛÒ 68 cm (2),The wetland habitats of Madagascar on which this duck depends have suffered widespread modification since humans arrived on the island around 1500 years ago (5). Deforestation of the surrounding lands has increased siltation in the rivers and lakes which along with drainage pollution the conversion of marshes to rice-paddies and the introduction of exotic plants and fishes has resulted in the reduction of Madagascar\u2019s native wetland inhabitants (5). Introduced large fish such as largemouth bass and snakehead are thought to have led to the Meller\u2019s duck deserting some areas (4). The enormous impact these threats could potentially have on Meller\u2019s ducks is illustrated by the plight of two waterbirds that once occurred in Lake Alaotra: the now extinct Delacour's grebe (<i>Tachybaptus rufolavatus</i>) and the recently re-discovered Madagascar pochard (<i>Aythya innotata</i>) (5) (6). Compounding the threat of habitat loss and degradation is hunting; around 450 ducks are killed each year from Lake Alaotra for food which constitutes an incredible 18 percent of the global population (2).,Meller\u2019s duck occurs in at least seven protected areas in Madagascar (2) and there are some laws in place to control hunting of this species. However these laws are often not enforced and hunting of this endangered bird continues (3). A captive population of Meller\u2019s ducks exists at Durrell Wildlife Conservation Trust Jersey where over 150 young have been successfully reared. This population not only acts as a safeguard should the species become extinct in the wild but it also allows extensive research to be undertaken gaining valuable information which may be used to formulate a conservation plan for the wild population (3). In the wild improved enforcement of hunting regulations and the development of protected areas that incorporate nesting sites are considered essential actions to ensure the survival of Meller\u2019s duck (4) (5).,,,,,,,,,,long-tailed langur, Mentawai leaf monkey,Mentawai langur ,Animalia,Chordata,Mammalia,Primates,Cercopithecidae,Presbytis (1),Presbytis (1),[],[],,,,,,,,,Mentawai archipelago Leopoldamys,Mentawai long-tailed giant rat ,Animalia,Chordata,Mammalia,Rodentia,Muridae,Leopoldamys (1),Leopoldamys (1),[],[],,,,,,,,,,Hyla labialis meridensis, Hyla meridensis, Hyla vilsoniana meridensis,Merida tree frog ,Animalia,Chordata,Amphibia,Anura,Hylidae,Dendropsophus (1),Dendropsophus (1),[],[],,,,,,,,Bufo mertensi, Bufo mertensiana, Werneria preussi mertensiana,Mertens‰Ûª smalltongue toad ,Animalia,Chordata,Amphibia,Anura,Bufonidae,Werneria (1),Werneria (1),[],[],,,,,,,,Cynanchum spruceanum,Metastelma ,Plantae,Tracheophyta,Magnoliopsida,Gentianales,Asclepiadaceae,Metastelma (1),Metastelma (1),[],[],,,,,,,,,,Barlia metlesicsiana,Metlesics' himantoglossum ,Plantae,Tracheophyta,Liliopsida,Orchidales,Orchidaceae,Himantoglossum (1),Himantoglossum (1),[],[],,,,,,,,,,Bagre de Muzquiz,Mexican blindcat ,Animalia,Chordata,Actinopterygii,Siluriformes,Ictaluridae,Prietella (1),Length: up to 9.2 cm (2),The Mexican blindcat is considered by the World Conservation Union (IUCN) to be Endangered due to its restricted range and an inferred population decline (1).  The region in Mexico the blindcat inhabits is facing rapid population growth resulting in increased pressure on groundwater resources.  Interviews with local people indicate that the water tables have declined in recent decades which reduces the amount of available habitat for the Mexican blindcat.  Growing human populations also results in increased pollution which could contaminate the groundwater (6) further threatening the existence of this fish.,Despite the threats it faces the Mexican blindcat may inhabit underground waters that are undiscovered or inaccessible to humans and therefore the total number of individuals could potentially be large (6).  Further research to determine the population size and conservation status of the Mexican blindcat is required to inform future conservation actions to protect this peculiar species.,,,,,,,,,,big long-nosed bat, greater long-nosed bat,Mexican long-nosed bat ,Animalia,Chordata,Mammalia,Chiroptera,Phyllostomidae,Leptonycteris (1),18 - 30 g (2) (3),The Mexican long-nosed bat has undergone a major population decline in recent years (1) (3) (6) and several caves in Mexico that once contained large numbers of bats now contain only small numbers or none at all (1) (6) (9). The main threat to the species is believed to come from a decrease in its food supply due to habitat clearance and the exploitation of agaves for the production of alcoholic drinks such as tequila (1) (3) (6) (9) (10). This harvest poses a particular threat as the agaves are harvested just before blooming preventing the plant from flowering and since agaves grow for 10 to 20 years flower only once and then die it can also prevent the agaves from reproducing (1) (6). The Mexican long-nosed bat\u2019s dependence on a continuous supply of food plants along its migratory routes also means that loss of the plants in any single area could have negative consequences for this species\xa0(9).,The only known <strong>colonial</strong> roosting site of the Mexican long-nosed bat in the United States is protected within the Big Bend National Park Texas (1) (3) (6) and the species is listed as Endangered on the US Endangered Species List (11). A Recovery Plan is in place for the species (10) and recommendations for its conservation include the protection of roost sites and foraging habitat public education ecological studies maintaining and restoring habitat and food plants along its migratory routes and population monitoring (1) (3) (6) (10). Efforts are also underway to locate further roosting sites (6). In Mexico two caves are proposed for protection in Tamaulipas and the species is also included in a collaborative Program for the Conservation of Migratory Bats of Mexico and the USA which is undertaking a range of conservation activities (3).,,,,,,,,,Ophryacus melanurus, Porthidium melanurum,Mexican pitviper ,Animalia,Chordata,Reptilia,Squamata,Viperidae,Mixcoatlus (1),Mixcoatlus (1),[],[],,,,,,,,,Mexican prairie marmot,Mexican prairie dog ,Animalia,Chordata,Mammalia,Rodentia,Sciuridae,Cynomys (1),Total length: 39 cm (2)Tail length: 9 cm (2)Male weight: 1.2 kg (2)Female weight: 0.9 kg (2),The main threat facing this species has been loss of suitable habitat as a result of expansion of agriculture and livestock farming (1). As the species is often perceived as an agricultural pest Mexican prairie dog towns have been exterminated by deliberate poisoning despite the fact that the species is fully protected against deliberate killing by Mexican law (5). The species has also been hunted for food in the past (4).,The Mexican prairie dog is classified as Endangered by the IUCN Red List 2003 and is protected against international trade by its listing under Appendix I of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) (1) (3). <i>Protecion de la Fauna Mexicana </i>recently carried out a conservation project targeted at the Mexican prairie dog funded by <i>Fondo Mexicano para la Conservacion de la Naturaleza Mexico. </i>This project set aside 114 hectares of prairie dog colony to be protected and managed in ways that benefit the species. In parallel an environmental education programme was carried out in the area to spread the word of the importance of the species and its perilous status. Essential research into pasture management techniques that are compatible with the survival of this species was undertaken during the project. The only hope for the survival of the Mexican prairie dog is that methods can be found to reconcile cattle-keeping and the native fauna of the area (6).,,,,,,,,,,Lineatriton lineolus, Pseudoeurycea lineolus,Mexican slender salamander ,Animalia,Chordata,Amphibia,Caudata,Plethodontidae,Pseudoeurycea (1),Pseudoeurycea (1),[],[],,,,,,,,,Ciprecillo Colorado, CiprÌ©s Colorado, Granadillo, Pinabete Colorado, Tejo Mexicano,Mexican yew ,Plantae,Tracheophyta,Coniferopsida,Coniferales,Taxaceae,Taxus (1),Taxus (1),[],[],,,,,,Propithecus diadema edwardsi, Propithecus holomelas,Milne-Edwards' sifaka ,Animalia,Chordata,Mammalia,Primates,Indriidae,Propithecus (1),5 ‰ÛÒ 6.5 kg (2),<strong>Slash-and-burn</strong> agriculture a common practice in Madagascar alongside logging poses the greatest threat to the survival of Milne-Edwards\u2019 sifaka by destroying its rainforest habitat. Regrettably such activities even take place within so-called protected areas (1).\xa0 Both gold mining and illegal rum production are also degrading suitable habitat in certain parts of the sifaka\u2019s range (1). Compounding the threat of habitat loss is the threat of hunting; being a large lemur it is an attractive target for hunters.

The Minor\u2019s chameleon is currently listed in Appendix II of CITES limiting trade in this species (3). Generally the greatest threat to Madagascar\u2019s chameleons is considered to be habitat loss as primary vegetation is cleared for conversion to subsistence agriculture (1) but Minor\u2019s chameleon fortunately appears to tolerate disturbed environments better than most other species (4). However due to a lack of basic information in its ecology we do not know whether plantations provide suitable breeding habitats. This lack of knowledge and its relatively restricted range in terms of habitat and elevation and use of native forest make it a species worthy of conservation concern (1).,As with most other Madagascan <em>Furcifer</em> chameleon species Minor\u2019s chameleon was banned from export in 1994 (7).

Small populations restricted to tiny areas are always incredibly vulnerable to the impacts of any threats that may befall them. The most immediate threat the Narcondam hornbill faces is habitat deterioration (2). In 1969 a small police outpost was established on the island leading to the loss of forest to create the post a plantation of fruit trees and vegetable plots (2) (7) and further trees are cut each year for firewood and intermittent maintenance purposes (7). Goats were also introduced to the island and their grazing has now eliminated most of the undergrowth and seedlings (2) significantly reducing natural forest regeneration (7). Feral cats also introduced are now abundant but their impact on the Narcondam hornbill is not yet known (2) and around 25 to 40 Narcondam hornbills are thought to be hunted each year although this is not believed to be a serious threat given the rate of breeding (2) (7). Nature brings its own problems for the Narcondam hornbill; the small restricted population is susceptible to both disease and natural disasters such as cyclones which can fell large and important nesting trees (7).,Narcondam Island has been declared a wildlife sanctuary and the police personnel on the island have been given strict instructions not to hunt the threatened hornbill (7). However to ensure the long-term survival of the Narcondam hornbill stricter conservation measures are required. As a priority all introduced species especially goats should be removed from the island (2) and cooking fuel should be provided to the island\u2019s inhabitants to eliminate their need for fuelwood (7).

The behaviour of massing in predictably located <strong>spawning</strong> aggregations has meant that these fish are easy targets caught by hook and line traps and spearguns (6). In the 1990s however fisheries documented a worrying decline in the size of catches and aggregations are no longer observed in Puerto Rico Bermuda or the United States Virgin Islands (3).,Following a massive lobbying effort by conservationists the Nassau grouper has finally received some of the protection it requires if numbers are going to recover from past exploitation (3). <strong>Spawning</strong> sites are protected in the Cayman Islands and fishing is banned in Belize during the spawning season (1). Other countries in the area however have been slow to introduce protection measures and extensive lobbying continues (1).,,,,,,,,,,Bois Doux Avocat, Bois Doux Jaune, Laurier Gland,Nectandra ,Plantae,Tracheophyta,Magnoliopsida,Laurales,Lauraceae,Nectandra (1),Nectandra (1),[],[],,,,,,,,Negros striped babbler, Negros tree-babbler,Negros striped-babbler ,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Timaliidae,Stachyris (1),Stachyris (1),[],[],,,,,,,,,San Joaquin antelope ground squirrel, San Joaquin antelope squirrel,Nelson's antelope squirrel ,Animalia,Chordata,Mammalia,Rodentia,Sciuridae,Ammospermophilus (1),142 ‰ÛÒ 179 g (2),The principal reason behind the dramatic decline of Nelson\u2019s antelope squirrel is the loss of its habitat to agricultural encroachment urbanisation overgrazing by livestock and oil and gas exploration. Now present in only 20 percent of its former range Nelson\u2019s antelope squirrel is extremely vulnerable to further habitat loss. In public owned reserves this rare species is protected from further declines but in private owned areas where the future management is uncertain its habitat is still threatened. The use of insecticides on agricultural pests has also been identified as a further threat to Nelson\u2019s antelope squirrel due to loss of prey while the historical use of rodenticides for the control of ground squirrels may have also contributed to the decline (1) (6). \xa0,Nelson\u2019s antelope squirrel has already benefited from several conservation measures aiming to protect its vulnerable habitat.\xa0 Several reserves have been created within the San Joaquin valley an area defined by a high degree of <strong>endemism</strong> including the Carrizo Plain National Monument and the Elkhorn Plain Ecological Preserve. This has offered Nelson\u2019s antelope squirrel some sanctuary; however several sites with substantial populations still receive no form of protection. Foremost in the drive to save this species should be the establishment of further protected areas in the Panoche and Kettleman hills and on the San Joaquin valley floor (1). Furthermore livestock grazing of natural grasslands should be limited while further surveys and monitoring of the density of this curious species is also required (6).,,,,,,,,,red-breasted dotterel, red-breasted plover,New Zealand dotterel ,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Charadriiformes,Charadriidae,Charadrius (1),130 - 170 g (3),Extinction of the New Zealand dotterel on the South Island was primarily caused by introduced predators (4) with the principle predators being hedgehogs stoats weasels gulls hawks rats cats and dogs (2). Feral cats and rats caused a rapid decline on Stewart Island (4) (5) and predation remains the greatest threat on the North Island (4). Habitat loss and human disturbance during breeding have also had a dramatic impact on populations and continue to pose serious threats (3). In particular housing industrial and tourism developments on the North Island combined with encroachment of dune-stabilising weeds have reduced habitat (4). Growing recreational use of the coastline is also set to increasingly impact on breeding roosting and feeding habitats (5). Indeed four-wheel drive vehicles picnickers and dogs can trample and disturb nests or draw defensive adults away from incubating their eggs (2). Additionally storms and very high tides can destroy nests (4) (6) and very few young survive to fledging age (2).,In 1993 the New Zealand Government\u2019s Department of Conservation published a national recovery plan for the New Zealand dotterel and management initiatives were implemented (3). On the North Island trapping of potential predators gull control and the implementation of signs and wardens to reduce human disturbance have all helped improve breeding success (4). Control of cats and rodents in four important breeding sites on Stewart Island has also helped increase survival in southern New Zealand dotterel populations which thankfully appear to be growing (4) (5). Captive breeding trials with the more abundant northern New Zealand dotterel have been undertaken partially as an experiment to see if individuals breed well in case such a programme should be needed in the future to bolster the low numbers of wild southern New Zealand dotterels. Chicks have been raised successfully in these trials highlighting captive breeding as a viable means of preserving the survival of the species should such methods ever be needed (4).,,,,,,,,,‰Û÷A‰Ûªo,Newell‰Ûªs shearwater ,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Procellariiformes,Procellariidae,Puffinus (1),Length: 33 cm (2)Male weight: 389 ‰ÛÒ 425 g (2)Female weight: 343 ‰ÛÒ 422 g (2),Since 1992 numbers of Newell\u2019s shearwaters on Kaua\u2019i have been declining. Although this decline is thought to be associated with the impacts of Hurricane Iniki which hit the island in 1992 numerous other factors could also be implicated. Artificial lighting on the breeding islands such as street and resort lights is affecting large numbers of Newell\u2019s shearwaters. Lights disorientate fledglings as they depart the island for life at sea causing them to crash into powerlines communication towers or other structures or fall to the ground exhausted. Once on the ground the small birds are vulnerable to cars cats dogs starvation and dehydration resulting in thousands perishing each year (4).,Several conservation actions have been initiated for this Endangered bird. In 1978 a campaign to rescue and rehabilitate fallen fledglings began (4). Entitled Save our Shearwaters this campaign recovers and releases around 1500 disorientated shearwaters each year (2) (4). Since the early 1980s efforts have been made to reduce the amount of glaring lights that attract and disorientate shearwaters (4). In 2006 a law was passed which requires all non-essential lights to be turned off or shielded between September and December on Kaua\u2019i when young shearwaters leave their nests (6) and recently hoods (to prevent lights shining into the sky) have been installed on all lights on the island (4).,,,,,,,,,,Nicobar tree shrew,Nicobar treeshrew ,Animalia,Chordata,Mammalia,Scandentia,Tupaiidae,Tupaia (1),Tupaia (1),[],[],,,,,,,,,,pyramid Barb,Nilgiri barb ,Animalia,Chordata,Actinopterygii,Cypriniformes,Cyprinidae,Hypselobarbus (1),Hypselobarbus (1),[],[],,,,,,,,,,white-bellied shortwing,Nilgiri blue robin ,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Muscicapidae,Myiomela (1),Length: 15 cm (2),Numbers of the Nilgiri blue robin have dwindled with the conversion of <strong>primary forest</strong> to plantations crops and human settlements (5) while hydroelectric power development and road-building continue to cause the destruction of essential habitat throughout its range. As the Nilgiri blue robin is already living close to the maximum altitudes at which it is able to survive climate change also has the potential to negatively impact populations of the Nilgiri blue robin (2).,The Nilgiri blue robin is found in Mukurthi National Park. Proposed conservation measures for this threatened bird include regular monitoring of remaining populations and campaigning for a moratorium on the conversion on natural forest to plantations in the Nilgiris (2) while efforts are also underway to restore forest in some areas of the Nilgiri blue robin\u2019s range and to promote community-based conservation initiatives (2) (3). These efforts will not only benefit this vulnerable bird but also many other inhabitants of the Western Ghats.\xa0\xa0,,,,,,,,,,Rana nilagirica,Nilgiri frog ,Animalia,Chordata,Amphibia,Anura,Dicroglossidae,Fejervarya (1),Fejervarya (1),[],[],,,,,,,,,,Nilgiri ibex,Nilgiri tahr ,Animalia,Chordata,Mammalia,Cetartiodactyla,Bovidae,Nilgiritragus (1),Male weight: 80 - 100 kg (2)Shoulder height: 100 cm (2),The precise distribution of this species in the past is not well documented but the range and numbers of these goat antelope were more widespread than they are today (2). Habitat destruction and sport hunting especially by European colonists have decimated tahr numbers (2). The Nilgiri tahr is now fully protected in India but poaching remains a threat today (2).,The Nilgiri tahr has increased in numbers in recent decades thanks to strict protection within one of India's most effective National Parks; Eravikulam National Park was established in 1978 and covers around 97 square kilometres (2). The area was declared as a sanctuary in 1975 and subsequently elevated to the status of a National Park in 1978 taking into consideration the importance of the area in terms of conservation (4). The 2003 census of the park recorded 750 individuals (4). Current conservation objectives include further study of the ecology and behaviour of this fascinating goat antelope and the investigation of the possibility of <strong>re-introductions</strong> (2). Within the Eravikulam National Park and the grasslands of the Tamil Nadu the Niligiri tahr may have a relatively secure future but elsewhere in the Western Ghats populations are extremely fragmented and highly vulnerable (4).,,,,,,,,,,Pygmy otter-shrew,Nimba otter shrew ,Animalia,Chordata,Mammalia,Afrosoricida,Tenrecidae,Micropotamogale (1),Micropotamogale (1),[],[],,,,,,,,,,Hylarana asperrima, Rana asperrima,Nkongsamba frog ,Animalia,Chordata,Amphibia,Anura,Ranidae,Amnirana (1),Amnirana (1),[],[],,,,,,,,,Kauai Cave wolf spider,No-eyed big-eyed wolf spider ,Animalia,Arthropoda,Arachnida,Araneae,Lycosidae,Adelocosa (1),Adelocosa (1),[],[],,,,,,,,,,Bufo noellerti,Noellert‰Ûªs toad ,Animalia,Chordata,Amphibia,Anura,Bufonidae,Duttaphrynus (1),Duttaphrynus (1),[],[],,,,,,,,,,Spotted greenshank,Nordmann‰Ûªs greenshank ,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Charadriiformes,Scolopacidae,Tringa (1),Length: 29 ‰ÛÒ 32 cm (2),The major threats to this species include the development of coastal wetlands for industry and aquaculture and habitat degradation due to grazing reindeer in Russia as well as pollution. Hunting and human disturbance have also contributed to population declines (2).,This species benefits from protection in several areas in Russia as well as from protected and non-hunting areas along the migration route including the Yellow River Delta Yancheng and Chongming Dongtan in China Mai Po in Hong Kong Ko Libong in Thailand Peam Krasop in Cambodia and Zuan Thuy in Vietnam. Surveys are planned for the southwest of Okhotsk as well as between the Ul\u2019beya River and Cape Onatsevich Russia. Further research into the status and necessary conservation actions is needed at potentially important wintering grounds in the Ayeyarwady Delta (formerly Irrawaddy) in Burma. Key actions to be completed also include the promotion of the conservation of coastal wetlands the prohibition of hunting of all shorebirds in the breeding grounds of Nordmann\u2019s greenshank and full legal protection throughout its range (2).,,,,,,,,,,Baleine De Biscaye, Baleine Des Basques,North Atlantic right whale ,Animalia,Chordata,Mammalia,Cetartiodactyla,Balaenidae,Eubalaena (1),up to 70 tonnes (3),With as of 2008 between just 300 and 350 North Atlantic right whales remaining this species\u2019 existence lies in an extremely precarious situation (1). Years of whaling starting in the 11th century and becoming a modern industrial practice in the early 20th century have left North Atlantic right whale stocks seriously depleted in the western Atlantic (2) and virtually extinct in the eastern Atlantic (1). They were killed in their thousands for their valuable oil and <strong>baleen</strong> (2) until commercial whaling was prohibited by the International Whaling Commission in 1935 (1).,Since the North Atlantic right whale was protected from hunting in 1935 by the International Whaling Commission (IWC) and also protected in Canada which is not a member of the IWC (1) the most important conservation need for this species is the reduction or elimination of deaths and injuries from ship collisions and entanglement in fishing gear (3).,,,,,,,,,lamprehuela, VerdemÌ£ do Norte,Northern Iberian spined-loach ,Animalia,Chordata,Actinopterygii,Cypriniformes,Cobitidae,Cobitis (1),Length: up to 8.2 cm (2),The Northern Iberian spined-loach has declined in abundance and range in recent decades and has now disappeared from parts of the Duero and Ebro rivers with remaining populations also becoming more fragmented. The main threats to the species include gravel and water extraction water pollution dam construction the destruction of <strong>spawning</strong> areas and the introduction of exotic fish such as pike (<em>Esox lucius</em>) which may act as predators competitors or vectors of disease (1) (2) (3) (6) (7).,The Northern Iberian spined-loach is listed as Vulnerable in the Spanish Red Book (3) and as Endangered in the Portuguese Red Book (7). It is also listed on Annex III of the Convention on the Conservation of European Wildlife and Natural Habitats (Bern Convention) (11).,,,,,,,,,Pinto abalone,Northern abalone ,Animalia,Mollusca,Gastropoda,Archaeogastropoda,Haliotidae,Haliotis (1),Length: up to 14 cm (2),Abalone have been harvested for hundreds of years for their meat and their decorative shells but their remote environment previously limited the impact this had on populations (2) (3). However the introduction of SCUBA equipment in the 1960s meant that abalone could be collected in far greater numbers and led to the rampant over-harvesting and drastic decline of this species to the extent that collecting this species was eventually banned over much of its range (2) (5). However illegal poaching which is a lucrative enterprise motivated by high demand and elevated market prices due to the species\u2019 scarcity continues to pose a serious threat to the northern abalone (3). Furthermore there are law enforcement problems due to North America having large areas of uninhabited coastline in which constant monitoring is near impossible (1).,There are now a number of conservation measures underway to protect the northern abalone. A total ban on harvesting this species came into force in 1990 in British Columbia and partial bans and catch quotas now also exist elsewhere. A National Recovery Strategy and National Recovery Action Plan have been created in Canada which focus on improving law enforcement raising public support through communication campaigns conducting further research on the species and ongoing monitoring of its status and population trends. Although supplementing northern abalone populations could help accelerate its recovery reintroductions of hatchery-raised juveniles has proved costly and fairly ineffective in the past and therefore is not recommended as a valuable conservation tool in this instance (1).,,,,,,,,,,Helmeted curassow,Northern helmeted curassow ,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Galliformes,Cracidae,Pauxi (1),Length: 91 cm (2),The northern helmeted curassow has undergone a relatively rapid decline as the result of indiscriminate hunting and long-term destruction fragmentation and alteration of its habitat (2). Sadly wherever curassows occur they tend to be considered prime game species due to their large size and succulent flesh (4). This species has also at least formerly been illegally hunted for use of its bony casque to make traditional jewellery (2) (6).\xa0Essential forest habitat has been destroyed in both Venezuela and Colombia for conversion into cattle ranches at lower altitudes and for narcotics cultivation higher up (2). Furthermore opening up of forest habitat to human development only serves to increase the bird\u2019s vulnerability to the pressures of hunting and the limited range and low reproductive rate of this species only compound such threats (4).,Almost all remaining forests in northern Venezuela are now legally protected and records of this rare bird exist from 18 national parks but this has failed to safeguard it from the threat of poachers which continue to illegally hunt it within these areas (2) (6). The situation is worse in Colombia with the species being recorded within only one \u2018protected area\u2019 El Cocuy National Park Arauca which is also ineffectively protected (2). This rare curassow is legally protected in Venezuela and an education programme has been established to raise awareness of the plight of the bird and its habitat (2). Captive breeding and reintroduction of the bird have also been proposed for Venezuela as a means of restoring natural populations where they have declined (2) (7). However until legislation against hunting is strictly enforced and national parks are adequately protected reintroduced individuals may have a poor chance of survival. Thus conservation efforts should focus on protecting existing populations and the ever diminishing habitat on which they rely.,,,,,,,,,,Satanellus hallucatus,Northern quoll ,Animalia,Chordata,Mammalia,Dasyuromorphia,Dasyuridae,Dasyurus (1),Dasyurus (1),[],[],,,,,,,,,,Diomedea epomophora sanfordi,Northern royal albatross ,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Procellariiformes,Diomedeidae,Diomedea (1),Size (beak to tail): 1.15 m (2)Wingspan: up to 3.2 m (3),A storm that hit the Chatham Islands in 1985 had a dramatic impact on the reproductive success of the northern royal albatross reducing soil cover and destroying all vegetation so that nests had to be constructed with stones or eggs simply laid on bare rock. As a result annual reproductive success plummeted due to egg breakage high temperatures and flooding in temporary pools. Introduced predators pose an additional threat with stoats (<i>Mustela erminea</i>) and cats known to take eggs and chicks at Taiaroa Head. Albatrosses are notoriously vulnerable to becoming entangled in fishing equipment whilst feeding on baited hooks or catch and mortality due to longline fishing activities may pose a future threat to this species (2).,All populations of the northern royal albatross are monitored annually and predator control initiatives at Taiaroa Head during the breeding season have dramatically improved annual reproductive success rates. Feral cattle rabbits and mice have all been eradicated from Enderby Island and Taiaroa Head and Enderby Island are established as nature reserves (2). The northern royal albatross is also listed on Annex 1 of the Agreement on the Conservation of Albatrosses and Petrels (ACAP) a multilateral agreement which seeks to conserve albatrosses and petrels by coordinating international activity to mitigate known threats to these magnificent seabirds (4).,,,,,,,,,,Banded anteater, walpurti,Numbat ,Animalia,Chordata,Mammalia,Dasyuromorphia,Myrmecobiidae,Myrmecobius (1),Male head-body length: 22 ‰ÛÒ 29 cm (2)Female head-body length: 20 ‰ÛÒ 27 cm (2)Male tail length: 12 ‰ÛÒ 21 cm (2)Female tail length: 14 ‰ÛÒ 22 cm (2)Male weight: 405 ‰ÛÒ 752 g (2)Female weight: 305 ‰ÛÒ 647 g (2),The numbat\u2019s populations have dramatically suffered from predation by introduced mammals such as the cat and red fox (<i>Vulpes vulpes</i>) (4) (7) and the clearing of the land for agriculture. This removes dead and fallen trees which numbats need for shelter and termites need for resources (4). Another factor could be the suppression of Aboriginal fire regimes after the movement of Aboriginal people away from their traditional lands following the European settlement of Australia. Aboriginal fires were small and controlled allowing regeneration each year and reducing the incidence of larger bush fires in the hot summer. Now these large bush fires are a greater threat and more widespread causing extensive damage to the numbats\u2019 habitat shelter and food sources (4) (6).,The numbat is Western Australia\u2019s mammal emblem a status which gives it widespread recognition and may well have saved it from extinction (4). Following the numbat\u2019s decline this species has been listed as Vulnerable on the IUCN Red List (1) and Vulnerable on the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 (EPBC Act) (3). Active intervention by the Australian Department of Environment and Conservation (DEC) has fortunately improved the numbat\u2019s chances of survival. DEC has implemented fox control in the areas where numbats are found and is establishing new populations in various nature reserves and forests (5). Conservation programs are also re-introducing the numbat to areas from which they have disappeared and are radio-tracking individuals to monitor their fate (8). Regular fox baiting is also carried out at Perup Dryandra and at re-introduction sites and numbats are currently being bred for release at Perth Zoo (4) (7). The numbat\u2019s habitat is said to be secure at present though this species will certainly need constant protection and continued <strong>re-introductions</strong> in order to recover (5) (8).,,,,,,,,,Ocellatus small treefrog,Ocellated bubble-nest frog ,Animalia,Chordata,Amphibia,Anura,Rhacophoridae,Philautus (1),Philautus (1),[],[],,,,,,,,,,Tororoi de Frente OcrÌÁcea,Ochre-fronted antpitta ,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Formicariidae,Grallaricula (1),22.5 ‰ÛÒ 23.8 g (2),Habitat loss and degradation is likely to pose the greatest threat to the ochre-fronted antpitta due to its presumed restricted range and specific needs. Whilst much of the area in which it inhabits is inaccessible and unexplored in other parts deforestation occurs at an alarmingly high rate as forest is cleared for crops such as marijuana and coffee (5). <strong>Slash-and-burn</strong> agriculture in the area is also increasing catalysed by the recent paving of a highway that traverses the region (6).,The ochre-fronted antpitta has been found near the Alto Mayo Protected Forest (2) but this area is itself critically threatened due to deforestation for agriculture and grazing illegal extraction of wildlife high levels of human migration and indiscriminate hunting (7). The American Bird Conservancy together with Asociaci\xf3n Ecosistemas Andinos (ECOAN) is running a project to conserve threatened birds and other wildlife around Abra Patricia (a site within the antpitta\u2019s range) by establishing a new private reserve and field station (6). In addition it has been proposed that surveys and research of the species should be undertaken along with enforcing the protection of the Alto Mayo Protected Forest and ensuring that high-altitude forest habitat suitable for the antpitta is included within its boundaries (2) (3).,,,,,,,,,,Beni titi monkey, Olalla‰Ûªs titi, Olalla‰Ûªs titi monkey,Olalla Brothers‰Ûª titi ,Animalia,Chordata,Mammalia,Primates,Pitheciidae,Callicebus (1),Callicebus (1),Already restricted in range the Olalla Brothers\u2019 titi is threatened by further habitat loss and hunting (1). Many groups are found in isolated relict forest patches surrounded by cattle ranches and agricultural grasslands limiting the species\u2019 natural dispersal. Hunting pressure also exists throughout its range as some indigenous groups of people still rely on subsistence hunting of primates and its skin and fur may be used to make rope and thread. Hunting is particularly intense during the annual Brazil nut harvest when workers obtain most of their food from hunting (6). The Olalla Brothers\u2019 titi may also be captured for use as bait in fishing and cat hunting or as pets (1).,Although not found in any protected areas the Olalla Brothers\u2019 titi has received some protection from landowners that prohibit hunting on their land. However this endangered monkey is still highly vulnerable to encroaching agriculture and urbanisation and it is imperative that its habitat receives some form of legal protection (1). Thankfully the Wildlife Conservation Society is helping indigenous people to develop sustainable livelihoods and reduce deforestation (8). Other organisations such as Asociaci\xf3n Armon\xeda and Asociaci\xf3n Boliviana para la Conservaci\xf3n are also working to highlight the plight of some of the most vulnerable species in the region (9) (10). Further research into the ecology and distribution of the Olalla Brothers\u2019 titi is urgently required if this species is to escape extinction (5).,,,,,,,,Omei lazy toad,Omei toothed toad ,Animalia,Chordata,Amphibia,Anura,Megophryidae,Oreolalax (1),Oreolalax (1),[],[],,,,,,,,,,Alagoas antwren,Orange-bellied antwren ,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Thamnophilidae,Terenura (1),Terenura (1),[],[],,,,,,,,,,Braun‰Ûªs bush-shrike,Orange-breasted bush-shrike ,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Malaconotidae,Laniarius (1),Length: 20 cm (2),The region of Angola inhabited by the orange-breasted bush-shrike has been subject to steady deforestation in recent decades with an increase in <strong>slash-and-burn</strong> cultivation and the removal of timber trees.  As the orange-breasted bush-shrike is known from only a small area this habitat destruction poses a great threat to the species\u2019 survival (2).,It is possible that the orange-breasted bush-shrike may occur within the Kisama (or Qui\xe7\xe3ma) National Park (2) although even within this supposedly protected area there are continuous problems with illegal cultivation cutting and other pressures from the human population inhabiting the park (5).  There are currently no known conservation measures in place for this Endangered species although it has been recommended that surveys to determine the distribution and population size of the orange-breasted bush-shrike along with assessments of the current extent of forest cover should be undertaken once the civil unrest in Angola subsides (2).,,,,,,,,,,Astatotilapia brevis, Haplochromis brevis,Orange-fringed river bream ,Animalia,Chordata,Actinopterygii,Perciformes,Cichlidae,Chetia (1),Chetia (1),[],[],,,,,,,,,Orbost spiny cray,Orbost spiny crayfish ,Animalia,Arthropoda,Crustacea,Decapoda,Parastacidae,Euastacus (1),Occipital carapace length: up to 3.2 cm (2)Total length: c. 7 - 7.9 cm (3),The Orbost spiny crayfish has a highly fragmented and restricted distribution (1) (4) and is uncommon at the sites it inhabits (1) (5). One of the main threats to this freshwater species is a continuing decline in the quality of its habitat as a result of timber harvesting and forest management activities. Together with associated road building activities timber harvesting can affect water run-off into the streams this crayfish inhabits as well as increasing the amounts of sediment and nutrients washing into the water (1) (4) (5).,There are no specific conservation measures currently aimed at the Orbost spiny crayfish. However it is indirectly protected by fishing restrictions in Victoria which have a minimum crayfish catch size that is greater than the largest individuals of this species (1) (5).,,,,,,,,,,GavilÌÁn Blanco,Oreomunnea ,Plantae,Tracheophyta,Magnoliopsida,Juglandales,Juglandaceae,Oreomunnea (1),Oreomunnea (1),[],[],,,,,,,,,,Oriental stork,Oriental white stork ,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Ciconiiformes,Ciconiidae,Ciconia (1),Length: 100 ‰ÛÒ 115 cm (2),Wetlands around the world have been drained for agricultural development and the habitat of the Oriental white stork is no exception particularly at the breeding sites. In Russia breeding sites are also at risk from spring fires which bring down tall trees suitable for nesting forcing delayed nesting and reduced reproductive success. At the wintering sites in China over-fishing has reduced the availability of prey species for the Oriental white stork. Throughout the range this stork is hunted and collected for zoos despite legal protection (3).,The Oriental white stork is legally protected in Russia Mongolia China North Korea South Korea and Japan. It also benefits from many protected areas in both Russia and China. <strong>Re-introduction</strong> programmes in South Korea and Japan should help to reduce declines but further protected areas are necessary to prevent habitat loss being the cause of this species\u2019 extinction. The maintenance of tall trees and the addition of artificial nest poles in potential breeding areas as well as control of human disturbance at nest sites during the breeding season should also encourage increased breeding success. Further action includes campaigns against the use of fire by farmers in the breeding grounds and against poaching (2).,,,,,,,,,,Sunda Otter Civet,Otter civet ,Animalia,Chordata,Mammalia,Carnivora,Viverridae,Cynogale,Cynogale,[],[],,,,,,,,,,Unio gladiator, Unio micheloti,Oxynaia ,Animalia,Mollusca,Bivalvia,Unionoida,Unionidae,Oxynaia (1),Oxynaia (1),[],[],,,,,,,,,Dysnomia capsaeformis,Oyster mussel ,Animalia,Mollusca,Bivalvia,Unionoida,Unionidae,Epioblasma (1),Length: up to 7 cm (2) (3),Human modifications to streams and rivers have had a serious impact on this once common and widespread mussel. By 2000 the species had undergone an estimated 80 percent population decline and is also now much reduced in range\xa0(1)\xa0(2)\xa0(4). Channel modifications including dams dredging and mining together with pollution sedimentation and water withdrawal all directly threaten the oyster mussel\u2019s habitat\xa0(1)\xa0(2)\xa0(3)\xa0(4) while impoundments such as dams can greatly alter factors such as water flow temperature and oxygen levels as well as presenting barriers to dispersal. Adverse effects on host fish can also indirectly impact the mussel\u2019s reproductive cycle. Large portions of the oyster mussel\u2019s historical range including the entire length of the main Tennessee and Cumberland River channels are now impounded or greatly modified leading to the extirpation of the oyster mussel from many areas\xa0(2)\xa0(3)\xa0(4). The small and fragmented populations that remain are under increased risk from isolated events such as chemical spills or from the potential negative effects of genetic isolation\xa0(4).,In 1997 the oyster mussel was listed as Endangered by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service\xa0(7) and a recovery plan was drawn up for the species\xa0(4). The conservation measures recommended by this plan include the protection of remaining mussel populations and habitat identifying or re-establishing additional populations undertaking further research into the species\u2019 ecology life history and genetic diversity the implementation of a monitoring programme and working to improve habitat quality\xa0(3)\xa0(4).

It is locally abundant and has a high reproductive rate most likely allowing fast recovery from minor reductions in population numbers. Sapphire mining operations near to the habitat of the painted burrowing frog are considered to be a threat to populations and further potential threats include increasing tourist activity and habitat loss from fire wood extraction and over-grazing by livestock (1).,Several populations of the painted burrowing frog occur in the Isalo National Park where the habitat is protected but habitat loss elsewhere is likely and potentially dangerous to the remaining unprotected populations (1).

The area occupied by the Palawan horned frog is now small and severely fragmented which together with the continued decline in the extent and quality of its habitat puts it at particular risk of extinction\xa0(1). Many amphibian species are coming under increasing pressure from factors including climate change and disease (5) but it is not known to what extent these are currently affecting the Palawan horned frog.,The Palawan horned frog is found in several protected areas although water pollution may still impact the species within these.

The Panay bushy-tailed cloud rat has been bred in captivity including the UK\u2019s London Zoo the first institution outside of the Philippines to successfully breed the rat. The aim is to establish a viable captive population outside of the Philippines as an \u2018insurance population\u2019 (4).

It was extirpated from the Middle East in the 19<sup>th</sup> century and by 1940 the species was believed to be extinct (7) but thankfully in 1956 two tiny wild populations were discovered in the Kuzistan province of Iran (4) (7).,The Persian fallow deer has been rescued from the brink of extinction by substantial conservation efforts.

This large-scale extraction is thought to be the cause of the large declines suffered by this bird but guano harvests continue every five to seven years regardless. Hunting also continues and many birds are killed by the fishing industry as <strong>by-catch</strong>. Introduced rats cats and foxes have exterminated the Peruvian diving-petrel on many islands and continue to pose a threat to the remaining populations (2).,All breeding colonies of the Peruvian diving-petrel are found in reserves but only one of these benefits from trained guards. Searches have taken place to find further colonies in Chile but to no avail. As the threats to this species continue with no sign of abatement it is crucial to address them. Predator control and halting <strong>guano</strong> extraction are particularly important if this species is to survive (2).,,,,,,,,,,Black spider monkey, black-faced spider monkey, Chamek spider monkey, Peruvian black spider monkey,Peruvian spider monkey ,Animalia,Chordata,Mammalia,Primates,Atelidae,Ateles (1),ca. 7 kg (2),The Peruvian spider monkey is under serious threat from hunting for food as well as from habitat loss as forests are cleared for agriculture cattle ranching and mining (1). Selective logging may also remove key fruiting trees such as figs and open up the forest to further hunting (1) (14) while the building of the Transoceanic highway between Brazil and Peru brings the threat of increased hunting and deforestation throughout the southern part of the species\u2019 range (1). Its dependence on mature undisturbed forest makes the Peruvian spider monkey particularly vulnerable to habitat loss and degradation while its slow reproductive rate means that populations take a long time to recover from any losses (1) (2) (5) (8) (15).,The Peruvian spider monkey occurs in many protected areas throughout its range (1) and international trade in the species should be regulated under its listing on Appendix II of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) (3). However tighter controls on hunting together with stronger measures to preserve its habitat are likely to be needed if this charismatic primate is to be properly protected.,,,,,,,Charrancito Peruano,Peruvian tern ,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Charadriiformes,Laridae,Sterna (1),Size: 22 ‰ÛÒ 24 cm (2),The Peruvian tern\u2019s small population is largely threatened by disturbance and loss of its breeding grounds due to human development frequently the building of shanty towns and summer homes and as the result of human activities such as 4x4 vehicle driving on the beaches. Off-road vehicles have also led to increased access and therefore disturbance to previously inaccessible breeding areas. In Chile current concerns include the building of port facilities at Mejillones off-road driving at Rio Loa and the construction of coastal highways throughout the north. In Paracas Bay Peru increased pollution may also pose a risk to the birds (5). Furthermore with greater development and human encroachment on the Peruvian tern\u2019s breeding habitat comes a greater threat from domestic animals such as dogs and cats which may disturb prey or trample upon eggs and young chicks (3). This already rare bird has also undoubtedly suffered from the 1972 collapse of anchovetta stocks an important food source which have not subsequently recovered (5).,There are currently no known conservation measures underway to protect the Peruvian tern (5). Suggested measures include searching for colonies in previously unsurveyed areas and protecting known colonies from habitat disturbance and destruction such as by building fences around breeding sites to prevent vehicle access (3).,,,,,,,,,,Anthony‰Ûªs poison-arrow frog, phantasmal poison-arrow frog,Phantasmal poison frog ,Animalia,Chordata,Amphibia,Anura,Dendrobatidae,Epipedobates (1),Epipedobates (1),[],[],,,,,,,,,Procambarus pecki,Phantom cave crayfish ,Animalia,Arthropoda,Crustacea,Decapoda,Cambaridae,Cambarus (1),Cambarus (1),[],[],,,,,,,,,,Presbytis phayrei,Phayre‰Ûªs langur ,Animalia,Chordata,Mammalia,Primates,Cercopithecidae,Trachypithecus (1),Trachypithecus (1),[],[],,,,,,,,,,Stenophis variabilis,Phisalixella ,Animalia,Chordata,Reptilia,Squamata,Lamprophiidae,Phisalixella (1),Phisalixella (1),[],[],,,,,,,,,,Lacerta kulzeri,Phoenicolacerta ,Animalia,Chordata,Reptilia,Squamata,Lacertidae,Phoenicolacerta (1),Phoenicolacerta (1),[],[],,,,,,,,,,Petrel de las Phoenix,Phoenix petrel ,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Procellariiformes,Procellariidae,Pterodroma (1),Pterodroma (1),[],[],,,,,,,,,,Paraphoxinus alepidotus,Phoxinellus ,Animalia,Chordata,Actinopterygii,Cypriniformes,Cyprinidae,Phoxinellus (1),Length: up to 14.5 cm (2),Water extraction water pollution and drought are currently considered to be the greatest threats to <em>Phoxinellus alepidotus</em> and other freshwater fish in the region.

The additional pressure of hunting for both food and for the pet trade is adding to the problem (8). It is thought that up to ten animals will have died during capture or transit for every baby gibbon sold as a pet (8).,The pileated gibbon is protected from international trade by its listing on Appendix I of the Convention on International trade in endangered Species (CITES) (2). The World Association of Zoos and Aquariums (WAZA) established an International Studbook in 1990 for the pileated gibbon and conservation breeding programmes were set up to ensure there is a viable reserve population (9). The Cardomom Project was set up with Fauna &amp; Flora International (FFI) to preserve the Cardomom Mountains region in south west Cambodia to protect both the habitat from destruction and the wildlife from hunters.

Predation by introduced species such as the macaque (<i>Macaca fasicularis</i>) mongoose (<i>Herpestes auropunctatus</i>) rats and feral cats have further decimated the population (6). Cyclones also batter the island destroying nest sites (2).,The pink pigeon has been rescued from the very brink of extinction by an intensive management programme in partnership between the Durrell Wildlife Conservation Trust (8) Mauritian Wildlife Foundation and the Wildlife Preservation Trust Canada (7). A captive breeding programme began in the early 1980s (6) and Gerald Durrell released the first individuals into the wild in 1984 (9). As of 2002 there are around 350 birds in the wild (9) and the project is fast approaching its target of 500 individuals (6). To supplement the captive breeding and release programme conservation efforts such as the establishment of Conservation Management Areas habitat restoration control of predators and supplementary feeding has enabled this species to increase in abundance (2). Although intensive management of the species is still required the rescue of the pink pigeon is a fantastic success story and a great example of what concerted conservation efforts can achieve.,,,,,,,,,,Pernambuco spinetail,Pinto's spinetail ,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Furnariidae,Synallaxis (1),Synallaxis (1),[],[],,,,,,,,,,Pinus nelsoni,Pinus ,Plantae,Tracheophyta,Coniferopsida,Coniferales,Pinaceae,Pinus (1),Pinus (1),[],[],,,,,,,,,,Pino PiÌ±onero Enano, PiÌ±Ì_n Amarillo, PotosÌ_ PiÌ±on,Pinus ,Plantae,Tracheophyta,Coniferopsida,Coniferales,Pinaceae,Pinus (1),Pinus (1),[],[],,,,,,,,MaxipiÌ±on, Pino Azul, PiÌ±on Real,Pinus ,Plantae,Tracheophyta,Coniferopsida,Coniferales,Pinaceae,Pinus (1),Pinus (1),[],[],,,,,,,,Mapou de grand bois,Pisonia ,Plantae,Tracheophyta,Magnoliopsida,Caryophyllales,Nyctaginaceae,Pisonia (1),Height: up to 22 m (2),In the past large areas of forest on Silhouette were cleared with only forest in the steep and inaccessible areas of the island left untouched (2).  As a result an area covering just half a hectare harbours the remaining <i>Pisonia sechellarum</i> (1) a population which was estimated to contain just 190 trees in 1990 (2).  This small population suffers from suspected low <strong>genetic diversity</strong> and a poor rate of seed <strong>germination</strong> (1) factors which my hinder the population\u2019s recovery and threaten its survival.,The small area in which <i>Pisonia sechellarum</i> occurs lies within forest protected by the Nature Protection Trust of Seychelles (NPTS) (1).  The NPTS established the Silhouette Conservation Project in 1997 and has since been protecting the island\u2019s environments and endeavouring to restore them to a near-natural state (4).

However by 2005 the numbers of cats and rats had recovered and after two unsuccessful eradication attempts there may be little support for a third (3). Habitat degradation is also a threat due to clearance for crops and gardening browsing by goats overexploitation for wood and the spread of introduced plants such as the rose apple. Today only remnants of the original vegetation remain (3) (4). The highly restricted range of the Pitcairn reed-warbler covering just the five square kilometres of Pitcairn puts it at particular risk as does its small population which is continuing to decline due to ongoing predation and habitat loss (2) (3).,Although eradication programmes for cats and rats have previously been undertaken on Pitcairn rat eradication was unsuccessful leading the island residents to reintroduce cats in an effort to control rat numbers. However further attempts to control or eradicate these predators have been recommended (3). The Pitcairn reed-warbler is protected from killing or egg-collection under Local Government Regulations 1971 (4) and it has been suggested that the islanders be involved in monitoring its population. Protection of the remaining forest habitat as well as preventing the introduction of further alien species will also be important for the reed-warbler\u2019s survival (3).

In Indonesia habitat destruction is a major problem as a result of illegal and commercial logging and large agricultural projects such as rubber and oil palm plantations (7).  <i>Nepenthes boschiana</i> is not found in any national park or protected area (8) and has a highly localised distribution making this species particularly susceptible to extinction through habitat destruction or catastrophic environmental events such as drought or fire. In addition montane species such as <i>Nepenthes boschiana</i> take longer to recover than lowland plants after such events as growth is slower (2).,Although listed under Appendix II of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) which limits the international export of this species (3) trade is very difficult to regulate.  There is no requirement for internationally traded <i>Nepenthes</i> to be identified down to species level and plants simply labelled as <i>Nepenthes </i>accounted for 94 percent of all exported <i>Nepenthes </i>plants between 1988 and 1993.  This needs to be remedied and urgent attention is required to close other trade loopholes (2).  <i>Nepenthes</i> species including <i>Nepenthes boschiana</i> are being increasingly cultivated helping to reduce the impact on wild populations.

It is thought that breeding success is affected by the presence of several introduced species on the islands including cattle sheep pigs cats dogs rats and the weka bird (<i>Gallirallus australis</i>). Birds are sometimes illegally shot by fisherman for stealing their catch and they are also caught in very large numbers in crayfish pots. Changes in the marine environment associated with climate change may be affecting the prey species of the Pitt Island shag (2).,The sheep and cattle of Rangatira were removed in 1961 as were the sheep of Mangere Island in 1968. This was judged to have had a beneficial effect and authorities are now working to remove feral cats and weka from Pitt Island and sheep cattle and pigs from parts of Pitt and Chatham Island that are deemed to be suitable for nesting <strong>colonies</strong>. <strong>Colonies</strong> that appear to be suffering as a result of stock may be fenced off in the future depending on agreements with local people and landowners (2).,,,,,,,,,,Habenaria longibracteata, Habenaria micrantha,Platanthera ,Plantae,Tracheophyta,Liliopsida,Orchidales,Orchidaceae,Platanthera (1),Platanthera (1),[],[],,,,,,,,,Platy Cuatro Cienegas,Platy cuatro cienegas ,Animalia,Chordata,Actinopterygii,Cyprinodontiformes,Poeciliidae,Xiphophorus (1),Xiphophorus (1),[],[],,,,,,,,,,CristÌ_bal, ÌÔambar,Platymiscium ,Plantae,Tracheophyta,Magnoliopsida,Fabales,Leguminosae,Platymiscium (1),Platymiscium (1),[],[],,,,,,,,,Festuca subverticillata, Poa laxa,Poa ,Plantae,Tracheophyta,Liliopsida,Cyperales,Gramineae,Poa (1),Poa (1),[],[],,,,,,,,,Podarcis erhardii cretensis,Podarcis ,Animalia,Chordata,Reptilia,Squamata,Lacertidae,Podarcis (1),Podarcis (1),[],[],,,,,,,,,,Ranitomeya tolimense,Poison frog ,Animalia,Chordata,Amphibia,Anura,Dendrobatidae,Ranitomeya (1),Ranitomeya (1),[],[],,,,,,,,,,Polillo wrinkled ground frog,Polillo forest frog ,Animalia,Chordata,Amphibia,Anura,Ranidae,Platymantis (1),Platymantis (1),[],[],,,,,,,,,,Malau, Niuafo‰Ûªou megapode, Niuafo‰Ûªou scrubfowl, Polynesian scrubfowl,Polynesian megapode ,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Galliformes,Megapodiidae,Megapodius (1),Size: 28 cm (2),The Polynesian megapode occupies a precarious existence being restricted to just two tiny islands with the Niuafo'ou population declining due to over-harvesting and predation. All nesting sites on Niuafo'ou are harvested by the local human population with at least 50 % of all eggs being collected or destroyed. Adults are also hunted on a smaller scale and both adults and chicks suffer from predation by feral cats and dogs. Pigs may pose an additional threat by competing for food. Fortunately Fonualei is uninhabited and little-visited so the population there is relatively safe from the threats of hunting and human disturbance (5). In 2003 an incredible 300 to 500 birds were estimated to exist on the island a significant increase from the 35 eggs and chicks that were introduced in 1993. Following this remarkable discovery which effectively doubled the total known population of Polynesian megapode the species was downlisted from Critically Endangered to Endangered on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species (5) (3).,The Polynesian megapode is legally protected although in practice there is no real enforcement and egg-collecting urgently needs to be brought under control. From 1991 to 1993 60 eggs were introduced on Late Island buried at volcanically heated sites and 35 eggs and chicks were transferred to Fonualei both islands being uninhabited rarely visited and with appropriate egg-laying conditions. While surveys suggest the reintroduction on Late failed the now established population on Fonualei is a fantastic conservation success story and provides new hope for the future of this rare bird. It has been advocated that Fonualei should be given Reserve status and if achieved this volcanic island may prove to be the safe refuge that ensures the Polynesian megapodes long-term survival (5). However there is always the threat of eruption which could potentially destroy the Fonualei population completely and thus this species\u2019 restricted range leaves it in an extremely vulnerable position.,,,,,,,Polynesian storm petrel, white-throated storm petrel, white-throated storm-petrel,Polynesian storm-petrel ,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Procellariiformes,Hydrobatidae,Nesofregetta (1),Nesofregetta (1),[],[],,,,,,,,Preuss‰Ûªs monkey,Preuss‰Ûªs guenon ,Animalia,Chordata,Mammalia,Primates,Cercopithecidae,Cercopithecus (1),Average body length: 47.7 cm (2),Over the past 27 years populations of Preuss\u2019s guenon have decreased by an incredible 50 percent (1) due to a combination of habitat loss and hunting. As a result of farming fire and the collection of wood for fuel little of Cameroon\u2019s <strong>montane forest</strong> remains. Preuss\u2019s guenon is particularly vulnerable to hunting due to its fairly large size and its semi-terrestrial habits; spending time on land increases its risk of being killed. Hunting of this species is a particular problem on the island of Bioko (1).,A significant hindrance to the conservation of this species is that no <strong>montane forest</strong> in the Cameroon highlands is currently protected; this situation needs to urgently change as it is the most critical remaining habitat for Preuss\u2019s guenon. However there are several national parks elsewhere in this monkeys\u2019 range including Banyang Hbo Forest in Cameroon Cross River National Park in Nigeria and Pico Basil National Park on Bioko Island (1).

Vast areas of the native rainforest have been cleared for timber and for the construction of oil-palm plantations which now constitute one of Malaysia's top exports (4). Proboscis monkeys do not adapt to degraded habitat and recent technical advances have meant that even mangrove swamps may now be logged (4). Hunting is also a threat to the survival of this species; their propensity to gather in large groups on the river's edge makes these monkeys easy targets (4).,The proboscis monkey is protected by law (4) and is listed on Appendix I of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) banning international trade (3). This species is found in at least a dozen protected areas (2). Recently a vital area of wetland in Sabah has been designated as a sanctuary for a wide range of endangered species such as Asian elephants (<i>Elephas maximus</i>) and orang-utans (<i>Pongo pygmaeus</i>) as well as proboscis monkeys; this area is the Kinabatangan Wildlife Sanctuary (4). However even this corridor is currently fragmented by plantations which proboscis monkeys cannot cross (4). The protection of remaining tracts of contiguous habitat is therefore vital for the survival of this unusual looking monkey.,,,,,,,,,,Prosperine rock wallaby,Proserpine rock wallaby ,Animalia,Chordata,Mammalia,Diprotodontia,Macropodidae,Petrogale (1),Petrogale (1),[],[],,,,,,,,,,Takh, Takhi,Przewalski's horse ,Animalia,Chordata,Mammalia,Perissodactyla,Equidae,Equus (1),350 kg (2),Habitat degradation human activities including hunting and conflict along with competition with domestic livestock for water and forage were all thought to be responsible for driving the extinction of Przewalski's horse in the wild in the 1960s (4). Thankfully it has been possible to reintroduce this unique survivor into the wild. However those reintroduced populations still face threats; primarily that of <strong>hybridisation</strong> with domestic horses along with competition with domestic horses for resources (1).,After the <strong>subspecies</strong> became Extinct in the Wild it clung on in a number of small populations in various zoos around the world. In 1977 the Foundation for the Preservation and Protection of the Przewalski's horse (FPPPH) was established in the Netherlands with the long-term aim of returning this ancient horse to the wild (6). At that time there were around 300 horses in zoos and parks and their breeding was managed in order to prevent <strong>inbreeding</strong> (6). In the 1990s The Mongolian Association for Conservation of Nature and the Environment (MACNE) and the FPPPH collaborated to reintroduce a number of individuals in small herds into the Hustai National Park in central Mongolia (7). The national symbol was a welcome return to the area and part of an important drive to save the steppe biotope (6). Today more than 120 Przewalski's horses live in Hustai and a further conservation programme run by the International Takhi Group (a consortium of European takhi breeding institutions) together with the Mongolian Commission for Endangered Species has introduced a further 50 horses to an area in the Dzungarian Gobi in Southwest Mongolia (5). The return of the Przewalski's horse to its natural environment is a success story for conservation and despite ongoing problems it is hoped that at least two large self-sustained populations will soon be a reality (7).,,,,,,,,,Philautus sarasinorum,Pseudophilautus ,Animalia,Chordata,Amphibia,Anura,Rhacophoridae,Pseudophilautus (1),Pseudophilautus (1),[],[],,,,,,,,,,Philautus auratus,Pseudophilautus ,Animalia,Chordata,Amphibia,Anura,Rhacophoridae,Pseudophilautus (1),Pseudophilautus (1),[],[],,,,,,,,,,Philautus hoffmanni,Pseudophilautus ,Animalia,Chordata,Amphibia,Anura,Rhacophoridae,Pseudophilautus (1),Pseudophilautus (1),[],[],,,,,,,,,,Philautus mooreorum,Pseudophilautus ,Animalia,Chordata,Amphibia,Anura,Rhacophoridae,Pseudophilautus (1),Pseudophilautus (1),[],[],,,,,,,,,,Philautus poppiae,Pseudophilautus ,Animalia,Chordata,Amphibia,Anura,Rhacophoridae,Pseudophilautus (1),Pseudophilautus (1),[],[],,,,,,,,,,Grumilea gardneri, Psychotria gardneri var. jayasuriyae, Uragoga gardneri,Psychotria ,Plantae,Tracheophyta,Magnoliopsida,Rubiales,Rubiaceae,Psychotria (1),Psychotria (1),[],[],,,,,,,,Puerto Rican whip-poor-will,Puerto Rican nightjar ,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Caprimulgiformes,Caprimulgidae,Caprimulgus (1),Caprimulgus (1),[],[],,,,,,,,,,Upland coqui,Puerto Rican robber frog ,Animalia,Chordata,Amphibia,Anura,Leptodactylidae,Eleutherodactylus (1),Eleutherodactylus (1),[],[],,,,,,,,,,Philautus silus,Pug-nosed shrub frog ,Animalia,Chordata,Amphibia,Anura,Rhacophoridae,Pseudophilautus (1),Pseudophilautus (1),[],[],,,,,,,,,,Fauvette nasique de Pulitzer,Pulitzer's longbill ,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Sylviidae,Macrosphenus (1),Macrosphenus (1),[],[],,,,,,,,,,Systomus arulius, Systomus rubrotinctus,Puntius ,Animalia,Chordata,Actinopterygii,Cypriniformes,Cyprinidae,Puntius (1),Puntius (1),[],[],,,,,,,,,Puntius arulius tambraparniei,Puntius ,Animalia,Chordata,Actinopterygii,Cypriniformes,Cyprinidae,Puntius (1),Puntius (1),[],[],,,,,,,,,,pig-nosed frog,Purple frog ,Animalia,Chordata,Amphibia,Anura,Nasikabatrachidae,Nasikabatrachus (1),Snout-vent length: 5.3 ‰ÛÒ 9 cm (2),Known from only 135 individuals of which only three are female the purple frog is thought to be an extremely rare species. The main threat to this elusive frog is the loss of its forest habitat to encroaching agriculture (1). Within the Western Ghats over 90 percent of the forest has been lost with conversion to coffee cardamom ginger and other crop plantations the most significant agents (1) (2). The potential for dam developments to inundate vast areas of its habitat also mean that the status of the purple frog is extremely precarious (7).,Due to its threatened status and evolutionary distinctiveness the purple frog is categorised as a focal species on the Zoological Society of London\u2019s EDGE of Existence programme. This project aims to highlight the need for the conservation of this unique species while establishing a set of conservation priorities and as a result studies are currently being undertaken to investigate the purple frog\u2019s ecology and threats (5).\xa0,,,,,,,,,,ColibrÌ_ de Alicia,Purple-backed sunbeam ,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Apodiformes,Trochilidae,Aglaeactis (1),7.3 ‰ÛÒ 8.3 g (2),Restricted to a very small area that is heavily populated the greatest threat to the purple-backed sunbeam is the conversion of <i>Alnus</i> dominated shrubland to <i>Eucalyptus</i> plantations as this removes the <strong>parasitic</strong> mistletoe upon which it feeds (4).\xa0The species\u2019 restricted range also makes it vulnerable to the effects of chance natural events such as disease and drought while the low population number estimated at less than 1000 birds may mean that it has a very low genetic diversity. Historically the Maranon River landscape has undergone high levels of habitat conversion for cultivation and much of the original natural habitat has been lost or continues to be degraded.\xa0Cattle ranching logging and firewood collecting has removed much of the forest habitat while oil extraction is a potential future problem (4) (7).,The Maranon valley home to the purple-backed sunbeam is an area of high conservation importance as its isolation and unique habitats has resulted in a large degree of <strong>endemism</strong>.\xa0A total of twenty two bird species are <strong>endemic</strong> to the valley and as a result it has been designated as a Birdlife International Endemic Bird Area (EBA) (7).\xa0The Maranon valley has also been designated as part of the Maranon-Alto Mayo Conservation corridor as it supports a high number of conservation priority areas. \xa0The American Bird Conservancy has been working to analyse the distribution of rare bird species within the Maranon valley and identify the areas and habitats that require protection.\xa0A wide array of conservation strategies have been proposed including strict protected area status sustainable conservation and community owned nature reserves. However at present only 0.1 percent of the Maranon valley has any legal protection and these measures need to be applied urgently (8).\xa0,,,,,,,,,,purple-faced leaf monkey,Purple-faced langur ,Animalia,Chordata,Mammalia,Primates,Cercopithecidae,Trachypithecus (1),Male head-body length: 50 ‰ÛÒ 65 cm (2)Female head-body length: 45 ‰ÛÒ 60 cm (2)Male tail length: 67 ‰ÛÒ 85 cm(2)Female tail length: 62 ‰ÛÒ 82 cm (2)Male weight: 3.4 ‰ÛÒ 9.4 kg (2)Female weight: 3.1 ‰ÛÒ 9 kg (2),The purple-faced langur\u2019s range has contracted greatly in the face of human encroachment. Deforestation as a result of agricultural industrial and residential development has led to habitat loss and fragmentation and the consequent isolation of subpopulations which impedes out-breeding and genetic diversity. From 1956 to 1993 Sri Lanka lost more than 50 percent of its forests to human activities followed by a similar rate of decline between 1994 and 2003. This species has also suffered from hunting and illegal trade of its meat and skin with the skin used to make drums in some areas. The purple-faced langur is hunted mainly for subsistence living and trade at local village level. According to continuing trends populations of this species are predicted to decline by more than 50 percent within the next 11 to 22 years (1).,The commercial exploitation of purple-faced langurs is regulated by their listing on Appendix II of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) (3). All four <strong>subspecies</strong> are also protected under the Flora and Fauna Protection Ordinance 1993 and exist in a number of protected areas (1). However the issue of habitat loss still places these <strong>subspecies</strong> classified as Endangered and Critically Endangered at serious risk of extinction (1). Indeed the Critically Endangered western purple-faced langur (<i>T. v. nestor</i>) was officially recognised in 2004 as one of the world\u2019s 25 most endangered primates. This <strong>subspecies</strong> requires good canopy cover but possibly fewer than three forests currently exist within Sri Lanka that can support viable populations and none of these are within protected areas. Furthermore the human-modified areas that support much of the langur population such as gardens and rubber plantations are under private ownership and therefore unstable changing rapidly due to human population expansion and development. Censuses are therefore urgently needed to identify forest areas suitable for conservation. Further studies are also essential to better understand the decline of sub-populations in both space and time in the extremely disturbed habitats where these langurs survive today (6).,,,,,,,,,,Purple-capped lory,Purple-naped lory ,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Psittaciformes,Psittacidae,Lorius (1),Lorius (1),[],[],,,,,,,,,,golden mahaseer,Putitor mahseer ,Animalia,Chordata,Actinopterygii,Cypriniformes,Cyprinidae,Tor (1),Tor (1),[],[],,,,,,,,,,Centrolenella puyoensis, Cochranella puyoensis,Puyo giant glass frog ,Animalia,Chordata,Amphibia,Anura,Centrolenidae,Nymphargus (1),Nymphargus (1),[],[],,,,,,,,,Pygmy hippo,Pygmy hippopotamus ,Animalia,Chordata,Mammalia,Cetartiodactyla,Hippopotamidae,Choeropsis (1),180 - 275 kg (2),Deforestation is the main threat facing the pygmy hippopotamus (2). Hunting is also known to occur but the extent of this has not been determined (2). The <strong>subspecies</strong> <i>C. l. heslopi</i> in Nigeria may already be extinct (2).,Direct conservation action is required to prevent precipitous declines and potential extinction (7). At present there is a good captive population which has bred successfully in captivity and has doubled in size over the last 25 years (2). If the wild population becomes extinct it should be possible to maintain the species in captivity providing a last-ditch safeguard against total extinction (2).,,,,,,,,,,Pyrenees frog,Pyrenean frog ,Animalia,Chordata,Amphibia,Anura,Ranidae,Rana (1),Male length: up to 46 mm (2) (3)Female length: up to 51 mm (2) (3),One of the key threats to the Pyrenean frog is the <strong>eutrophication</strong> of streams as a result of the intensification of agricultural practices (1) (8) which leads to increased levels of pesticides fertilisers and other pollutants in local watercourses (2).\xa0\xa0,The Pyrenean frog is listed on Appendix III of the Bern Convention which means that it should be protected (9). This species is found in several protected areas including the Ordesa and Monte Perdido National Park (1) (3) (8) and Lizardoia Integral Reserve (1) (8).,,,,,,,,,,OrnithoptÌÄå¬re De La Reine Alexandra,Queen AlexandraÌ¢åÛåªs birdwing ,Animalia,Arthropoda,Insecta,Lepidoptera,Papilionidae,Ornithoptera (1),Wingspan: 19 Ì¢åÛåÒ 28 cm (2),As one of the world\xe2\x80\x99s most beautiful butterflies Queen Alexandra\xe2\x80\x99s birdwing is extremely attractive to collectors. Fetching thousands of dollars per butterfly this rare species has suffered severely from over harvesting (4). Recognising a dramatic decline in 1966 the Papua New Guinea government gave Queen Alexandra\xe2\x80\x99s birdwing legal protection from collectors. Consequently trade in this butterfly has been somewhat reduced but illegal collection continues to threaten this species. Today however the greatest threat to Queen Alexandra\xe2\x80\x99s birdwing is the loss of its lowland rainforest habitat. Historically forests were cleared for subsistence farming and logging and large tracts of forest were destroyed by the volcanic eruption of Mount Lamington in 1951. Presently the main cause behind forest loss is the expansion of the palm oil industry compounded by the development of rubber and cocoa plantations (7).\xa0\xa0,Threatened by illegal trade and habitat loss the survival of Queen Alexandra\xe2\x80\x99s birdwing is dependant upon the successful implementation of conservation measures. To abate trade pressure Queen Alexandra\xe2\x80\x99s birdwing is listed on Appendix I of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) and as an Annex A species in the EU Council Regulation on trade of wild species both of which prohibit international trade (2) (3). Furthermore the Papua New Guinea government has provided financial aid to local communities to develop butterfly nurseries.\xa0 These licensed farms aim to sustainably trade wild butterflies whilst providing local communities with an additional income and improving the long-term survival prospects of many rare butterfly species (8). In addition a large wildlife management area has been created protecting much Queen Alexandra\xe2\x80\x99s birdwing habitat. Assuming these measures continue successfully there is significant hope that the beautiful Queen Alexandra\xe2\x80\x99s birdwing will continue to grace the forests of Papua New Guinea (7).\xa0,,,,,,,,,,Queen of the Puna,Queen of the Andes ,Plantae,Tracheophyta,Liliopsida,Poales,Bromeliaceae,Puya (1),Puya (1),The high Peruvian Andes have suffered thousands of years of heavy human impact through vegetation destruction grazing by livestock fires and the introduction of exotic species (5). Today the Queen of the Andes has an extremely fragmented distribution with many populations comprising just a few hundred individuals or even less. Cattle are often allowed to roam freely in this species\u2019 habitat which results in the trampling or consumption of young plants hindering reproduction. Fires are often used to create farmland as well as to gain access to the starch in this plant\u2019s trunk to feed cattle indiscriminately destroying all vegetation in the area (1) (4).\xa0,Due to its high proportion or rare and <strong>endemic</strong> plant species the Andean region is regarded as being a \u201chyperhot\u201d priority for plant conservation meaning action is urgently required to preserve this unique ecosystem and its important vegetation. Any conservation action in the Andes cannot fail to consider the need to conserve the Queen of the Andes perhaps the most conspicuous and charismatic member of the Andean floral community (5).\xa0,,,,,,,,,,Rana De Garganta Manchada,Rainfrog ,Animalia,Chordata,Amphibia,Anura,Leptodactylidae,Eleutherodactylus (1),Eleutherodactylus (1),[],[],,,,,,,,,,Rana ArborÌ_cula De Bromelia,Rana arboricula de bromelia ,Animalia,Chordata,Amphibia,Anura,Hylidae,Bromeliohyla (1),Bromeliohyla (1),[],[],,,,,,,,,,Eupsophus ginesi,Rangel robber frog ,Animalia,Chordata,Amphibia,Anura,Leptodactylidae,Eleutherodactylus (1),Eleutherodactylus (1),[],[],,,,,,,,,,Hogsback frog,Rattray's frog ,Animalia,Chordata,Amphibia,Anura,Pyxicephalidae,Anhydrophryne (1),Anhydrophryne (1),[],[],,,,,,,,,,Clytoctantes alixi,Recurve-billed bushbird ,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Thamnophilidae,Clytoctantes (1),Clytoctantes (1),[],[],,,,,,,,,,Mountain frog, red tunnel frog,Red and yellow mountain frog ,Animalia,Chordata,Amphibia,Anura,Limnodynastidae,Philoria (1),Philoria (1),[],[],,,,,,,,,Latanier de la RÌ©union, Latanier rouge,Red latan palm ,Plantae,Tracheophyta,Liliopsida,Arecales,Palmae,Latania (1),Height: up to 15 m (2),This once common palm has declined in extent and abundance due to increasing agriculture and the expansion of human settlements (1).,There are no known conservation measures in place for the red latan palm but this species is cultivated as an ornamental palm around the world (2) (4).,,,,,,,,,common sea bream, Couch‰Ûªs sea bream,Red porgy ,Animalia,Chordata,Actinopterygii,Perciformes,Sparidae,Pagrus (1),Length: up to 85 cm (2),This Endangered species is of great interest to commercial fisheries in certain parts of its distribution (4).  For example it is one of the most important fishes taken by the Moroccan fishing fleet (4) and the second most important species for coastal bottom fisheries in the Azores (5).  There is some evidence that this exploitation is having a negative effect on red porgy populations; for example in southern Brazil trawl fishing during the 1970s left red porgy stocks over-exploited (10).,In some areas of its range fishery regulations exist for the red porgy.  For instance off the southern coast of the United States there is a size limit in place a ban on the sale or purchase of red porgy between January and April (an important spawning period) and limits to how many can be caught during a fishing trip (11).,,,,,,,,,Red-ruffed lemur,Red ruffed lemur ,Animalia,Chordata,Mammalia,Primates,Lemuridae,Varecia (1),Varecia (1),[],[],,,,,,,,,,Almug, Saunderswood,Red sandalwood ,Plantae,Tracheophyta,Magnoliopsida,Fabales,Leguminosae,Pterocarpus (1),Pterocarpus (1),[],[],,,,,,,,,Cardenalito, LÌ_gano Cardenalito, LÌ_gano Encapuchado,Red siskin ,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Fringillidae,Carduelis (1),Length: 10 cm (2),The red siskin is under threat from illegal trapping for the cage bird industry which has caused a rapid decline in numbers of this species over the last 150 years. Unfortunately this bird is highly popular among breeders because of the fact that it can be successfully bred with canaries to produce a popular colourful <strong>hybrid</strong> (2).,"Trapping of the red siskin in the wild has been illegal in Venezuela since the 1940s and this species is also protected by law in Guyana (2) (4)<warehouse:ref entitytype=""ScientificReference""></warehouse:ref>.

The attractive plumage of the red-and-blue lory has made it a popular cage bird for over a century and consequently wild birds have been intensively trapped to fulfil the demand for international trade. Trapping began as early as the 19<sup>th</sup>century with most birds being traded within Indonesia and the Philippines. Trapping intensified in the 1990s with an estimated 1000 to 2000 birds leaving Karakelang each year (6). Around 3500 birds were traded between 1992 and 1993 which attracted more trappers and resulted in the development of modern more efficient trapping methods. In 1995 the red-and-blue lory was at last listed under Appendix I of CITES which prohibited international trade excluding exceptional circumstances such as scientific research (3). However trapping continued in the latter 1990s with an estimated 80 percent of the illegal trade going to the Philippines (7).\xa0\xa0,Karakelang is believed to contain the only remaining viable population of the red-and-blue lory and consequently efforts are underway to reduce trade on the island (7) (10). The Action Sampiri project is working to improve awareness amongst local communities about the global importance of the island to the species and to improve future land use. Investigations by the wildlife trade monitoring network TRAFFIC and the inclusion of the species on the Indonesian list of protected species also highlights the species\u2019 plight and the urgent need for the application of conservation measures (7). A substantial part of the red-and-blue lory\u2019s range is within the Karakelang Wildlife Sanctuary although there is believed to be no management plan for this protected area and the level of law enforcement varies. The red-and-blue lory will also benefit from numerous proposed conservation measures including the monitoring of population trends and trapping levels the strict enforcement of trade legislation provision of training and resources to park management staff and the continuation of community awareness programmes (6).,,,,,,,,,Blumenbach‰Ûªs curassow, mutum,Red-billed curassow ,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Galliformes,Cracidae,Crax (1),c. 3.5 kg (2),The red-billed curassow has suffered from habitat loss and hunting and is now thought to be on the brink of extinction with fewer than 250 individuals estimated to remain in small fragmented subpopulations. Virtually all lowland forest north of Rio de Janeiro has disappeared outside of reserves having been converted to plantations and pastureland. Even in Monte Pascoal National Park habitat loss continues as a result of conflicts over the land rights of local people. Hunting and capture for the bird trade persist in some reserves and are likely to have a severe impact on such small fragmented populations (4).,This rare bird is protected under Brazilian law and listed on Appendix I of CITES making international trade in the species illegal. Of the few reserves where this species can still be found Sooretama and Linhares are the most effectively protected and contain strongholds of over 60 and 100 individuals respectively (4). A captive-breeding and reintroduction programme in a number of protected sites in 1990 and 1991 has been highly successful helping to boost numbers in the wild but the total population nevertheless remains extremely small (2) (4). If this large and distinctive forest bird is to survive it is imperative that all reserves with known populations are vigilantly patrolled and protected to prevent the hunting and trapping that continue to threaten its existence (4).,,,,,,,,,Barnacla Cuellirroja,Red-breasted goose ,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Anseriformes,Anatidae,Branta (1),Length: 53 ‰ÛÒ 56 cm (2),Hunting in Bulgaria as well as in Romania and Ukraine is a threat for the red-breasted goose. Tourist trips for hunting are becoming more common in Ukraine and birds are often shot at the breeding grounds in Russia. Additionally climate change is expected to alter tundra habitats and thereby reduce breeding success. The use of rodenticides in the wintering grounds has also had a deleterious impact upon populations of the red-breasted goose (2) (8).,The red-breasted goose is legally protected in many key states and parts of the breeding and wintering ranges are protected but hunting continues regardless. Wintering sites in Bulgaria Romania and Ukraine are on a monitoring programme through the Red-breasted Goose Monitoring and Research Programme. The goal is to provide up-to-date information regarding the status of the species its habitat movements ecology and conservation needs (10). In Bulgaria a management plan is being implemented for roosting lakes (2). In Romania a management plan was drafted for Lake Techirghiol in 2008 along with the Romanian National Action Plan (10). An International Action Plan was published in 1996 which proposed a number of conservation measures for the red-breasted goose. These included the expansion of monitoring and research programmes protection of key sites control of illegal hunting promotion of beneficial agricultural policies and the continuation of public awareness initiatives (8).,,,,,,,,,,red-browed parrot, Red-crowned Amazon, red-crowned parrot, red-fronted Amazon, red-fronted parrot, red-topped Amazon, red-topped parrot,Red-browed Amazon ,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Psittaciformes,Psittacidae,Amazona (1),450 - 650 g (2),Like many other <strong>endemic</strong> birds of south-eastern Brazil\u2019s Atlantic forest the red-browed Amazon has become locally extinct across most of its former range due to extensive deforestation and human encroachment during the last century. Habitat destruction has been rife and is primarily the result of conversion to plantations and pastureland and logging operations (2) (5). Surviving populations are small and fragmented and now suffer from reduced foraging sites increased competition for nesting areas and the effects of genetic isolation (2). Yet deforestation continues compounded by the ever-present threat of capture for the domestic pet trade driving this rare parrot into a steep decline (2) (6). Sadly the species is not even safe in reserves with most of the 174 nestlings poached for the national and international cage-bird trade in the 1998 to 1999 breeding season reportedly coming from \u2018protected areas\u2019. Souvenirs containing feathers have also been seen for sale outside Monte Pascoal National Park (5).,The red-browed Amazon is protected under Brazilian law and occurs in 14 reserves though most of these provide very little habitat protection on the ground and none are effective against poaching (5). Captive breeding though difficult has been successful in America and Europe and a global management plan for captive red-browed Amazons is now underway (2) (6). Reintroductions into the wild from captive stock may become an important conservation strategy in the future but it is unlikely to successfully bolster numbers until sufficient habitat is secured that can sustain expanded wild flocks (2). Thus law enforcement and <i>in situ</i> conservation to protect the diminishing Atlantic forests of Brazil must remain priorities in the protection of this and other <strong>endemic</strong> species if they are going to have any kind of future in the wild.,,,,red-cheeked macaw,Red-fronted macaw ,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Psittaciformes,Psittacidae,Ara (1),Length: 55 - 60 cm (2),The reasons for the drastic decline of this species include widespread habitat loss and degradation largely as a result of conversion to agriculture but also caused by logging and collection of firewood. This species is illegally trapped for the pet trade but the scale of this problem is unclear. Furthermore as the natural food sources of this bird are lost it has to rely more on crops and it becomes increasingly exposed to persecution as a result (2).,The red-fronted macaw is listed under Appendix I and II of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) and so international trade in this species is tightly controlled (3). Within Bolivia the capture transport and export of this species are illegal. This macaw occurs in just one protected area but just eight birds are known to breed within this park. Birdlife Bolivia initiated a conservation programme for this species in 2002 which incorporates surveying and monitoring of the species identifying priority areas of habitat for the species and establishing a community awareness programme in the area. Other proposed measures include the complete elimination of trade in this bird and fencing-off areas of suitable habitat to reduce grazing by livestock allowing the natural vegetation to make a come-back (2).,,,,,,,,,,Chinemys nigricans, Emys nigricans,Red-necked pond turtle ,Animalia,Chordata,Reptilia,Testudines,Geoemydidae,Chinemys (1),Chinemys (1),[],[],,,,,,,,,douc, red-shanked douc langur,Red-shanked douc ,Animalia,Chordata,Mammalia,Primates,Cercopithecidae,Pygathrix (1),Male tail length: 60 - 74 cm (2)Male head-body length: 55 - 60 cm (2)Female head-body length: c. 60 cm (2)Female tail length: c. 60 cm (2)Male weight: 10.9 - 12.6 kg (2)Female weight: 8.2 - 8.9 kg (2),The red-shanked douc suffers from intense levels of hunting for food and for use in traditional \u2018medicines\u2019 as well as capture for the live pet trade (1) (5) (7). Although laws exist to protect this species from hunting throughout its range such protective legislation is rarely enforced (1). This rare primate is particularly vulnerable to this exploitation as when disturbed it remains motionless in the canopy instead of fleeing making it an easy hunting target (1) (5). It has also suffered from extensive habitat loss particularly in the Central Highlands of Vietnam where large tracts of forest were damaged during wartimes (1) (8). More recently a rapidly expanding human population in this region has resulted in agricultural expansion with forest areas converted to farmlands and increased logging for coffee rubber and cashew plantations (1) (5).,The red-shanked douc is afforded the highest level of protection in Vietnam under the Wildlife Protection Law and should be protected from international trade by its listing on Appendix I of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) (3) (8). It also receives a degree of protection in a number of national parks and reserves including several in the Nam Theum basin in Lao PDR which is thought to support the largest remaining population of the species although hunting is still prevalent in many protected areas (7). There is also an ongoing captive-breeding programme for the red-shanked douc at the Endangered Primate Rescue Center at Cuc Phuong National Park in Vietnam (9). In addition the Douc Langur Foundation has been undertaking comprehensive surveys of this species in an effort to understand the distribution of populations which is vital for any successful conservation programme. The Foundation\u2019s studies are also helping to uncover greater knowledge of this still poorly understood primate such as group size and composition and social interactions (10). WWF\u2019s Indochina Programme is also carrying out vital research into the effectiveness of national parks within Vietnam and trains reserve rangers in primate survey techniques (11).

It has been recommended that the reddish parachute spider be included under Appendix II of CITES which would mean that international trade in this species should be carefully controlled.

Then in 1968 one of the most severe cyclones to ever have hit Rodrigues struck and with a search in 1969 failing to find any warblers it was thought to have wiped out one of the island\u2019s <strong>endemic</strong> birds (5).  Thankfully the species had not gone extinct and numbers have since recovered slightly primarily due to an increase in forest cover through habitat protection and <strong>afforestation</strong> (5).,The slow recovery of the Rodrigues warbler since 1969 has been the result of efforts to protect the island\u2019s watersheds which allowed the surrounding forests to mature and recover and a switch to the use of bottled gas for cooking lessening the demand for firewood (5) (6).  Nature has also played a role in this species\u2019 recovery with a recent absence of catastrophic cyclones allowing populations to increase (6).  While much of the reforestation has involved exotic trees native species are being replanted in some areas including two Conservation Management Areas where grazing animals and woodcutters are kept out and exotic plants are removed (6).  Exotic plant species are a major cause of the lack of native habitat on the island but these introduced trees and shrubs also provide a vital haven for the Rodrigues warbler in the absence of native forest.  For the native forest to regenerate it is considered necessary to remove all exotic tree species but this may have a short-term detrimental impact on warbler populations.  Hopefully the long-term benefit to the island and to the Rodrigues warbler will outweigh this short-term loss (5).  To mitigate the potential catastrophic effects of another introduced predator catastrophic cyclone or drought the possibility of introducing the warblers to a small predator-free island has also been considered and feasibility studies have been undertaken (5).,,,,,,,,,,Chirixalus romeri, Philautus romeri,Romer's treefrog ,Animalia,Chordata,Amphibia,Anura,Rhacophoridae,Liuixalus (1),Length: 1.5 - 2.5 cm (2),Romer\u2019s treefrog is primarily threatened by human disturbance and habitat destruction (1) (2) (5) while habitat degradation due to pollution is also a major threat to this species (5). The eggs and tadpoles of Romer\u2019s treefrog are vulnerable to predation by the introduced mosquitofish (<em>Gambusia affinis</em>) as well as to predation by other frogs (2) (5).,Romer\u2019s treefrog is one of three amphibian species listed under the Hong Kong Wild Animals Protection Ordinance which prohibits the hunting wilful disturbance possession sale or export of this species (2) (3) (4). A major population stronghold for Romer\u2019s treefrog Ngong Ping in Lantau has been designated a Site of Special Scientific Interest (1) (2).

The successful eradication of rabbits and goats and the very slow reforestation on Round Island led to a steady increase in numbers over the last decades (2).,A captive breeding programme has taken place at the Durrell Wildlife Conservation Trust (formerly Jersey Wildlife Preservation Trust) but is no longer run (5). The population on Round Island is monitored on a regular basis (2).,,,,,,,,,Boa De L'Ile Ronde De Dussumier,Round Island keel-scaled boa ,Animalia,Chordata,Reptilia,Squamata,Bolyeridae,Casarea (1),Length: 1 - 1.5m (2),Habitat loss has been rife throughout the Mascarene Islands. Vast tracts of native forest (over 90%) have been cleared to make way for agriculture and on Round Island the introduction of rabbits and goats has further damaged native flora (7); however these were removed during the 1980\u2019s. Perhaps 500 adults remain (with a total population of approximately 1000 individuals) on the 159-hectare Round Island (1). ,Round Island is a protected area and visitors to the island are restricted to scientists and conservationists (5). Rabbits and goats have been eradicated and the native vegetation of the island much of which is itself <strong>endemic</strong> and endangered is beginning to recover. The Government of Mauritius and the Mauritian Wildlife Foundation are also running an intensive habitat restoration programme (1). International trade is prohibited by the listing of this snake on Appendix I of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (4). A captive breeding programme has been established with the aim of safeguarding the future of this rare snake and learning more about its complex biology (2). The Round Island keel-scaled boa is one of two snakes to be found only on this island belonging to an ancient line that dates back over 60 million years (7). Its relative <i>Bolyeria multocarinata</i> however has not been seen in the wild since 1975 and is feared to be extinct (2).,,,,,,,,,,ColibrÌ_ Real,Royal sunangel ,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Apodiformes,Trochilidae,Heliangelus (1),3.5 ‰ÛÒ 4.5 g (2),The restricted range of the royal sunangel and its rather unusual habitat make this species particularly sensitive to any habitat loss or degradation occurring in the region. The habitat which it occupies is surrounded by cultivation and deforestation is increasing with much forest being cleared for marijuana and coffee plantations (2) (8).,The royal sunangel is listed on Appendix II of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) meaning that any trade in this species should be carefully controlled. There are no other specific conservation measures in place for the royal sunangel but it has been recommended that surveys are undertaken to locate any undiscovered populations and reserves should be set up to protect critical areas of its habitat (6).,,,,,,,,,,RÌ_ppell‰Ûªs griffon, RÌ_ppell‰Ûªs vulture,Rueppell‰Ûªs griffon ,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Falconiformes,Accipitridae,Gyps (1),6800 ‰ÛÒ 9000 g (2),This formerly abundant bird of prey has undergone rapid declines in much of its range particularly in West Africa and it is now largely confined to protected areas (7). Although less studied than other griffons these declines are known to have been caused by agriculture encroaching on their habitat large-scale incidental poisoning and persecution (2) (6). In West Africa Rueppell\u2019s griffon has been heavily exploited for use in Black Magic (7).,Rueppell\u2019s griffon occurs in a number of protected areas throughout its range including Serengeti National Park Tanzania; a World Heritage Site and an important feeding area for the griffon (8). The continued protection of these areas is important for preventing greater declines of Rueppell\u2019s griffon as is establishing legal protection particularly in West Africa in an effort to reduce levels of exploitation (6).,,,,,,,,,Jankowski's bunting,Rufous-backed bunting ,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Emberizidae,Emberiza (1),Emberiza (1),[],[],,,,,,,,,,Nilgiri laughingthrush,Rufous-breasted laughingthrush ,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Timaliidae,Garrulax (1),Garrulax (1),[],[],,,,,,,,,,rufous-breasted warbling finch,Rufous-breasted warbling-finch ,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Emberizidae,Poospiza (1),Poospiza (1),[],[],,,,,,,,,,Eleutherodactylus ruizi,Ruiz's robber frog ,Animalia,Chordata,Amphibia,Anura,Strabomantidae,Strabomantis (1),Strabomantis (1),[],[],,,,,,,,,,Dinagat batomys, Dinagat hairy-tailed rat,Russet batomys ,Animalia,Chordata,Mammalia,Rodentia,Muridae,Batomys (1),115 g (2),Information on the russet batomys is lacking but it is believed to have a small global population and to be declining as a result of habitat loss on Dinagat due to agriculture mining and illegal logging (1) (2). As with many islands in the region little of the original forest cover may now remain (7). This species is not thought to be very tolerant of habitat disturbance and its small and highly fragmented range puts it at even greater risk of extinction (1) but little information is available on its exact status (2).,There are not known to be any specific conservation measures currently in place for this poorly-known mammal.

Habitat loss is the main threat to this bird (2) with the island it inhabits losing 75 percent of its native vegetation cover since 1946 (7).  Cultivation and urbanisation have eliminated native forest from all but the steepest of slopes (2) and the high level of human population growth and economic development on R\xe9union Island has resulted in an increase in urbanisation road construction and tourism causing further habitat destruction (2) (4).  The natural habitat is also degraded by exotic plants making the land more susceptible to the impacts of cyclones heavy rains and fires (2).,There are a number of protected areas on R\xe9union Island and it is vital that the remaining suitable habitat for the R\xe9union harrier is protected from further degradation and that public awareness campaigns are developed in order to stop poaching and persecution (2) (7). Population trends need to be monitored and ecological research is required to determine the effects of forest clearance and aid conservation plans (2).,,,,,,,,,,CyprÌ¬s de Duprez, CyprÌ¬s de l'Atlas,Saharan cypress ,Plantae,Tracheophyta,Coniferopsida,Coniferales,Cupressaceae,Cupressus (1),Cupressus (1),[],[],,,,,,,,,St Lucia racer,Saint Lucia racer ,Animalia,Chordata,Reptilia,Squamata,Dipsadidae (1) (2),Liophis (3),Average snout-vent length: 55 cm (4)Average total length: 74cm (4)Average weight: 67 g (4),The West Indies is considered a biodiversity hotspot for reptiles with over 87 percent of snake species <strong>endemic</strong> to the region. However the region is also characterised by having some of the rarest snake species in the world many of which including the Saint Lucia racer are extremely close to extinction (12). Once widespread across the island of Saint Lucia and the neighbouring Maria Islands the introduction of small Asian mongooses (<em>Herpestes javanicus</em>) \xa0initiated a dramatic decline resulting in the complete extirpation of the species from the mainland restricting the species to its present day distribution (9) (13). As a ground dwelling diurnal snake the Saint Lucia racer is particularly vulnerable to predation by mongooses and consequently it now occupies a vulnerable position with a population that is critically small (5) (9) (13). \xa0,Facing the very real threat of extinction the survival of the Saint Lucia racer is dependant upon the implementation of major conservation measures. As it is restricted to the very small island of Maria Major along with a further six reptiles four of which\xa0 are Saint Lucian <strong>endemics</strong> the Saint Lucian government declared the Maria islands a nature reserve in 1982 (5) (14). As a direct result of this reserve wardens have been employed to take tourist tours to the island and to monitor activities on the island thus generating funds for conservation and ensuring the island\u2019s fragile environment is preserved (5). The Saint Lucia National Trust has also operated tours to the island with plans to revive this and efforts are underway to prevent exotic species establishing on the islands (5) (14).\xa0,,,,,,,,,,RÌ¢le d'Olivier,Sakalava rail ,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Gruiformes,Rallidae,Amaurornis (1),Length: 19 cm (2),Based on surveys conducted between 2003 and 2004 it is tentatively estimated that the Sakalava rail population numbers between 100 and 200 birds. For a species with so few individuals the rapid degradation and destruction of Madagascar\u2019s bio-diverse wetlands poses a very serious threat to its long-term survival. In Madagascar human encroachment and conversion of habitat for rice cultivation is widely responsible for a massive reduction in the area of wetlands. For the Sakalava rail the introduction of non-native fish and a decline in reed habitat partially attributable to harvesting by humans is likely to be having an additional negative impact (2). Fortunately the Sakalava rail is considered too small for hunting and in some areas it is even traditionally taboo to collect its eggs (2) (3).,In January 2007 the Madagascar government passed legislation granting the protection of the Mahavavy-Kinkony Wetlands a 300000 hectare wildlife area and home to all of western Madagascar\u2019s wetland birds including the Sakalava rail (5). Further to the statutory protection of such a large area of Sakalava rail habitat it is hoped that in the near future a national conservation plan specific to the species will be established. For the development of such a plan it is vital to gain a greater understanding of its ecology and distribution. Given that there are many areas with suitable habitat that have not yet been surveyed there is some optimism that the Sakalava rail population may be larger than the current estimates suggest (2).,,,,,,,,,,saker,Saker falcon ,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Falconiformes,Falconidae,Falco (1),Male length: 45 cm(2)Female length: 55 cm (2)Male wingspan: 100åÊ- 110 cm (2)Female wingspan: 120åÊ- 130 cm (2)Male weight: 730åÊ- 990 g (2)Female weight: 970åÊ- 1,300 g (2),The saker falcon has undergone a rapid decline in recent years particularly in the Middle East and Asia due to trapping for the falconry trade and now faces the very real threat of extinction (6). Of those captured for the falconry trade the vast majority are thought to be young females creating a major age and sex bias in the wild population that dramatically reduces its breeding potential (2) (6). Females are preferred by falconers due to their larger size and young birds because they are easier to train than adults (2). In Europe the saker falcon is mainly threatened by the loss and degradation of <strong>steppe</strong> and dry grassland habitat due to agricultural expansion and declines in sheep pastoralism which has in turn reduced the availability of key prey species and suitable hunting ground (6). Across the bird\u2019s range declines are also the result of predation (by eagle owls steppe eagles and golden eagles) human persecution electrocution shooting poaching and accidental poisoning through pesticides which contaminate the falcon\u2019s prey (2) (6) (7). In some parts of its range rodent plagues result in the extensive use of poisons to control them causing the indiscriminate deaths of many raptors that feed on them (5) (7).,The saker falcon is protected across much of its range particularly in Eastern Europe where controls of illegal trade were implemented in various countries in the 1990s (6). There have been concerted conservation efforts in Europe and intensive patrolling and management has even produced a steadily rising population in Hungary (5) (6). The species is listed on Appendix II of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) and in 2002 CITES imposed a trade ban on the United Arab Emirates (3). However more needs to be done to monitor illegal trade which evidently continues and to enforce regulations against it. Certain countries including the United Arab Emirates have reduced the demand for wild-caught birds by captive breeding \u2018farmed\u2019 saker falcons to trade to falconers instead (6). A programme to erect artificial nest platforms in the Mongolian steppe is proving a significant conservation measure for the breeding saker falcon population (7). Constructing artificial nests prevents the falcon constructing nests on electricity pylons during which many are electrocuted (8). In addition a number of research programmes have also been established to learn more about the distribution population and ecology of this species in addition to the threats facing it which should help to inform appropriate conservation efforts and management strategies in the future (6).,,,,,,,,,red-bellied harvest mouse, salt marsh harvest mouse,Saltmarsh harvest mouse ,Animalia,Chordata,Mammalia,Rodentia,Cricetidae,Reithrodontomys (1),7.6 - 14.5 g (3),The saltmarshes inhabited by this small mouse have undergone widespread destruction and degradation with many filled in for development or agriculture diked or used for commercial salt production. Groundwater pumping has also caused subsidence and increased flooding reducing the extent of pickleweed while predicted rising sea levels present a further flood risk (1) (2) (4) (8) (9). Most of the marshes have now been reduced to long narrow strips along outboard dikes lacking essential vegetation cover on higher ground. Pollution management for wildfowl invasive plants such as cordgrass (<i>Spartina</i>) and changes in water quality such as an influx of fresh water from sewage treatment have also changed the vegetation composition (1) (3) (4) (7) (8) (12). Finally within altered marshes the saltmarsh harvest mouse is at greater risk of predation by domestic cats and non-native red foxes (1) (4) and may suffer competition with the California vole (<i>Microtus californicus</i>) (13).,The saltmarsh harvest mouse is listed as Endangered by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (11) and occurs in a number of protected areas (1) (4) (8) (11) although many may not be large enough or have features suitable to its long-term survival (1) (8). A recovery plan for the species was completed in 1984 with the aim of protecting enhancing and restoring marsh habitat and undertaking further research into the species and its requirements (10) (14) and a Tidal Marsh Ecosystem Recovery Plan which will include this species is currently under development (1) (7). Some efforts are underway to preserve saltmarsh habitat for example through the removal of invasive <i>Spartina</i> (12) but a range of further measures will be needed including the effective protection and management of remaining marshland and more research into the saltmarsh harvest mouse if this unique rodent is to survive in the long-term (1) (8).,,,,,,,,,Salvin‰Ûªs salamander,Salvin's mushroomtongue salamander ,Animalia,Chordata,Amphibia,Caudata,Plethodontidae,Bolitoglossa (1),Snout-vent length: 51 - 68 mm (2) (3)Tail length: c. 51 mm (2),Salvin\u2019s mushroomtongue salamander was once relatively common but has undergone a decline as a result of the loss and fragmentation of its forest habitat mainly due to subsistence agriculture and wood extraction (1) (8). Since lungless salamanders need a damp environment to maintain the moist skin on which oxygen uptake depends (4) any alteration in moisture conditions poses a severe threat. Therefore although it still survives in shaded plantations and sugarcane fields any clearance of these to create more open drier habitats would have a negative impact on this species (1). Similarly climate change may also pose a threat and already appears to be causing dramatic declines in other Central American salamanders (12). Although there is not yet any direct evidence that the fungal disease chytridiomycosis has contributed to these declines its role in the decline of many other amphibian species suggests that it may also be a potential threat (12).,No specific conservation measures are currently known to be in place for Salvin\u2019s mushroomtongue salamander but the maintenance of shaded habitats has been identified as being important to its long-term survival (1). The species may potentially occur within the Parque Nacional El Imposible in El Salvador although this is not yet confirmed. It is not currently known from any protected areas in Guatemala but a number of protected areas have been proposed within its range and may benefit the species in the future (1).,,,,,,,,,,
