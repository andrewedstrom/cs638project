Antilope Blanche,Addax ,Animalia,Chordata,Mammalia,Cetartiodactyla,Bovidae,Addax (1),60 - 125 kg (2),The population of addax is today a mere fraction of what it once was and this dramatic decrease is mainly attributed to over-hunting. These slow-moving animals provide easy targets particularly with motorized vehicles and automatic weapons and their meat and leather are prized by local people (8). Other factors involved in the decline include <strong>desertification</strong> drought and habitat encroachment by pastoral expansion and subsistence agriculture (5) (10). It is estimated that fewer than five hundred individuals survive in the wild today with the bulk of these lying between the Termit area of Niger and the Bod\xe9l\xe9 region of Western Chad (9).,The addax is listed on Appendix I of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) thus prohibiting international trade (3). Provided effective protection is granted for the last remaining pockets of populations it is possible that the species can increase. With this in mind the Sahara Conservation Fund has developed a regional strategy that when implemented will protect the remaining wild populations and facilitate the recolonisation of neighbouring suitable habitats (10). A protected population exists in the Yotvata Hai-Bar (Wildlife Preserve) Nature Reserve in Israel to the north of Elat (11). The reserve was set up in 1968 with the view to bolster populations of endangered desert species (12). In Niger a vast protected area is being established in the Termit region to protect the largest remaining addax population in the wild (10). There are currently around 2000 individuals in captive populations around the world and these are being used in reintroduction programmes for the species in Tunisia and Morocco (7) (13) (14).

Ader's duiker, dwarf red duiker, Zanzibar duiker,Aders’ duiker ,Animalia,Chordata,Mammalia,Cetartiodactyla,Bovidae,Cephalophus (1),6.5 - 12 kg (2) (3),This rare duiker appears to have undergone a drastic population decline with estimates showing a decrease on Zanzibar from around 5000 individuals in 1982 to just 640 in 1999. The species is now restricted to a few forest patches in the south and east of the island where fewer than 300 may now survive\xa0(1)\xa0(4)\xa0(6). This decline is likely to be continuing with the main threats to the species being habitat loss due to illegal wood-cutting and the spread of agriculture and continued illegal hunting with the species being highly sought after for its meat and skin\xa0(1)\xa0(4)\xa0(5)\xa0(6)\xa0(9)\xa0(11). Deforestation and forest degradation has led to the severe fragmentation of the duiker\u2019s habitat but firewood collection unfortunately remains one of the few sources of income for many people living near the forests\xa0(1). An additional threat may be posed by the presence of feral dogs which are thought to have destroyed an introduced duiker population on Funzi Island\xa0(5).,Aders\u2019 duiker is a protected species in both Kenya and Zanzibar (1) although the law is often poorly enforced (9). A Species Recovery Plan is in place on Zanzibar with recommendations including improved protected status for the species the development of a new larger conservation area with a strict anti-hunting policy conservation education programmes continued population monitoring and further research into the species\u2019 behaviour and ecology (6). A conservation and recovery plan has also been proposed for Kenya (1). In 2000 five Aders\u2019 duikers were <strong>translocated</strong> to the well protected privately run conservation area of Chumbe Island where a female was already present but the success of this programme needs to be monitored (1) (4) (6). The possibility of a captive breeding programme is also being investigated (1) (3) (6) (11) while the use of trophy hunting as a conservation tool has been suggested but is controversial (1) (4) (6).

Animalia,Aeolian wall lizard ,Animalia,Chordata,Reptilia,Squamata,Lacertidae,Podarcis (1),,Reptiles in Europe and the Mediterranean face a number of severe threats and recent estimates suggest that over 40 percent of Europe\u2019s reptile populations are currently declining. The Aeolian wall lizard is one of six European lizard species to be classified as Critically Endangered (CR) by the IUCN Red List meaning that these species face an extremely high risk of extinction in the wild (9).\xa0,The Aeolian wall lizard is listed on Annex III of the Bern Convention which aims to protect European species and their habitats (11). Although the area in which this species occurs is classed as a World Heritage Site the Aeolian wall lizard is not found in any formally protected areas (1).

Equus asinus,African wild ass ,Animalia,Chordata,Mammalia,Perissodactyla,Equidae,Equus (1),275 kg (2),African wild asses have been captured for domestication for centuries and this together with <strong>interbreeding</strong> between wild and domestic animals has caused a distinct decline in population numbers (4). There are now only a few hundred individuals left in the wild (4) and the species is under threat of extinction. These animals are hunted for food and for traditional medicine in both Ethiopia and Somalia where recent civil unrest has led to an increased number of weapons in circulation. Competition with domestic livestock for grazing and restricted access to water supplies caused by agricultural developments pose further threats to the survival of this species (4).,The African wild ass is legally protected in the countries within which it is currently found (4) although these measures often prove difficult to enforce. More effective protection measures need to be adopted if the status of this species is to improve. A protected population of the Somali wild ass exists in the Yotvata Hai-Bar (Wildlife Preserve) Nature Reserve in Israel to the north of Elat (6). This reserve was established in 1968 with the view to bolster populations of endangered desert species (7). Populations of horses and asses are fairly resilient and if the species is properly protected it may well recover from its current low (5).

Flathead trout, Turkish trout,Ala balik ,Animalia,Chordata,Actinopterygii,Salmoniformes,Salmonidae,Salmo (1),up to 989 g (3),The ala balik faces several threats including the introduction of non-native trout species such as rainbow trout (<em>Oncorhynchus mykiss</em>) to its habitat (1) (3) (4). Rainbow trout are predators of the <strong>larvae</strong> of the ala balik and also act as competition for both food and space (1) (4).,Despite being classified as Critically Endangered on the IUCN Red List (1) and Endangered on the Endangered Species Act (1973) (2) (6) there are very few known conservation measures in place for this species (1) (6). Fishing of this species is officially prohibited and as such may afford the ala balik some protection (4).

Animalia,Alagoas foliage-gleaner ,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Furnariidae,Philydor (1),30 - 38 g (2),The Alagoas foliage gleaner has an extremely small population and a very restricted range. As a result of logging and the conversion of habitat for agriculture the area of forest at Murici in Alagoas the site of the Alagoas foliage-gleaner's discovery has declined by more than half since the 1970s. Furthermore the remaining habitat is highly fragmented. In Serra do Urubu in Pernambuco indiscriminate exploitation of natural resources especially for making charcoal has until recently been the main threat to the last remaining significant forest remnants (3) (5).,Despite being protected under Brazilian law the Alagoas foliage gleaner is facing the very imminent threat of extinction. Fortunately SAVE Brasil (formerly BirdLife International Brasil Program) is working to conserve habitat at both Murici in Alagoas and Serra do Urubu in Pernambuco. In 2001 international and national efforts led by SAVE Brasil resulted in the creation of the Murici Ecological Station in Alagoas. Covering over 6000 hectares of protected habitat work at Murici is currently overseen by seven conservation organisations that together with SAVE Brasil form the Muruci Pact (3) (5).

Alaotra reed lemur, Alaotran bamboo lemur, Bandro, Lac Alaotra bamboo lemur, Lake Alaotra gentle lemur,Alaotran gentle lemur ,Animalia,Chordata,Mammalia,Primates,Lemuridae,Hapalemur (1),Head-and-body length: 38 - 40 cm (2)Tail length: 39 - 41 cm (3)Male weight: 1.4 kg (3)Female weight: 1.6 kg (3),The Alaotran gentle lemur is extremely threatened due to its highly restricted range and specialised habitat. The area around Lac Alaotra is the largest area in Madagascar developed for rice cultivation and vast areas of the reed bed habitat have been burned and drained (1) to make way for paddy fields (6). In addition reeds are themselves harvested for products such as mats fish traps screens and fencing (6). The species is also under pressure from hunting both for food and for the pet trade (6); deliberate fires are sometimes lit to force fleeing lemurs into the path of hunters (3).,Lac Alaotra was declared a Ramsar site in 2003 with the aim of conserving biodiversity and the wetland ecosystem and there are also plans to create a strict conservation area covering the site. Public awareness campaigns have focused on the benefits of habitat conservation to the people living around the lake and a regional fishing convention bans lemur hunting and marsh burning (1). The Alaotran gentle lemur is protected from international trade by its listing on Appendix I of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) (4). There are currently small captive breeding programmes in several institutions including at the Durrell Conservation Trust in Jersey (1) (2) (7). The highly restricted nature of this species\u2019 distribution however means that it is vital that some of its habitat is protected to prevent yet another member of Madagascar's unique fauna from being lost.

Animalia,Amani flatwing ,Animalia,Arthropoda,Insecta,Odonata,Megapodagrionidae,Amanipodagrion (1),,The Amani flatwing is now critically endangered due to destruction and degradation of its habitat (1). There has been almost complete destruction of low-altitude forest across East Africa mainly for conversion to agricultural land (3) and the few remaining forests of the Eastern Arc Mountains where this species is found are under considerable pressure (5). While the main viable subpopulation of Amani flatwings is relatively safe within the Amani-Sigi Forest Reserve any other subpopulations within the vicinity are either already extinct or on the verge of extinction as a result of human encroachment forest destruction and water pollution. Even the protected population leads a relatively precarious existence containing fewer than an estimated 250 mature individuals (1).,The Eastern Arc forests of Tanzania contain many endangered species found nowhere else on Earth but remain under serious threat from an encroaching human population and are in immediate need of conservation action (5). Fortunately the stream around which the one remaining viable population lives is protected within a forest reserve in the East Usambara Conservation Area and is therefore relatively safe from any immediate danger (3). Nevertheless any changes to this stream could result in the extinction of the species and it has been advocated that an extensive survey of the whole area is urgently needed to locate any further remaining populations (1).

Animalia,American burying beetle ,Animalia,Arthropoda,Insecta,Coleoptera,Silphidae,Nicrophorus (1),Length: 2.5 - 3.8 cm (2),American burying beetles have been lost from the majority of their former range; populations in the east had largely disappeared by the 1920s whilst the decline in the American Midwest was well documented in the 1980s (2). One of the major causes of this decline in abundance is the fragmentation of available habitat; leading to changes in the availability of carrion increased competition and the isolation of remaining popualtions (2). ,The precarious sate of the population of American burying beetles was recognised in 1989 when the species was listed as Endangered on the U.S. Fish &amp; Wildlife Service Endangered Species List (3). A Recovery Plan has been drawn up and searches for remnant populations are underway (2). In Rhode Island and Oklahoma the known populations are monitored and their habitats managed and in Massachusetts a number of beetles from a captive population at Boston University have been released (2).

Animalia,Amsterdam albatross ,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Procellariiformes,Diomedeidae,Diomedea (1),4.8 – 8.0 kg (2),This rare albatross has been imperilled by a number of human and non-human related activities and now clings to an extremely precarious existence of just 70 to 90 individuals and 10 to 20 annually breeding pairs (2) (7). A large herd of 1200 feral cattle have destroyed the vegetation cover at lower altitudes on Amsterdam Island reducing this species\u2019 available breeding ground. Introduced predators also pose a major threat particularly feral cats and Amsterdam Island has suffered from fires started by humans which destroy vegetation and possibly birds (2) (9). The effects of longline fisheries around the island in the 1970s and early 1980s may also be to blame for the serious decline in numbers (4) (10). Although population numbers have recently been increasing a continued decline is projected owing to the potential spread of certain diseases (Avian cholera and <i>Erysipelothrix rhusiopathidae</i>) that affect the Indian yellow-nosed albatross (<i>Thalassarche carteri</i>) population on the same island (1) (4). Indeed increased chick mortality over recent years suggests that the Amsterdam albatross population has already been affected (4).,The Amsterdam albatross is listed on Appendix I on the Convention on Migratory Species (CMS) which strives towards protecting migratory animals conserving or restoring their habitat and controlling factors that might endanger them (3). It is also on Annex 1 of the Agreement on the Conservation of Albatrosses and Petrels (ACAP) (11). All Amsterdam albatrosses are banded and the population is monitored every year. In 1987 the number of cattle was reduced and a fence erected to partition off part of the island and in 1992 a second fence was built to provide complete protection from cattle in the high plateau (4) (9). Access to the colony by humans is also now under strict control (2). Further proposals include the management of vegetation to increase suitable nesting ground investigation into the impact of cats and means of removing these predators raising awareness of <strong>bycatch</strong> problems amongst longline fishers and research into methods of preventing the spread of disease (4) (10). All these issues need to be urgently addressed if we are to ensure the future of this bird which is one of the rarest and most endangered of all albatrosses and currently in grave danger of extinction.

Anegada Island iguana, Anegada rock iguana,Anegada ground iguana ,Animalia,Chordata,Reptilia,Squamata,Iguanidae,Cyclura (1),Male snout-to-vent length: to 560 mmFemale snout-to-vent length: to 500 mmMale weight: 7.75 kgFemale weight: 5.25 kg (2),Anegada ground iguana populations have undergone a drastic decline in recent decades leaving possibly fewer than 200 total individuals teetering on the brink of extinction (5). The drop in numbers is probably attributable to a range of threats including habitat loss and poaching by hunters who are trafficking exotic animals (2). Most devastating however has been the introduction of alien species (5). Feral dogs first reported in 1994 are known to kill adult iguanas and predation by an exploding population of feral cats on juveniles is responsible for the deaths of many hatchlings each year (2) (5). The primary threat however comes from competition for food from feral livestock with the island teeming with sheep goats donkeys and cattle that have been released to roam freely across Anegada (2) (4). Grazing pressure from these livestock has radically changed the composition of vegetation available to the iguana shifting the species\u2019 diet to rely more on plants with secondary compounds with dubious nutritional value (2).,The Anegada Iguana Recovery Programme began in 1997 which included establishing a \u2018headstart\u2019 facility. This facility collects hatchlings and nurtures them in captivity until they can be safely released into the wild with the aim of combating the high rates of juvenile mortality due to cat predation by raising them until they are large enough that predation will not pose as great a threat (6). The first 24 were released into the wild in October 2003 with an 84 percent survival rate and a second group of 24 were released in October 2004 and these are currently being tracked (5). In the 1980s small numbers of these iguanas were removed from Anegada and restored to parts of their former range on Guana Island where the species appears to be doing well in the absence of introduced predators (1) (2). The Guana Island Wildlife Sanctuary continues to try to rid the island of sheep the only feral grazing competitor on the island which may improve the habitat there for the iguanas (1). The species was also later introduced to Necker Island (2). A national park designed to protect this Critically Endangered iguana on Anegada has been approved in principle by the Anegada Lands Committee but rampant debates over land ownership and property boundaries impede developments and must be resolved before this project can progress (2) (4). Further conservation actions advocated include a cat eradication programme and the construction of fences around protected areas to keep livestock out. Indeed despite the successes of the headstart programme it is imperative that efforts are made to control livestock and to secure protected land for the survival of this species. Without prompt action it has been suggested that these iguanas may become extinct on Anegada within the next decade (2).

Ange, Ange De Mer, Angel, Antjou, Bourgeois, Bourget, L'anelot, L'ange, Martrame, Mordacle, Squatine Occelee,Angel shark ,Animalia,Chordata,Chondrichthyes,Squatiniformes,Squatinidae,Squatina (1),Length: up to 244 cm (2),The angel shark is not particularly sought after by fisheries and since 1989 catches have only been reported from Tunisia. The small numbers caught are utilised for human consumption and possibly also used for oil and fishmeal (5). A more widespread potential threat is the capture of this species as by-catch (5). As they lie on the bottom angel sharks are particularly vulnerable to <strong>by-catch</strong> in trawl fisheries an activity that has increased in the last 50 years. As a result numbers of angel sharks have declined dramatically and have even been declared extinct in the North Sea (1).,All <i>Squatina</i> species are protected within three Balearic Islands marine reserves where fishing for these species is forbidden (1). The status of the angel shark in many parts of its range is unknown (1) and the impact of fisheries is unclear (5) and thus research is required and conservation measures urgently need to be implemented (1) to assure the conservation of this unusual and distinctive shark.

The tiny population of these turtles is also under constant threat from unsustainable hunting and illegal trade. There is a massive demand for this species from markets in China where they can often be found for sale as meat or traditional \u2018medicine\u2019 (2) (4).,The Annam leaf turtle is protected under Vietnam\u2019s wildlife protection law (4) and is also listed under Appendix II of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) which means that international trade in this species should be carefully monitored (3). Despite trade in this species being illegal the law is often poorly enforced and trade still continues (4). Various breeding programmes have recently been set up and captive populations are increasing. These programmes try to involve local school and university students to help boost local awareness of this Critically Endangered turtle\u2019s perilous situation (7) (9).

Black and brown rats (<i>Rattus rattus</i> and <i>Rattus norvegicus</i>) were accidentally brought to the West Indies on foreign ships from Europe wreaking havoc on <strong>endemic</strong> wildlife including the Antiguan racer whose eggs and young were preyed upon (4). Then in the late 19th Century the small Indian mongoose (<i>Herpestes javanicus</i>) was introduced in an effort to control rat populations in sugar cane plantations. These quickly established themselves and systematically drove many species of terrestrial reptiles and ground-nesting birds to extinction or near-extinction amongst them the Antiguan racer (5). To make matters worse many Antiguans and visiting tourists wrongly believed the racer to be dangerous and snakes were often killed on sight (3).,In 1989 the believed extinct Antiguan racer was rediscovered on Great Bird Island where it was indeed facing imminent extinction. By 1995 only about 60 racers survived and most had been severely injured by rats (3). A conservation initiative sprang into action to save this species; Fauna and Flora International the Antigua Forestry Unit the Island Resources Foundation the Durrell Wildlife Conservation Trust the Environmental Awareness Group and Black Hills State University joined forces to create the Antiguan Racer Conservation Project (2). This award-winning project led to the eradication of rats and mongooses from Great Bird Island and 11 other offshore islands an extensive study programme and a very active education initiative for local people and visiting tourists (2).

It is facing increasing fragmentation of populations due to damming of the river in which they are <strong>endemic</strong> to produce hydroelectric power (8).,The plight of the apron has been recognised internationally by the European Union and its habitat has now been protected (9). Conservation measures also include a ban on catching this fish and there are proposals to reintroduce the apron into parts of the river to reduce the fragmentation of the population (4) (8).

Animalia,Arabian leopard ,Animalia,Chordata,Mammalia,Carnivora,Felidae,Panthera (1),Head-and-body length: 1.3 m (2)Male weight: 30 kg (4)Female weight: 20 kg (4),The Arabian leopard clings to a desperately precarious existence. With an official estimate of probably no more than 250 mature individuals and a declining trend this cat edges ever closer to the jaws of extinction (6). Habitat loss poses a serious threat largely as the result of overgrazing by livestock (2) which has also contributed to the depletion of the leopard\u2019s prey base (7). Hunting of both the leopard and its prey has also had a dramatic impact on the cat\u2019s survival contributing to it becoming one of the rarest animals in the world today (4). The leopards in Yemen are under particular pressure from hunting persecution from local shepherds and capture for trade (7) threats that are thought to be the main contributors to the species\u2019 demise (8). Sadly significant conflict arises from many people considering the leopard to be a threat to their domestic stock (8) with leopards probably often being blamed for kills by wolves and unexplained livestock losses (9).,Fortunately the situation is much more hopeful in Oman than in Yemen with the leopards of the Dhofar Mountains benefiting from comprehensive conservation measures (8). The first significant step to conserve the Arabian leopard was taken in 1985 when the region\u2019s first captive breeding group was established at the Omani Mammal Breeding Centre in Muscat (8). Since then captive breeding efforts at a number of institutions have been successful with several cubs born at the Breeding Centre for Endangered Arabian Wildlife in Sharjah United Arab Emirates. Such captive breeding programmes are essential in maintaining genetic diversity and saving this species from extinction (4). Nevertheless these successes need to be matched by equal successes in conservation efforts <glos><i>in-situ </i></glos>(2) without which potential reintroductions into the wild would be destined to fail (6).

Geoemyda arakana, Geoemyda depressa,Arakan forest turtle ,Animalia,Chordata,Reptilia,Testudines,Bataguridae,Heosemys (1),Carapace length: to 26.3 cm (2),The greatest threat thought to face the Arakan forest turtle is over-collection from the wild both for local consumption and commercial export to the Asian food markets particularly those of China and Thailand (5)\xa0(7). Not only are these turtles consumed but their shells are also sold for traditional medicinal use (5). Hunting usually involves using trained dogs to search out the turtles but limited burning of bamboo forests to intercept and capture fleeing turtles also takes place. Fortunately the market demand for this species is relatively low and current harvesting levels are thought to be minimal. Extensive tracts of habitat remain and the human population density of the region is amongst the lowest in Southeast Asia (6). Nevertheless habitat loss and degradation may represent additional threats due to logging operations road construction forest clearance for agriculture large-scale bamboo harvesting for a proposed paper mill and uncontrolled forest fires (5) (6). Furthermore this turtle\u2019s restricted geographic range low population density late onset of sexual maturity and low reproductive output render it vulnerable to overexploitation (5) (6). These combined threats have left the species in grave danger of extinction so much so that it was officially recognised in 2003 as one of the world\u2019s top 25 most endangered turtles (4).,The Arakan forest turtle is listed as a Protected Species in the Protection of Wildlife Wild Plants and Conservation of Natural Areas Law of Myanmar which was enacted in 1994. Furthermore two large areas in the Arakan Yoma Hill range Thanlwe-ma-e-chaung and Taungup Pass/Thandwe-chaung have been proposed for official protected status. These areas are found just south of known Arakan forest turtle inhabited zones and possess similar habitat types as those currently used by the species (5). This turtle may already occur in the vicinity of these proposed protected areas although no records exist or could potentially be introduced to the regions should they be given protected status. Good numbers of this species exist in captivity where attempts are being made to better understand its biology which could help to guide effective conservation plans or possibly even lead to captive breeding and reintroduction programmes in the future (4). In the meantime captive stock acts as an insurance population that buffers against total extinction. Nevertheless it is imperative that every effort is now made to protect this little-known species which managed to elude detection for so long if we are to prevent it from disappearing from the wild forever.

Animalia,Araripe manakin ,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Piridae,Antilophia (1),Length: 14.5 cm (2),Although the threats facing this species are not yet fully known it is thought that habitat loss and degradation as a result of human encroachment for development and recreation as well as clearance for agriculture (particularly banana maize beans and tomatoes) and cattle is the main threat (2). The chapada region has suffered intense human pressure recently and the locality at which the species was first described has been turned into a recreational park. The species does still occur in the area but the effects of the resulting influx of humans is unknown (4).,The location at which this beautiful bird is found is within the Araripe National Forest and a larger Environmental Protection Area but these designations do not prevent disturbance or exploitation (2). It is imperative that this area is designated as a biological reserve or a national park (2). Thankfully the owner of the land next to the type locality resolved to protect the habitat after this species was discovered. A project supported by the British Petroleum Conservation Leadership Programme is underway to shed light on the ecology of this species and to assess the main threats facing it as well as opportunities for its conservation (4). Urgent action must be taken if this critically endangered and recently discovered species is to escape extinction (2).

Armeria purpurea,Armeria ,Plantae,Tracheophyta,Magnoliopsida,Plumbaginales,Plumbaginaceae,Armeria (1),Height: 25 - 45 cm (2),At the start of the 20th century <em>Armeria helodes</em> was widespread across around 60 square kilometres of wetlands. However its habitat has been severely reduced and fragmented and <em>Armeria helodes</em> is now restricted to seven isolated subpopulations in the few remaining habitat patches. Each subpopulation contains just five to ten mature plants and <em>Armeria helodes</em> is considered to be at high risk of extinction (1) (4) (7).,<em>Armeria helodes</em> is classified as \xe2\x80\x98Critically Endangered\xe2\x80\x99 in Italy (1) (2) and is listed as an important species in Annex II of the EU Habitats Directive which aims to protect habitats and species across Europe (8).

Arubian cascabel,Aruba Island rattlesnake ,Animalia,Chordata,Reptilia,Squamata,Viperidae,Crotalus (1),0.9 - 1.4 kg (2),This species is threatened because it only occurs on one small island where just ten square kilometres of habitat remains undisturbed. In past centuries much of the island\xe2\x80\x99s trees were cut down for charcoal and firewood removing this snake's shelter and prey (6). Recent threats include resort development on the island and other forms of human encroachment. Goats have been introduced and have wreaked havoc on the vegetation. This species is also caught and illegally exported for the pet trade (4).,The Government and people of Aruba do recognise this <strong>endemic</strong> species as important and have set aside a large area of interior land as protected habitat for this and other species (2). The American Zoo and Aquarium Association (AZA) Aruba Island rattlesnake Species Survival Plan (SSP) is currently building on the island\xe2\x80\x99s conservation efforts. Field research is being carried out to determine population size natural history traits and factors affecting the survival of the Aruba Island rattlesnake in order to best inform conservation efforts. There is also an ongoing public relations campaign to change local people\xe2\x80\x99s perceptions of this venomous snake (6). Captive breeding has also been initiated in zoos associated with the SSP program to increase population numbers and the genetic health of this threatened snake (4) (6).

Declines in colonies at Cross Hill have been attributed to the cottony cushion scale insect (<em>Icerya purchasi</em>) which has been introduced to the island (2). This spurge also suffers from competition with the introduced Mexican thorn (<em>Prosopis juliflora</em>) which spreads extremely rapidly (3).,Aspects of the ecology of the Ascension spurge are currently under investigation and a cultivated population has been established by Ascension Conservation (3).

white-rumped vulture,Asian white-backed vulture ,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Falconiformes,Accipitridae,Gyps (1),Length: 75 – 85 cm (2),The Asian white-backed vulture was once the commonest vulture in the Indian subcontinent and was abundant throughout its range (4). Populations in South East Asia had all but disappeared by the mid-20th century. These declines have been attributed to direct causes such as hunting and live capture as well as the indirect effects of a reduction in carrion as hygiene improved across the region (5). Having suffered an extremely rapid decline in numbers due to a previously unknown cause the Asian white-backed vulture is in danger of imminent extinction without immediate conservation action. By 2000 dead and dying <i>Gyps</i> vultures were being found so frequently in Nepal and India it was thought that they were suffering from an epidemic. The unnaturally high death toll was thought to be caused by a fatal virus but testing has revealed that vultures are suffering from kidney failure following the consumption of cattle that had previously been treated with the anti-inflammatory drug diclofenac (2). In fact the decline is a result of a lethal level of the drug in a small proportion of the <strong>ungulate</strong> carcasses available to vultures but as vultures travel long distances to reach <strong>carrion</strong> a considerable proportion of the population has been affected (6).,It is necessary to prevent exposure of vultures to livestock carcasses that have been contaminated with diclofenac and to find an alternative replacement drug (7). Government commitment to the control of the use of the drug is crucial but until it has been entirely removed from the environment a collaboration of bird protection organisations plan to take all Asian white-backed vultures into captivity for the next 20 to 30 years to avoid further deaths which would further reduce the chance of a successful recovery of this already rare species (7).

The fish has excellent quality flesh and has been at risk of spear-fishing for recreation and sport (2) (4).,During the 1980s there was an observed reduction in numbers within <strong>spawning</strong> aggregations of the Atlantic goliath grouper dropping from over 100 individuals per location to fewer than 10 individuals and numbers were suspected to have been reduced by 80 percent. This prompted legislative protection preventing fishing of this species. In the ten years following the implementation of the legislation numbers of individuals in each <strong>spawning</strong> aggregation rose to between 20 and 40 individuals (2).

Baltic sturgeon, common sturgeon,Atlantic sturgeon ,Animalia,Chordata,Actinopterygii,Acipenseriformes,Acipenseridae,Acipenser (1),up to 315 kg (2),These long-lived and slow-growing fish are very vulnerable to exploitation; the Atlantic sturgeon has been extensively fished for its highly prized flesh and for the eggs which are sold as caviar (6). The development of river systems in particular the construction of hydroelectric dams destroys the breeding habitat of this species and adults are no longer able to return to their <strong>natal</strong> rivers to breed (8). Today only a single reproductive population remains and the species is consequently extremely vulnerable to extinction (5).,The Atlantic sturgeon is protected from international trade by its listing on Appendix I of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) (3). A captive breeding programme (8) for the species is being undertaken with the long-term goal of reintroducing this 'dinosaur of the sea' to some of its former range.

Previously capture of this species for the international pet and research trade contributed to population declines but the axolotl now breeds well in captivity alleviating this threat. It was also captured for consumption by local people although numbers are now too low for this. The most significant threat to the axolotl is the increasing pollution of the lakes and canal system as Mexico City continues to grow (1). Land drainage flood control and sewage disposal methods from the 17th century to the present have all contributed to the destruction of the water system of Mexico City (3).,Recent stabilisation of axolotl numbers may be attributable to the restoration of the Parco Ecologico Xochimilco over the last 20 years. This protected area requires continued restoration to support the axolotl population which it is hoped may begin to increase with the introduction of captive-bred axolotls. The axolotl is protected under category Pr (special protection) by the government of Mexico (1).

Animalia,Baer’s pochard ,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Anseriformes,Anatidae,Aythya (1),Length: 41 - 46 cm (2),Shockingly surveys have shown that around half of the total wintering wildfowl of the middle and lower basins of the Yangtze River were killed each year by hunters through netting shooting and poisoning. This indiscriminate loss of birdlife impacts not only on those birds that are already deemed to be under threat but all other birds in the area. Whilst some <i>Aythya</i> species are not as vulnerable as the Baer\u2019s pochard hunters are usually unable to distinguish between them anyway and so cannot spare those individuals that may prove to be so important in maintaining a viable population of Baer\u2019s pochard. Eggs are also collected from nests and as well as the obvious drop in reproductive output this causes the breeding grounds become less suitable as a result of the disturbance causing other nests to be abandoned (4).,Killing this species is banned in Mongolia Hong Kong Myanmar and some provinces in China but the large-scale hunting methods used and the difficulty in distinguishing Baer\u2019s pochard from other duck species notably from the similar ferruginous duck (<i>Aythya nyroca</i>) make it difficult to enforce the laws. This and many other waterfowl species would benefit from a ban on the spring shooting of ducks in Russia and the creation of more protected areas in addition to those Baer\u2019s pochard already uses. The education of hunters as to the identification of threatened species may help and it is important that Baer\u2019s pochard is upgraded to become a nationally protected species in mainland China and is put on Schedule I of the Wildlife Act of India (4).

Bartsch’s iguana, Turks and Caicos ground iguana, Turks and Caicos iguana,Bahamas rock iguana ,Animalia,Chordata,Reptilia,Squamata,Iguanidae,Cyclura (1),Male snout-to-vent length: up to360 mm (2)Female snout-to-vent length: up to290 mm (2)Male weight: up to1.86 kg (2)Female weight: up to1.14 kg (2),At least 13 iguana subpopulations most on relatively large islands have disappeared over the last 20 years predominantly due to ongoing habitat loss and the spread of introduced or feral mammal predators with this decline apparently accelerating (1). The primary threat in the Turks and Caicos Islands is introduced mammals such as cats dogs and rats which managed to almost completely destroy one population of 5000 iguanas on Pine Cay in just three years (5). Worryingly feral cats have recently crossed a newly formed sand spit from Pine and Water Cay to Little Water Cay an important nature reserve that was previously cat-free. Feral livestock such as goats cows donkeys and horses also pose a significant threat through competing for food altering vegetation compositions of the islands and trampling soft substrates where these iguanas borrow and nest. Development for tourism is an increasing cause of habitat loss and an additional cause for concern. The population of the Bartsch\u2019s iguana subspecies on Booby Cay has been protected to a degree by the fact that the cay is not readily accessible from the settlements on Mayaguana minimising disturbance. The main immediate threat to this population on Booby Cay is the presence of goats which are over-browsing vegetation and causing extensive habitat degradation. Environmental catastrophes here such as hurricanes or storm surges also pose a very real danger (1).,Many of the Turks and Caicos Islands are protected by being encompassed in national parks nature reserves and sanctuaries a number of which support Bahamas rock iguana populations. Unfortunately many of these reserves still suffer from the effects of introduced mammals and few government resources have been allocated to maintain or enforce protection of non-marine parks (1). However the establishment of the National Trust for the Turks and Caicos Islands in 1994 has significantly increased the conservation of terrestrial wildlife. The National Trust has been granted stewardship of Little Water Cay and similar transfers of Little Ambergris and East Bay Cays are currently pending. On Little Water Cay boardwalks and observation towers have been constructed at two popular landing sites to reduce the damaging impacts of tourism and a visitation fee has been implemented with the proceeds going towards supporting conservation activities. A trapping programme to remove feral cats from Pine Water and (if necessary) Little Water Cays has also been established by the National Trust (5).

Chinese river dolphin, white flag dolphin, whitefin dolphin, Yangtze River dolphin,Baiji ,Animalia,Chordata,Mammalia,Cetartiodactyla,Lipotidae,Lipotes (1),Male length: up to 229 cm (2)Female length: up to 253 cm (2)Length at birth: 0.9 m (3),The Yangtze River is one of the world\u2019s busiest waterways (3) and is subject to a great range of human pressures that have had a devastating effect on the baiji. The main threat causing the decline of this species in recent years is illegal fishing using electricity which has accounted for 40 percent of known deaths. The dolphins have also become caught in fishing gear and engineering explosions used to keep navigation channels open are another source of mortality. Vessels carrying pesticides occasionally overturn causing poisoning of the ecosystem resulting in further deaths (6). An additional source of pollution comes from the 15.6 billion cubic meters of wastewater discharged into the Yangtze every year 80 percent of which is not treated. A huge volume of boat traffic uses the river; noise levels are high and boat strikes a possibility. Furthermore the banks of the Yangtze have been greatly modified in order to prevent flooding of adjacent land; such projects have great impacts on the ecosystem both during construction and from the resulting habitat changes. Dam construction has been shown to reduce the availability of fish which is exacerbated by over-fishing and pollution. The recent construction of the infamous Three Gorges Dam the largest dam in the world is likely to affect fish stocks and natural flooding patterns (2). For many years the baiji population is thought to have been very small which in itself may have caused serious problems; small populations often suffer low genetic fitness and are often less able to adapt to environmental changes (2).,In Chinese folklore the baiji is dubbed \u2018Goddess of the Yangtze\u2019 a beneficent animal once revered by the fishing people of the river. The species was declared a National Treasure of China and has been a protected species since 1975 (3). However this had very little effect on the population which continued to decline despite conservation efforts and legal protection. It was thought that the only chance to save the species from extinction would be to remove all of the surviving individuals from the Yangtze into the \u2018Baiji Semi-natural Reserve\u2019 which was created in 1992 (6). However since the unsuccessful search for any surviving baijis in 2006 it is unlikely that a captive breeding programme will now ever be possible (4). The World Conservation Union (IUCN) has now classified the baiji as Critically Endangered (Possibly Extinct); it cannot be definitively classified as Extinct until further surveys are undertaken (1). Sadly it seems that this goddess of the Yangtze will be the first <strong>cetacean</strong> species to become extinct in modern times as a result of human activities (5).

Puffinus puffinus mauretanicus, Puffinus yelkouan mauretanicus,Balearic shearwater ,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Procellariiformes,Procellariidae,Puffinus (1),Length: c. 33 cm (2),The Balearic shearwater is the most threatened seabird in the Mediterranean and one of the rarest seabirds in the world (8) (10). Indeed with an annual decline estimated at around eight percent this highly threatened seabird could go extinct within the next 40 years (10). At present the greatest threat to the Balearic shearwater is thought to be unnatural adult mortality (11)\xa0(12). On land this may be caused by predation by introduced cats rats and genets (<em>Geneta geneta</em>) and the species may have gone extinct on Cabrera Island as a result (6). At sea this species has a close association with trawlers from which it takes fish discards and mass mortality has been observed where fish lines have come too close to large groups of birds (2).\xa0,Recognising the tragic fate of the Balearic shearwater the Balearic Government introduced a recovery plan in 1997 which aimed to increase the population and its distribution to all suitable areas of habitat (6). The implementation of this plan has seen the eradication of rats from several nesting sites and the creation of three Special Protected Areas which protect all nesting areas (2). However despite these efforts addressing the high rate of mortality at sea remains a crucial factor in avoiding the extinction of this species (10). This majestic seabird is also benefiting from a large number of studies into its ecology population size distribution priority conservation areas and threats (2).

By 1990 illegal poaching had reduced Bali starling numbers to just 15 individuals (1) (3) (9) and by 2001 only 6 wild individuals remained (9).,The Bali starling is listed on Appendix I of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) which means that commercial trade in this bird is prohibited (5). In addition this species has been protected under Indonesian law since 1970 (1) (2) (9) and its entire remaining wild population occurs within Bali Barat National Park (1) (9).

Although the region is still relatively undisturbed Sianda creek and parts of Kataba creek have already been developed into canals reducing habitat availability for the fish. As the local human population increases it is likely that intensified agriculture will lead to pollution of the banded neolebias\u2019s habitat from fertilisers and herbicides. Deforestation will also be likely in the area surrounding the floodplain causing various negative effects on the local ecosystem (1).,There are currently no measures in place to protect the banded neolebias. However various strategies have been proposed including further study of its biology assessments of its population and analysis of its threats. In addition the creation of a protected area encompassing its range continual population monitoring and prevention of invasion by the Nile tilapia have been recommended (1). The banded neolebias is a tiny fish with no economic value (4) nevertheless as a unique component of Zambia\u2019s biodiversity its preservation is important.

Palmiste Piquant, Palmiste Rouge,Barbel palm ,Plantae,Tracheophyta,Liliopsida,Arecales,Palmae,Acanthophoenix (1),Height: up to 12 m (2),As a result of uncontrolled harvesting of palm heart as well as clearance for sugarcane plantations on R\xe9union the historically common wild populations of barbel palm have been reduced to small fragments which are perilously close to extinction (1) (2). The total wild population is believed to number just 1300 reproductive individuals with only 100 existing on Mauritius. The threat to this species is further compounded by the fact that its reproduction success and reestablishment is very poor. The reasons for this are currently unclear but are likely to be due to consumption of the palm\u2019s fruit and seedlings by introduced animals such as rats and pigs (2) (3).,In order to help preserve wild populations of barbel palm the Office National des For\xeats on R\xe9union has undertaken an extensive restoration programme (3). Their efforts may be aided by the recent discovery of a large population of this species on Rodrigues which has the potential to provide an abundance of plant material to establish new stocks (2) (3).

Plantae,Bastard quiver tree ,Plantae,Tracheophyta,Liliopsida,Liliales,Asphodelaceae,Aloe (1),Height: up to 10 m (2),Recent surveys of the bastard quiver tree in the Richtersveld region of the Northern Cape Province of South Africa as well as in Namibia suggest that there has been very little successful reproduction in the last 100 years. In addition many of the older trees are dying indicating that the population does not appear to be naturally regenerating (5) (7). The rarity of the bastard quiver tree may be partly attributed to their habitat; in harsh environments the problems of survival are amplified (5). Similar declines in population regeneration in sister species <i>Aloe dichotoma</i> (the quiver tree) have been attributed to climate change (8) and it is very likely that the bastard quiver tree is being affected similarly. These effects are worsened by the removal of plants by horticultural collectors as well as through herbivory by baboon porcupines rock rabbits and livestock which also trample young plants\xa0(4) (5) (7). Populations may also be affected by damage caused by leaf scale insects and by base metal mining in Namibia (9).,Bastard quiver trees are protected in South Africa and Namibia (10) and are listed on Appendix I of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) effectively banning international trade in wild plants of this species (1). Further research into this important species is vitally needed together with the careful monitoring of existing populations (5). Bastard quiver trees are a vital component of the <strong>Succulent Karoo</strong> ecosystem and an important tourist draw to the region thus making conservation efforts imperative for the area.

tuntong,Batagur ,Animalia,Chordata,Reptilia,Testudines,Bataguridae,Batagur (1),Length: up to 60 cm (2),Numbers of batagur have been decimated by the loss of habitat and the over-collection of both adults and eggs (5). Recently there has been an increase in the market for turtle meat and eggs in Asia and the resulting unsustainable harvest has pushed many species to the brink of extinction (7). It is estimated that batugars in Malaysia declined by over 90% during the 20th Century (8) and the species is now considered to be Critically Endangered (1).,These turtles are listed on Appendix I of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) (3); international trade is thus prohibited although illegal collection is still widespread (1). The Bronx Zoo in New York has recently achieved the first captive breeding of batagurs and this may offer a glimmer of hope for the survival of this fascinating turtle (5).

Bawean hog deer, Kuhl’s deer, Kuhl’s hog deer,Bawean deer ,Animalia,Chordata,Mammalia,Cetartiodactyla,Cervidae,Axis (1),Shoulder height: 65 cm (2),In the past this diminutive deer was hunted by local people for its meat.  Hunting was particularly rampant during the 1960s when large areas of forest were cut down to plant teak affording hunters easier access (7).  Around 1977 hunting of the Bawean deer diminished giving populations the respite they needed to recover slightly (7).,In 1979 the Bawean Island Nature Reserve was established (7) offering the mountainous habitat of the Bawean deer some much needed protection.  Management activities on the island have included protecting the deer from hunting the controlled burning of grasslands to provide deer habitat and the thinning of teak plantations to encourage understorey development on which the deer can browse (7) (9).  The removal of wild dogs has also been recommended (9).  A number of Bawean deer also occur in zoos around the world (4) acting as a safeguard against this species extinction should the worst happen on Bawean Island.

In some areas the effects of intense habitat disturbance are exacerbated by hunting pressure (11); bearded sakis are hunted for <strong>bushmeat</strong> (12) and their tails are reportedly used as dusters (7).  This perilous combination of habitat destruction and hunting along with the bearded saki\u2019s specialised diet and preference for undisturbed forest (7) has led some to regard the bearded saki as the most endangered primate in the Amazon (4).,The bearded saki is listed on Appendix II of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) meaning that any international trade in this species should be carefully monitored (3).  However to ensure the future survival of this highly threatened primate adequately protected reserves and a captive breeding programme are said to be urgently required (7).

Animalia,Bekko tombo ,Animalia,Arthropoda,Insecta,Odonata,Libellulidae,Libellula (1),,Once relatively abundant bekko tombo populations have undergone drastic declines in recent decades as a result of habitat destruction and degradation and introduced predators. Ponds have been filled to allow urban expansion or in some urban areas ponds have been made into artificial ponds with concrete banks which may be unsuitable for this species. Likewise grassy fields which females and immature males rely upon for refuges have greatly diminished in recent years (1). Introduced alien species such as <i>Procambarus clarkii</i> (Crustacea) <i>Micropterus salmoides</i> (carnivorous fish) and <i>Myocastor coypus</i> (a large semi-aquatic rodent) have also contributed to the dragonfly\u2019s demise either through direct predation or through feeding on the water plants that sustain this native species (1) (5). Sadly the pattern of decline is only expected to continue (1).,Considered a national natural treasure in Japan (5) the bekko tombo became protected by the Japanese Ministry of Environment in 1993 and collection is prohibited by law (1). Nevertheless this does little to protect the dragonfly\u2019s disappearing habitat (1). Thus some <strong>NGOs</strong> have begun to conserve this insect and its habitat at specific pond sites for example at Okegaya Imuta Misumi and Noyori-shin ponds (1) (6). At Misumi Pond the Oita Dragonfly Society is feeding and breeding the larvae of bekko tombo to help restore the diminished population with 149 larvae successfully hatching in spring 2005 in tanks installed in the pond. The Oita Dragonfly Society is also observing the mating and egg-laying behaviour of females with the hope that the information gained will help them in their breeding scheme (6). Thus despite an ongoing decline national pride in this native dragonfly provides an element of hope for its future in Japan at least through inspiring concerted conservation efforts by dedicated individuals and organisations such as the Oita Dragonfly Society.

As only one population of <em>Belgrandiella bachkovensis</em> is known it is extremely vulnerable. Pollution from upstream agriculture has previously caused damage to its habitat and therefore poses a major threat to this species (1) (2).,There are no known specific conservation measures currently in place for <em>Belgrandiella bachkovensis</em>. Pollution management could be enforced to help protect its population and future monitoring of the habitat is needed to maintain its quality (1).

great sturgeon,Beluga ,Animalia,Chordata,Actinopterygii,Acipenseriformes,Acipenseridae,Huso (1),Up to: 2,072 kg (3)Length: 1 - 3 (max = 5 m) (2),Sturgeon have survived since the time of the dinosaurs but some populations of the beluga are today threatened with commercial extinction principally as a result of overfishing (9). The eggs are highly prized as caviar for both their quality and quantity (4). The beluga is the most famous of the caviar sturgeons and is featured in the Guinness Book of Records as the most expensive fish (3). Previously effective management of Caspian Sea fisheries have recently collapsed and illegal fishing is now rife; the U.S Fish and Wildlife Service estimated in 1998 that more than 50 percent\xa0of worldwide caviar trade was illegal (9). In addition habitat destruction through the pollution of coastal habitats and the alteration of river systems through dams pollution and silting have further affected beluga numbers (4). The Volgograd Dam for example has blocked almost all beluga spawning grounds (9).,The Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) (7) imposed a six-month ban on sturgeon catches in June 2001 but conservationists are concerned that this has not gone far enough to save the beluga sturgeon (6). The majority of the sturgeon population is now supported artificially (8); hatcheries may be the sole reason belugas still persist in the Caspian Sea (9). The United States is the biggest importer of caviar and the Fish and Wildlife Service is currently considering listing the species under the Endangered Species Act effectively banning importation (6) but time is running out in the fight to save this ancient fish

Eupodotis bengalensis,Bengal florican ,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Gruiformes,Otididae,Houbaropsis (1),Male length: 64 cm (2)Female length: 68 cm (2)Male weight: 1250 – 1700 g (2)Female weight: 1700 – 2250 g (2),The most significant threat to the Bengal florican is the loss and alteration of its grassland habitat.  Grasslands throughout its range are threatened by drainage conversion to agriculture overgrazing heavy flooding and inappropriate cutting and burning regimes (6).  The Tonle Sap grasslands an extremely important area for breeding Bengal floricans have declined by 60 percent since the late 1990s with the intensification of rice cultivation playing a significant role in this loss in recent years (7).  However not all human activity should be looked upon as negative as many grasslands in the absence of large native herbivores rely on activities such as grazing and burning for their existence (7).  Unfortunately reaching the correct balance of human activities is not an easy task and the management of many grasslands even those within protected areas results in habitat unsuitable for the Bengal florican (8).,The Bengal florican occurs in a number of protected areas including the Royal Chitwan National Park and Royal Bardia National Park in Nepal (8) Dudwa National Park in India and possibly in Tram Chim National Park Vietnam and Ang Trapeang Thmor Sarus Crane Conservation Area in Cambodia (6).  Within some of these areas efforts are underway to maintain the valuable grasslands such as uprooting woody vegetation (8) and a schedule of controlled fires and the collection of cut grass by locals for thatch (8) (10).  This will help create more suitable habitat for the Bengal florican (8) provided that burning and cutting is carried out before the breeding season otherwise these activities could be detrimental to the eggs or young birds (4) (10).  The worrying loss of grassland habitat in the Tonle Sap led to the designation in 2006 of 310 square kilometres of land as Integrated Farming and Biodiversity Areas.  Within these areas large scale habitat conversion is forbidden but extensive traditional use is encouraged (7).

These steps are vital if an effective conservation management strategy is to be put into action. Data on population numbers and distribution is also severely lacking and people in Bermuda are encouraged to keep a vigilant eye out for the species (3). BAMZ is also developing captive breeding techniques that may prove vital for supplying individuals for a possible reintroduction campaign (3).

Plantae,Biznaguita ,Plantae,Tracheophyta,Magnoliopsida,Caryophyllales,Cactaceae,Mammillaria (1),Stem diameter: 25 cm (2),This highly attractive and unusual cactus is extremely popular with collectors and the location of the single population is well known (1). It is estimated that the number of Biznaguitas in the wild has declined by as much as 75% since its discovery in the mid-1980s principally as a result of over-collection (1). ,In recognition of the worrying population decline the Biznaguita was upgraded to Critically Endangered on the World Conservation Union's (IUCN) 2002 Red List of Threatened Species (1). This cactus is listed on Appendix II of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) (3) thus restricting trade in wild plants; however a greater enforcement of these restrictions is required if this attractive cactus is to remain in the wild (1).

Animalia,Black abalone ,Animalia,Mollusca,Gastropoda,Archaeogastropoda,Haliotidae,Haliotis (1),Length: 20 cm (2),The black abalone has suffered a serious decline since 1985 due to a disease known as withering syndrome which spread through the California Channel Islands between 1985 and 1992. It causes wasting of the foot muscle preventing the abalone from properly adhering to a rock causing the abalone to become discoloured lose weight and die. Population losses in each area ranged from 20% to total (1).,All abalone fisheries in California are managed by the California Department of Fish and Game which restricts the size of abalones caught and the season in which harvesting can take place. In Mexico there is a total allowable catch limit for black abalones. The black abalone is a candidate species on the US Endangered Species Act and whilst this could be beneficial in the future it does not currently give the species any legal protection (1).

Rhinocéros Noir,Black rhinoceros ,Animalia,Chordata,Mammalia,Perissodactyla,Rhinocerotidae,Diceros (1),800 - 1,400 kg (2),Black rhinoceros have been poached to the brink of extinction due to the demand for their horn both for use in Chinese traditional medicine and for traditional dagger handles in Yemen the demand for which exploded in the 1970s due to the increased income of oil-rich Gulf States (7). It is estimated that between 1970 and 1992 around 96 percent of the black rhinoceros population was lost (8).,The population crash in the latter half of the 20th Century saw rhinoceros numbers plummet to a low of about 2400 individuals (4). A variety of conservation approaches have been adopted which have resulted in the stabilisation and partial recovery of populations in a number of countries. The most successful have involved the rigorous protection of rhinoceros in fenced sanctuaries often in partnerships between the State and private sectors or in intensely protected unfenced zones within larger areas (4). Dehorning has also been used in some countries to reduce the incentives to poach (4). In 1997 Yemen became a signatory of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) thus greatly reducing the demand for rhinoceros horn in the Middle East (7). By 2001 the continental black rhinoceros population had increased to 3100 with populations in six of the eight range states increasing (4). Most individuals are conserved in heavily protected areas. The African Rhino Specialist Group of the World Conservation Union (IUCN) provides advice on the conservation of African rhinoceros and has developed a detailed Action Plan which provides extensive information and strategic direction for their conservation (4).

Giant sea bass,Black sea bass ,Animalia,Chordata,Actinopterygii,Perciformes,Polyprionidae,Stereolepis (1),up to 255.6 kg (2),The black sea bass has been massively over-fished in both California and Mexican waters leaving this water giant Critically Endangered. Indeed so dramatic were these declines that between 1932 and 1980 commercial landings diminished from 115 tonnes biomass to 5 tonnes in Californian waters and from 363 tonnes to 12 tonnes in Mexican waters. The species\u2019 limited distribution large size and aggregation in spawning areas made it an easy target for fisheries (1). Unfortunately its slow growth and late onset of sexual maturity make the fish extremely vulnerable to population collapses from over-fishing and slow to recover (5). Additionally it appears that the black sea bass may also be suffering from toxin poisoning. Sediments along the coast of California have been found to carry very high levels of toxins such as DDE and PCB with an area off the Palos Verdes peninsula thought to contain possibly the highest loads of DDE (a breakdown product of DDT) in the world\u2019s oceans. The toxins cannot be broken down so as a mid-level predator black sea bass ingest the cumulative toxins in increased concentrations from the food chain below it and have been found to be carrying extremely high body burdens of DDE and PCB in southern California. The chemicals have been recorded to interfere with normal reproductive biology in other species of fish as well as amphibians reptiles and birds but more research is needed into the effects they are having on this giant fish and its process of recovery in California (3).,The black sea bass has been protected in California since 1981 and in Mexico since 1992. Both commercial and recreational fishing of this species were prohibited in California in 1981 although two fish per angler per trip are allowed to be caught south of the U.S.-Mexican border and one fish per trip to be taken incidentally by commercial fishermen. The law also limited the amount of black sea bass that could be caught in Mexican waters and landed in California (1). Although these laws have prevented commercial fishermen from targeting and profiting from these fish they have failed to protect the habitats occupied by the species from fishing and have probably done little to reduce incidental mortality since black sea bass entangled in nets have simply been discarded back into the sea (5). Indeed many fish in spawning aggregations in the summer have been caught and released frequently receiving injuries in the process (6). However the banning of gill nets in California in 1990 has probably helped significantly reduce the incidental mortality of this species and anecdotal data suggest that numbers may be beginning to rebound (1) (5). Nevertheless either voluntary or imposed seasonal and/or area closures would undoubtedly help further minimise incidental mortalities and greatly aid the recovery of this magnificent and dramatic giant of the sea (3) (6).

Ruffed lemur,Black-and-white ruffed lemur ,Animalia,Chordata,Mammalia,Primates,Lemuridae,Varecia (1),3 – 4.5 kg (2),As with other lemur species the black-and-white ruffed lemur is threatened by habitat loss through logging agriculture mining and other development in Madagascar (1) (7). When human activities encroach upon rainforest habitat this species is one of the first lemurs to disappear (1). Hunting also threatens this rare primate; unfortunately its large size and daylight activity pattern makes it an attractive target and it is among the most heavily hunted of all Madagascar\u2019s lemurs (1).,The black-and-white ruffed lemur occurs in a number of protected areas such as Mananara-Nord National Park Zahamena National Park and Mantadia National Park. Although sadly this Critically Endangered species has also vanished from other areas such as Analamazaotra Special Reserve and Andringitra National Park and other forests urgently require protection if this species is to survive (1). The black-and-white lemur has been the subject of captive breeding efforts with a number being reintroduced to Madagascar\u2019s Betampona Reserve between 1997 and 2001 (1) (9). Unfortunately this has had limited success as animals that have not grown up in the wild typically have great difficulty adapting (9). Reintroduction is a long and costly process (9) and is rendered worthless if there is no safe natural habitat in which they can be released into. Thus hopefully efforts to protect Madagascar\u2019s habitats by numerous conservation organisations will be successful.

Gibbons throughout the region have undergone dramatic declines due principally to this habitat loss but also as a result of hunting (4). The fragmentation of their habitat causes groups to become separated from the remaining population (2) and it is estimated that about 75 percent of the black crested gibbon\u2019s original habitat has already been lost (9). The taxonomic confusion surrounding this species makes population estimates particularly difficult but at least two of the subspecies are today at critically low levels (1).,The black-crested gibbon is protected from international trade by its listing on Appendix I of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) (3). Fauna and Flora International (FFI) have been studying the species in Northern Vietnam since 1999. They have also been involved in a community awareness programmes in the area and there is pressure to designate the last stronghold of the species (the Che Tao Forest) as a Gibbon Sanctuary (4). In China the largest population of the Central Yunnan black crested gibbon subspecies occurs within the Wuliang Mountain National Reserve (4). It is vital that any remaining viable populations and habitats are protected or this previously successful ape is in grave danger of disappearing.

Animalia,Black-eared mantella ,Animalia,Chordata,Amphibia,Anura,Mantellidae,Mantella (1),Length: 15 – 18 mm (2),As for many Madagascan frogs the threats to this species are serious and numerous. Having suffered massive over-collection for the pet trade in the past the black-eared mantella is now threatened by habitat loss due to increasing subsistence agriculture timber extraction charcoal manufacture livestock grazing fires human settlement and the spread of introduced eucalyptus species (1). Current studies are in act to provide a revised distribution map of the species. The abundance at some of these sites appears anyhow high enough to warrant the survivorship of the species (4).,For this species to persist trade must be carefully regulated. The black-eared mantella is currently listed on Appendix II of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species which bans trade without an export permit. It is not found in any protected habitat and deforestation is now the most serious threat (1).

Animalia,Black-faced lion tamarin ,Animalia,Chordata,Mammalia,Primates,Callitrichidae,Leontopithecus (1),540 – 710 g (2),Habitat loss as a result of development cultivation and the increase in tourism in the area as well as the capture of live individuals has posed a threat to the survival of the species (6).,The black-faced lion tamarin project aims to study the species and gather information on its ecology and behaviour (7). Findings will be used to inform conservation management programmes and raise awareness of the species through environmental education in the local area. Captive breeding programmes could also help this species enormously and are a priority for future conservation efforts (2). This tamarin is one of the world's 25 most endangered primates and is on the very brink of extinction. It will require long-term conservation efforts and protection if it is to survive.

A victim of extensive habitat loss this rare monkey survives in highly fragmented relict populations each numbering no more than 50 individuals (1). The blond titi monkey is only found in the Atlantic forests of Brazil a region characterised by intensive habitat conversion and degradation. Despite only ten percent of original forest remaining urban and agricultural encroachment and the development of coffee and sugarcane plantations continue to threaten the area. Rapid urbanisation also threatens the blond titi monkey through road collisions electrocution on power lines and predation by domestic pets. It may also be captured for use as pets (1).,Despite being home to numerous species found nowhere else in the world only one percent of the forests of Bahia home to the blond titi monkey are under any form of protection (9). As a number of destructive activities continue to degrade the area action is urgently required to protect the blond titi monkey\u2019s habitat. Thankfully several organisations including the Brazilian Institute for the Environment are working to promote the study and protection of Brazil\u2019s threatened primates (10). Conservation International is also helping to establish a Central Biodiversity Corridor that aims to connect fragmented forests while WWF is developing an overall conservation strategy for Brazil\u2019s Atlantic forests (9) (11). Further research is needed into the ecology and status of this enigmatic species if it is to be pulled back from the brink of extinction (1). \xa0\xa0

Blue-knobbed curassow,Blue-billed curassow ,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Galliformes,Cracidae,Crax (1),Size: 83 – 93 cm (2),The blue-billed curassow has been dramatically impacted by the rapid rate of deforestation across its range due to the expansion of agriculture cattle farming mining activities logging operations and human population growth (2) (6). The loss of habitat has been so extensive that little now remains (2). Additionally this species is prized by hunters and is particularly vulnerable during the breeding season because of the conspicuous vocalisations performed by the males making them easy to locate. At this time the eggs are also taken from the nests to incubate and rear for trade and consumption (6). Sadly loss and fragmentation of habitat only serves to facilitate easier access to the bird for poachers (2).,South America\u2019s newest nature reserve Reserva Natural El Paujil was established in 2004 by the Colombian bird conservation NGO Fundaci\xf3n ProAves (2) (7). It is in the Serran\xeda de las Quinchas the sole surviving block of Magdalena Valley Humid Forest. The reserve which is named after the local name for this species El Paujil is a major refuge for threatened <strong>endemic</strong> species and is thought to contain the most significant surviving population of the blue-billed curassow (7). Penalties have been introduced here for shooting or trapping species (2) and ProAves is planning to purchase a further 5000 ha of forest adjoining the reserve (7). Other reserves also exist such as the Bajo Cauca-Nech\xed Regional Reserve which has been recently declared and probably holds this species and the vast Paramillo National Park but no protective measures have been implemented here (2).

Courtois’s laughingthrush,Blue-crowned laughingthrush ,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Timaliidae,Garrulax (1),c. 50 g (3),The blue-crowned laughingthrush has an extremely small and fragmented range and its tiny wild population is thought to number only around 200 to 250 individuals.

Indeed the species was thought to have been lost from the wild until it was rediscovered in 1992 (2). Ironically the rarity of this species makes it even more desirable for collectors and the illegal trade appears to continue to this date (3). Surviving populations are extremely fragmented and vulnerable (2). Established land management practices including burning of under-storey in palm groves also mitigate against recovery of the population (6).,The blue-throated macaw is protected by law in Bolivia (2) and international trade is prohibited by its listing on Appendix I of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) (4). Illegal trade appears to continue however and it has been recommended that full-time guards may be required to halt this process (2). Problems arise however from the fact that much of this bird\u2019s range is on privately owned ranches (5). Research is also needed into the natural ecology of this species so that effective management plans can be implemented (2). Fortunately there are several organisations involved with the research and conservation of this bird and a Species Recovery Plan has now been formulated. NGO Armon\xeda Bolivia\u2019s BirdLife International partner also set up the Blue-throated Macaw Conservation Programme which they have worked on in conjunction with the Loro Parque Fundaci\xf3n to save this Critically Endangered bird. Incredibly in October 2004 this programme found a new disjunct population at Santa Rosa 100 kilometres west of previous records providing new hope that more blue-throated macaws exist in the wild than previously thought (6). The programme\u2019s important work on mapping the species assessing its numbers and threats in different areas will certainly help guide priority conservation decisions in the future and hopefully help bring this beautiful bird back from the brink of extinction (5).

Clemmys muhlenbergii,Bog turtle ,Animalia,Chordata,Reptilia,Testudines,Emydidae,Glyptemys (1),Length: up to 11.4 cm (2),The bog turtle faces numerous potential threats but the most significant and damaging is the loss alteration and fragmentation of its wetland habitat. Many areas are being drained dredged filled or flooded for urban development agriculture and pond and reservoir construction (4) (5). The loss and alteration of suitable habitat increases the risk of bog turtles being killed on roads and leaves them more exposed to predation (5). The impact of this habitat loss on bog turtle populations is being compounded by the illegal wildlife trade (5) as unfortunately the small size unique colouration and rarity of this turtle makes it highly valued in the pet trade (4).,Bog turtles are legally protected or regulated in nearly all states in which they occur (2) but most of these regulations relate just to the species and do not provide protection to its habitat (5). However many states are increasing efforts to conserve both bog turtles and their habitat and a number of wetland habitats containing turtle populations throughout the range are protected (5).

Logging not only removes lichen substrate but also alters the microclimate of the forest a factor to which this species is particularly susceptible (4). Owing to the impacts of habitat loss and air pollution the Atlantic population has declined by more than 90 percent over the past two decades (2) (3).,The Atlantic population of the boreal felt lichen is protected in Canada under the Federal Species at Risk Act (SARA) and is the focus of an ongoing recovery strategy (2). Crucially efforts are being made through land purchases and agreements with landowners to formally protect areas of forest that are home to this rare species (2) (3). Furthermore conservationists are engaging with private and government forest managers to encourage their participation in the mapping of boreal felt lichen habitat and the implementation of management plans that will prevent further habitat loss (2).

Bornean orang-utan,Bornean orangutan ,Animalia,Chordata,Mammalia,Primates,Hominidae,Pongo (1),Male head-body length: 97 cm (2)Female head-body length: 78 cm (2)Male weight: 60 - 90 kg (2)Female weight: 40 - 50 kg (2),In the past orangutans were hunted relentlessly in the majority of their Southeast Asian range with their large size and slow movements making them easy targets for hunters (9). However the main threat to orangutans today is loss of habitat. In the past twenty years 80 percent of orangutan habitat has been lost to illegal logging gold mining and conversion to permanent agriculture in particular oil palm plantations. Orangutans are extremely vulnerable to exploitation largely as a result of their extremely long inter-birth interval (8).,The Bornean orangutan is protected by law in both the Malaysian and Indonesian areas of the island and is listed on Appendix I of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) which prohibits international trade (3) (7). While some populations do occur within protected parks illegal logging even within protected areas remains a key threat to the survival of this species and has increased with political instability in Indonesia (2).

Pig nut palm,Bottle palm ,Plantae,Tracheophyta,Liliopsida,Arecales,Palmae,Hyophorbe (1),Height: 3.1 – 3.7 m (2)Leaf length: 3.1 m (2)
Leaflet length: 0.6 m (2),The palm savannah habitat still found on Round Island was once characteristic of the northern plain of Mauritius but this is now lost to development. As one of the few islands still free from introduced rats Round Island has a high conservation value. It supports many breeding seabirds as well as eight species of native reptile. It suffered following the introduction of goats and rabbits in the 19th century as their zealous over-grazing caused extreme soil erosion. In the 1970s the goats were successfully eradicated but the rabbits were more difficult to remove. As the destruction caused by the rabbits continued to increase into the 1980s Jersey Wildlife Preservation Trust funded three scientists who were challenged to exterminate the rabbits on Round Island. In just two months these scientists were able to poison every rabbit on the island and a year later in 1987 it was declared rabbit-free. Invasive weeds were also removed and native vegetation was found to be growing prolifically (3).,As one of the most successful and exemplary cases of conservation in the world Round Island is a managed reserve and is now preparing for the introduction of carefully chosen critically endangered animals and plants from Mauritius (3). Regeneration of the bottle palm will benefit immeasurably from the removal of goats and rabbits (1).

Animalia,Brazilian merganser ,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Anseriformes,Anatidae,Mergus (1),Size: 49 – 56 cm (2),The Brazilian merganser is extremely sensitive to habitat loss and degradation and has suffered badly from pollution siltation and disturbance of its rivers which has resulted largely from deforestation logging agricultural expansion cattle ranching human habitation hotel construction and in the Serra da Canastra area diamond-mining (3) (4) (7). Dam-building has also flooded suitable habitat especially in Brazil and Paraguay (4) and intensifying ecotourism activities such as rafting may become another threat in the future (3). Other threats include inbreeding hunting competition forest fires egg-collecting pesticides and predation (7). Fewer than 250 birds are thought to remain in the world with the vast majority in Brazil. In Argentina where very few individuals survive and extinction may be imminent hunting and collection of exhibition specimens is believed to have contributed to the species\u2019 decline (4).,This extremely rare bird occurs in three Brazilian national parks and in Argentina sections of the Arroyo Uruz\xfa are also protected within the Urugua\xed Provincial Park (4). Commercial diamond extraction was banned in the Serra da Canastra area in Brazil in 1996 (7). A Brazilian Merganser Recovery Team has been set up and a Brazilian Merganser action plan has been created which details priority conservation projects (8) (9). In line with these plans the Brazilian NGO Terra Brasilis has initiated a conservation program the world\u2019s most important site Serra da Canastra National Park in South Central Brazil (8) (9). The programme involves collecting basic information needed to adequately protect the species such as studies of its breeding ecology and an inventory of its distribution within the Canastra range as well as environmental education in both urban and rural areas (schoolchildren teachers farmers and other local people) and a campaign to market the species presence with the aim of ultimately making it a flagship species for the region (9). Nevertheless even despite these efforts there is a very real possibility of extinction in the wild becoming a reality and without being established in captivity this rare species would be lost to the world forever.

Copan Brook frog,Brook frog ,Animalia,Chordata,Amphibia,Anura,Hylidae,Duellmanohyla (1),Male snout-vent length: 26.8 – 32 mm (2)Female snout-vent length: 38 mm (2),Owing to agriculture logging and water pollution <em>Duellmanohyla soralia</em> is declining throughout its restricted range and the remaining populations are severely fragmented. Most recently the deadly amphibian fungal disease chytridiomycosis has been detected in the population with between 45 to 60 percent of all larvae infected (1)\xa0(2).,<em>Duellmanohyla soralia </em>occurs within two protected areas in Honduras Parque Nacional Cerro Azul and Parque Nacional Cusuco although habitat loss still continues in the latter. Given the spectre of fungal disease spreading through the entire population it is important that the population status of this Critically Endangered species is closely monitored\xa0(1)\xa0(2).

Compounding the threat of hunting is the impact of habitat loss; in Colombia it has been estimated that 30 percent of <em>Ateles fusciceps rufiventris\u2019 </em>habitat has been lost in the last ten years (1) and the population size of <em>Ateles fusciceps fusciceps</em> has decreased by 80 percent as a result of habitat loss (6).\xa0,Hunting of the brown-headed spider monkey is prohibited in Ecuador (5) and it also receives some protection from international trade under its listing on Appendix II of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) which means that any international trade in this species should be carefully regulated (4)<strong>. \xa0</strong>This species also occurs in several protected areas including Los Cedros Protected Forest in Ecuador and Los Katios Natural National Park in Colombia (1) which should hopefully protect some populations from the threat of habitat loss.

Historically this species was considered a pest and over three million were killed between 1880 and 1920 for bounty money (7). The introduction of predators and competitors such as foxes cats rats and rabbits combined with habitat reduction from farming and altered burning regimes have all had detrimental effects on the species (2).,The Critically Endangered brush-tailed bettong is reliant on the monitoring and reduction of fox populations as well as careful habitat management for its survival (7). Research is currently underway to identify possible new <strong>translocation</strong> sites (1) and an investigation is being carried out by the Woylie Conservation Research Project to discover why all large brush-tailed bettong populations across Australia dramatically declined in 2001. Predation disease and food availability are the main areas under investigation (1) and hopefully the findings will enable the prevention of further declines in the future.

Flatback tortoise,Burmese starred tortoise ,Animalia,Chordata,Reptilia,Testudines,Testudinidae,Geochelone (1),Carapace length: 26 cm (2),Like many turtles and tortoises of Southeast Asia the Burmese star tortoise has undergone dramatic declines due to the increasing demand in the Asian market in which it is sold for its meat and perceived medicinal value (9). Although \u2018subsistence\u2019 gathering of the species has occurred for hundreds of years by native people together with collection for its yellow-rayed <strong>carapace</strong> which is used for a container for cooking oil seeds etc. the impact was relatively small and sustainable. In recent years however subsistence has been replaced by mass commercial harvesting as the price of this species skyrocketed in the Asian markets (primarily Taiwan and China) (8). The tortoise has also been hard hit recently by the illegal international pet trade often ending up in European and North American collections (9). With their distinctive markings and dramatic colours these tortoises are attractive to collectors and their rarity makes them particularly valuable (10). Indeed adults can fetch up to US$7000 each from private collectors in the Western world (10) and this high price and demand encourages overexploitation of wild populations (5). Habitat destruction and wild fires also pose a threat to these tortoises particularly to smaller individuals (5).,The Burmese star tortoise exists in two protected areas Shwe Settaw Wildlife Sanctuary and Minzontaung Wildlife Sanctuary and an area proposed for protected status Myaleik Taung. At the Minzontaung Wildlife Sanctuary and Myaleik Taung the species is protected by local religious beliefs that deem it bad luck to collect the tortoises and commercial poaching is so far virtually non-existent. The Sanctuary is also well patrolled by guards with access strictly controlled and wild fires are managed. The Minzontaung Wildlife Sanctuary and Myaleik Taung therefore offer excellent potential for the successful conservation of the Burmese star tortoise (5). Sadly the Shwe Settaw Wildlife Sanctuary does not seem to be faring so well which has recently been reduced by around 30% due to the sale of a large tract to an agricultural development consortium. Subsistence and commercial harvest from the Sanctuary is commonplace with one village trader admitting to collecting 300 individuals in 6 months and there being at least one trader in every village. The Burmese star tortoise is fully protected by law and it is a capital offence to remove them from the wild. However the Myanmar Government reportedly ignore the capture and sale of these tortoises or are easily bribed with rampant civil war and radical guerrilla soldiers near the borders deterring police involvement there. A captive breeding programme has been set up at the Shwe Settaw Wildlife Sanctuary but hybridisation with <i>Indotestudo elongata</i> in a shared fenced area has been common. There is also evidence that this area is quickly grazed and tortoises here starve to death at an alarming rate. Stricter enforcement of protection laws is desperately needed and more effective management protocols at this Sanctuary but as long as a lucrative market exists tortoise hunting is likely to remain an attractive economic option for rural people (8). One suggestion has been to promote the significance of rural religious beliefs for the benefit of tortoise conservation in this area which has helped protect this beautiful species so effectively in the Minzontaung Wildlife Sanctuary and Myaleik Taung (5). However in a financially depressed society such as this the economic lure of such profitable natural resources may sadly win out (8).

Café Marron,Café marron ,Plantae,Tracheophyta,Magnoliopsida,Rubiales,Rubiaceae,Ramosmania (1),Height: 2 - 4 m (2),Along with much of Rodrigues\u2019 native vegetation it was probably a combination of introduced herbivores invasive alien plants and habitat loss that decimated the caf\xe9 marron population (6). Indeed goats had reduced the remaining wild specimen to a small half-eaten shrub when it was first discovered. Owing to the unprecedented level of scientific interest that surrounded the little plant in the aftermath of its re-discovery local people became convinced of the plant\u2019s medicinal properties (2). Consequently there was a period before the erection of multiple fences (1) (2) and even the installation of a guard when people were intent on removing branches twigs and leaves from the hapless plant (7). Although the protection of the single wild specimen has now been secured the real obstacle to the species\u2019 long-term survival is establishing an efficient means of propagating a non-sterile population from an effectively sterile plant (2).,Relatively soon after the re-discovery of the caf\xe9 marron cuttings from the surviving plant were sent to Kew Gardens in England. At Kew scientists were successful in propagating clones of the plant from the cuttings but could not find a means of successfully fertilising the flowers in order to produce seeds (2). Then in 2003 a major breakthrough was made when researchers discovered a technique to bypass the plant\u2019s self-incompatibility mechanism resulting in the production of a small number of viable seeds (2) (8). Since then several seeds have been successfully germinated at a nursery on Rodrigues with the aim of eventually re-vitalising a wild population on the island (9).

Although there are limits to how many groupers can be taken in each fishing trip the sheer number of fishermen (there are one million recreational licenses in Florida alone) has caused the population to continue to decline (1). As shallow water fish stocks decrease fishing is taking place in increasingly deep water in order to improve catch rates increasing the threat to the calico grouper (1).,In the eastern part of its range only one calico grouper may be taken per vessel per trip for both recreational and commercial boats; if more are taken these may not be traded or sold at sea (5). Limits for recreational and commercial boats also exist in the Gulf of Mexico (7) but unfortunately these regulations do nothing to prevent <strong>bycatch</strong> mortality.

Cóndor Californiano, Cóndor de California,California condor ,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Falconiformes,Cathartidae,Gymnogyps (1),9 kg (2),The original decline of the California condor followed the extinction of many large mammals in North America (5). Despite legal protection since 1900 (10) the 20th Century decline was due to human induced pressures such as trapping shooting egg collecting and lead poisoning following ingestion of carcasses killed with lead shot (2). Unfortunately lead poisoning still occurs regularly and remains the condor's greatest threat; other current threats include collisions with power lines shooting and both deliberate and accidental poisoning (12).,Towards the end of the 1980s with only eight individuals left in the wild it was clear that the extinction of this bird was imminent. The remaining wild individuals were taken into captivity and incorporated into an intensive conservation breeding programme run by San Diego Wild Animal Park Los Angeles Zoo and The Peregrine Fund (13). A variety of techniques were used in the breeding programme including <strong>double-clutching</strong> and the rearing of chicks with hand puppets and in 1992 the first condors were released back into the wild (14). Numerous hurdles have had to be overcome not least teaching captive birds to avoid power cables but in the spring of 2002 the first wild condor chick for two decades hatched (13). The rescue of the Californian condor is an ongoing conservation programme but the successes so far have been inspiring and the population continues to climb (8); today the condor can once again be seen soaring over the rocky Californian landscape.

Animalia,Cape stag beetle ,Animalia,Arthropoda,Insecta,Coleoptera,Lucanidae,Colophon (1),,Collectors appear to pose the greatest threat to this enigmatic group of beetles (4) (6). The Cape stag beetles are amongst the most highly prized beetles on the market (7) with complete sets of <i>Colophon</i> species fetching upward of $10000 and even single specimens of the rarest species being advertised at several thousand dollars (3). Four Germans have recently been caught having captured 211 of these beetles (5). Other threats include habitat damage and loss infrastructure development (such as mobile telephone masts) inappropriate fire regimes human disturbance climate change and over-collection by researchers (4). These threats are exacerbated by the small range occupied by this genus and their suspected low reproductive rate (4).,All <i>Colophon</i> species were given provincial legal protection in 1992 which served to limit legal collection internal trade and export from the province (7) (3). Their listing on Appendix III of CITES also controls import and export of the species across South Africa\u2019s borders (2). These laws appear to be fairly rigorously enforced with the four Germans recently caught with over 200 of these rare beetles fined almost \xa310000 (5). In 1994 it was proposed that <i>Colophon</i> beetles be upgraded to Appendix I of CITES but the proposal was ultimately withdrawn (7). The upgrade of <i>Colophon</i> beetles to Appendix I would certainly help their chances of future survival and should be seriously considered in the ongoing objective to protect these rare <strong>endemic</strong> beetles.

Callicebus moloch,Caquetá titi monkey ,Animalia,Chordata,Mammalia,Primates,Pitheciidae,Callicebus (1),Callicebus (1),With a total confirmed population of probably no more than 250 individuals the Caquet\xe1 titi monkey is clinging to a precarious existence. With so few individuals remaining extinction could be imminent for this enigmatic primate especially as its habitat is highly fragmented by agricultural land. To move between forest patches the Caquet\xe1 titi monkey must cross areas of grassland intersected by barbed wire fences limiting the species\u2019 natural movement across the landscape and making it highly vulnerable to predation and hunting. Furthermore as none of the species\u2019 known range occurs in protected areas it is likely that its already reduced habitat will continue to dwindle unless major conservation measures are implemented (2). \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0,Colombia supports a number of rare primates including several <strong>endemic</strong> species yet despite its critical importance for primate conservation there is still relatively little known about many of these species. Habitat loss is the single most important threat to Colombia\u2019s primates and even in protected areas where law enforcement is often inadequate deforestation is increasing (5). To prevent the <strong>endemic</strong> Caquet\xe1 titi monkey from becoming extinct efforts to publicise its presence are urgently needed and measures must to be taken to afford its remaining habitat greater protection. Further surveys are also required to determine the population size range and status of this extremely rare primate (2).

Plantae,Carossier palm ,Plantae,Tracheophyta,Liliopsida,Arecales,Palmae,Attalea (1),Hieght: up to 20 m (2),The conversion of habitat for agriculture has had a severe impact on <em>A. crassispatha</em> with slash and burn practices being especially unfavourable to natural regeneration (3) (4). In 1996 there were estimated to be less than 30 individuals remaining in the wild (1) (4) (5). Grazing by livestock on fruits and seedlings and a reduction in the abundance of seed dispersal agents is now limiting its ability to recover. Furthermore local people commonly harvest the immature seeds for food and cooking oil and the durable and insect resistant trunks are occasionally used in construction (3) (4) (5). Given the small size of its population <em>A. crassispatha</em> is also vulnerable to extreme natural events such as hurricanes (4) (5).,Conservation efforts for <em>A. crassispatha</em> have largely concentrated on planting palms and collecting seeds from adult plants in the wild (4). Probably the largest collection of the species is maintained at Fairchild Tropical Botanic Garden Miami Florida USA. However most of the palms in the collection are still too young to flower or fruit and of the few reproductively mature plants none have produced viable seed. As a result further research is needed to determine the possible causes of reproductive failure (5). During the 1990s numerous seedlings of <em>A. crassispatha</em> were also planted on the grounds of public buildings and private residences in Haiti in an effort to develop in-country <em>ex-situ</em> collections (4) (5). Unfortunately an assessment of the status of these seedlings is long overdue.

Plantae,Catalina mahogany ,Plantae,Tracheophyta,Magnoliopsida,Rosales,Rosaceae,Cercocarpus (1),Height: 3 - 7 m (2)Trunk diameter: c. 20 cm (2),Historically a major threat to the Catalina mahogany was the introduction of <strong>herbivores</strong> such as goats deer and pigs to Santa Catalina Island. Goats and deer ate the seedling shoots and the leaves of the tree while pigs rooting through the ground destroyed seedlings and the roots (6).,Conservation efforts began in the 1970s with a detailed inventory of the remaining Catalina mahogany plants (8). In 1999 the entire Wild Boar Gully area was fenced off enclosing 45 hectares (4). This action was successful and resulted in the numbers of seedlings and saplings increasing year after year reaching a peak of 113 individuals in 2002. However it is not known what portion of these seedlings and saplings are the Catalina mahogany and which are <strong>hybrids</strong> (6).

Animalia,Cave catfish ,Animalia,Chordata,Actinopterygii,Siluriformes,Clariidae,Clarias (1),Length: 16.1 cm (2),The cave catfish is found only within a single cave in Namibia and is therefore at inherent risk of extinction due to any chance event. The main threat to the species comes from the depletion of ground water within the cave and the exploitation of aquifer water may pose the most serious threat in the long-term (3).,The protection of the Aigamas Cave is vital in the conservation of this species and the present owner is sympathetic to the sensitivity of the cave only allowing access or collection of the cave catfish with a Nature Conservation Permit (3). Twenty captive specimens were held in the National Zoological Gardens' aquarium in Pretoria for several years (3) but no longer persist (7). There is also a move to provide legislative protection for this rare and unique fish (3).

four-coloured flowerpecker, orange-backed flowerpecker,Cebu flowerpecker ,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Dicaeidae,Dicaeum (1),Length: 11 - 12 cm (2),The island of Cebu has long been notorious for its deforestation\xa0(6). The native forests of the island were rapidly cleared as far back as the 1890s and a century later barely 0.03 percent or 15 square kilometres of the original forest cover remained\xa0(2). The rediscovery of the Cebu flowerpecker was unexpected because of the almost total loss of its habitat but what tiny forest patches do remain are still under threat from illegal settlement and logging road construction shifting cultivation firewood collection charcoal making and clearance for mining. In addition competition with the red-striped flowerpecker (<em>Dicaeum australe</em>) may have exacerbated the species\u2019 decline. With a population estimated at only around 100 individuals (as of 2009) and with a highly fragmented range totalling just 8 square kilometres the future of this small bird is highly uncertain\xa0(2)\xa0(3)\xa0(4) (7).,The Cebu flowerpecker has been the focus of a number of conservation efforts since its rediscovery. In 2009 it was chosen as the flagship species for the British Birdwatching Fair the largest fair of its kind in the world and the Philippines Department of Tourism has also pledged support for the species including financial support for conservation efforts by the Cebu Biodiversity Conservation Foundation\xa0(5) (8). Conservation actions for the species have so far included habitat rehabilitation attempts to control timber poaching and forest clearance the planting of corridors to link remaining forest patches and research into the flowerpecker\u2019s ecology. One site where the Cebu flowerpecker occurs the Nug-as Forest is managed and protected and local forest wardens regularly patrol both this and Dalaguete forest patches. A further site that may hold the species Malabuyoc is within the borders of a cement company reserve while another Mt. Lantoy has been declared a Watershed Forest Reserve\xa0(2)\xa0(4). The site of the Cebu flowerpecker\u2019s rediscovery at Tabunan has also been the subject of a project to support the protection and recovery of the forest and to promote the sustainable use of its resources\xa0(6) (9).

It is difficult to assess whether the population merely undergoes dramatic fluctuations in response to climate change or if other factors are also to blame for past population crashes (2). Some potential threats however include the loss of habitat through inappropriate fire management or grazing by feral herbivores such as horses (2). Predation by dingoes may also be a factor that threatens the survival of this species (2).,The majority of sites where the central rock-rat is known to exist are found within the West MacDonnell National Park (2). Captive individuals are being reared in Alice Springs Desert Park (4) and a management plan for wild populations is in the final stages of production (2).

Chatham shag,Chatham Island shag ,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Pelecaniformes,Phalacrocoracidae,Phalacrocorax (1),Length: 63 cm (2),It is not clear why the Chatham Island shag population is declining so rapidly but it has been noted with interest and concern that the largest and most successful breeding <strong>colonies</strong> of this sea bird are found in areas that are not disturbed by the various introduced species living on the Chatham Islands. The <strong>colonies</strong> of Chatham Island itself are plagued by humans cattle pigs sheep cats dogs weka (<i>Gallirallus australis</i>) and brush-tailed possums (<i>Trichosurus vulpecula</i>). Disturbance is thought to cause the birds to trample on their nests; breaking the eggs before abandoning the site. Breeding sites have also been abandoned following the arrival of the fur seal (<i>Arctocephalus forsteri</i>) on Star Keys Island. Small numbers of birds are shot or caught in crayfish pots and it is thought that changes in the marine environment may have affected the availability of fish species (2).,A census of the Chatham Island shag was taken in 1997 and a follow-up was done in 2003-2004 as part of the Chatham Island Shag and Pitt Island Shag Recovery Plan that was brought into effect in 2001. It recommends that the population as a whole is surveyed every five years but that a closer eye is kept on the colonies of Chatham Island with a census each year. Authorities are hoping to come to an agreement with local land and stock owners that would enable fences to be built around breeding <strong>colonies</strong>. Dog owners need to be educated as to the effect their pets can have on the Chatham Island shag and eco-tourists must be similarly supervised. It may be necessary to gain legal protection for all colonies (2).

Animalia,Cherry-throated tanager ,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Thraupidae,Nemosia (1),Head-body length: c. 14 cm (2),Human settlers began clearing Brazil\u2019s Atlantic forests in the 16<sup>th</sup>century when European explorers established along the coastline. Forests were initially cut down for timber and later to make room for the rapidly expanding cattle ranches and sugar plantations. The rate of deforestation increased dramatically in the 19<sup>th</sup>and 20<sup>th</sup>centuries due to rapid population and economic growth and an increased demand for charcoal and firewood. The legacy of such a destructive history is that tragically today less than 10 percent of the Atlantic forest remains. Consequently many of the species within this region are seriously threatened with extinction (6) (7). One such species the cherry-throated tanager now has a critically small population probably no more than 250 individuals and a very patchy distribution (2). The future of this rare species is threatened by further loss to what little habitat remains through urban and agricultural encroachment and timber extraction (4) (8).,The survival of the Critically Endangered cherry-throated tanager is perilously bound to the future management of two privately owned forests in which the last remaining populations are found (2) (3) (4). Thankfully however since 2004 SAVE Brasil has been working with the government and local organisations and communities to ensure the conservation of the forests on which the cherry-throated tanager depends to survive. As a result of these efforts in June 2010 the government of the state of Esp\xedrito Santo created ten Ecological Corridors including the Cherry-throated Tanager Corridor which are recognised as\xa0crucial areas for the state\u2019s biodiversity. These areas are to be prioritised for future conservation work with plans to reconnect remnant forest patches through <strong>afforestation</strong> and restoration work and the promotion of sustainable activities and soil management (9).

Animalia,Chile Darwin’s frog ,Animalia,Chordata,Amphibia,Anura,Cycloramphidae,Rhinoderma (1),Male snout-vent length: 31 mm (2)Female snout-vent length: 33 mm (2),The causes of the Chile Darwin\u2019s frog precipitous decline and subsequent disappearance are not well understood. It is thought that habitat loss through the planting of plantations and residential development may have had some impact whilst climate change and possibly disease might have caused declines in existing areas of suitable habitat (1) (3).,Urgent survey work is vital to determine whether the Chile Darwin\u2019s frog still survives. In addition suitable habitat for this species needs to be surveyed to determine whether amphibian pathogens such as the chytrid fungus (not previously reported in Chile) are present in the area. Given the threat of disease it would likely be necessary to establish an <strong>ex-situ</strong> population if surviving individuals are ever discovered (1) (3).

Alligator De Chine,Chinese alligator ,Animalia,Chordata,Reptilia,Crocodylia,Alligatoridae,Alligator (1),up to 40 kg (2),A survey by the Wildlife Conservation Society in 1999 found the wild population of Chinese alligators to be worryingly low: at 130 to 150 individuals (2). Habitat destruction has been the major cause of this decline and wetland areas continue to be modified for agriculture in an effort to cope with the intense human population pressure in the region (4). A highly secretive species spending a long period of time (6 to 7 months) below ground in burrows the Chinese alligator now primarily exists in populated areas where it inevitably comes into conflict with local farmers. Burrow systems cause drainage problems for fields and alligators also consume ducks owned by farmers (2). Despite a lack of commercial value for the Chinese alligator's skin on the international market these reptiles are often killed when encountered either through fear or due to a threat to livelihood (2).,In contrast to the decimated wild population the breeding of captive Chinese alligators has been very successful and the captive population currently exceeds 10000 individuals (2). The Anhui Research Centre of Chinese Alligator Reproduction (ARCCAR) was established in 1979 and houses captive-bred alligators within 26 small protected reserves (2). Any wild populations that remain are severely fragmented and almost none exist in their natural habitat (2). However the Chinese government has recently allocated funds to create new habitats with a view to introduce captive-bred alligators into the wild in three other provinces (2). This encouraging step needs the support of local people to make it a success; they will need to be convinced of the worth of living together with this ancient species that may have been associated with the mythical Chinese dragon.

Chinese crested-tern, Chinese-crested tern, Matsu tern,Chinese crested tern ,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Charadriiformes,Laridae,Sterna (1),Length: 42 cm (2),The specific threats facing this exceptionally rare bird have not yet been identified but a range of environmental issues are known to affect other species within its range and are therefore highly plausible threats to the Chinese crested tern (4). Offshore islets which appear to be the key nesting areas of this species are thought to be relatively safe from human disturbance. However other coastal wetlands in the Chinese crested tern\u2019s presumed breeding range in eastern China have been affected by large-scale development projects (4) (6). Seabirds are also hunted and exploited for food in China. Indeed the main threat to the newly discovered population on the Mazu Dao islands is from fishermen from mainland China who visit the nesting islets to collect seashells and bird eggs. Other potential threats include the introduction of rats and cats to currently predator-free offshore islands oil pollution and contamination of estuarine areas by industrial and agricultural pollutants and human disturbance (6).,The Mazu Dao islands were declared as the National Matzu Nature Reserve for Terns in 2000 offering some protection to the birds there (4) (6). The most recent sighting of the Chinese crested tern in China was from Huanghe Sanjiaozhou Nature Reserve in Shandong in 1991 and several other protected areas exist along the Chinese coast where this species may occur (4). The Chinese crested tern is nationally protected in China and Thailand and the area where it was once recorded in Thailand is protected as the Laem Talumphuk Non-Hunting Area (4) (6). Further studies are certainly needed to better understand this species including its range what sort of breeding success it is having the exact threats it faces and its protection needs (7). One suggested measure which has been successful elsewhere is to give local people a vested interest in seeing the terns remain alive perhaps by allowing or encouraging fishermen to take birdwatchers to see the rare seabirds rather than collecting their eggs (7). Thus special boat trips have now been made available from Matsu Island to the National Matsu Nature Reserve for Terns during the months of June and July for NT$350 (approx. US$11). Landing on the nesting island is not permitted and viewing is from the boat at a safe distance so that the terns are not disturbed but this revenue may help protect the Chinese crested tern by making it more valuable alive than dead (5).

Chinese salamander,Chinese giant salamander ,Animalia,Chordata,Amphibia,Caudata,Cryptobranchidae,Andrias (1),Length: 1.8 m (2),The Chinese giant salamander is threatened by hunting as its flesh is considered a delicacy in Asia. Other threats include habitat alteration and loss; deforestation causes soil erosion and increased runoff and silting in rivers. The building of dams in China over the years has also changed the natural river flow in some areas where the Chinese giant salamander is found. Local pesticides fertilizers and pollutants are also thought to affect the health of this amphibian though little research has been conducted. Symptoms of these recent threats include the lower numbers of Chinese giant salamanders recorded with smaller populations and also smaller individuals (4).,The Chinese giant salamander is now protected from international trade by its listing on Appendix I of the Convention of International Trade of Endangered Species (CITES) (3). Since the 1980s 14 nature reserves with a total area of more than 355000 hectares have been established for the conservation of the Chinese giant salamander (7). This includes a huge 99975 hectare area of Mount Wuyi China which was designated as a World Heritage Site in 1999 dedicated to conserving this biodiverse region including the habitat of this salamander (8). The surrounding area has a growing population and the establishment of this reserve will protect many species. However there are still concerns that development around the reserve and tourism plans within the reserve will place pressure on Mount Wuyi\u2019s rich resources healthy rivers and habitats. Conservation efforts to protect this habitat and other areas where the ancient Chinese giant salamander is found are essential for the survival of this species and many others (8).

Pangolin À Queue Courte, Pangolin De Chine,Chinese pangolin ,Animalia,Chordata,Mammalia,Pholidota,Manidae,Manis (1),2 – 7 kg (2),Due to its solitary and <strong>nocturnal</strong> nature this species is rarely observed and therefore little information exists on its status; however the population is believed to be declining (1). The Chinese pangolin has been intensively hunted for its meat which is considered a delicacy as well as for its skin and scales which have been used to scratch mosquito bites due to their supposed antiseptic properties or ground into a powder which is believed to have aphrodisiac properties and an ability to cure for skin diseases (4) (6). Due to it being more terrestrial than other Asian pangolin species it has been easier to hunt and is now very rare in some countries of its range such as Vietnam and Lao PDR (1). Hunting is the main threat to the Chinese pangolin as disturbance of its habitat has not been shown to have a large impact provided its food source of termites and ants are not lost (1). \xa0,The Chinese pangolin is legally protected in the majority of countries it resides in including Bangladesh China Taiwan Thailand and India. It also occurs in some protected areas but unfortunately these measures have not been sufficient in reducing the illegal hunting and trade that takes place (1). While large seizures of illegally caught Chinese pangolins do occur greater enforcement of laws and improved management of protected areas are required to prevent this devastating hunting (1).

Asian three-striped box turtle, golden coin turtle,Chinese three-striped box turtle ,Animalia,Chordata,Reptilia,Testudines,Bataguridae,Cuora (1),Carapace length: up to 20 cm (2),Turtles and tortoises across Southeast Asia have undergone massive declines in recent years due to overexploitation for the Southern Asian particularly Chinese food markets (9). Although having been hunted by local people for subsistence for centuries recent changes in Asian economics have opened up direct access to foreign markets in which turtles and tortoises are favoured for their meat and perceived medicinal value (10). The Chinese three-striped box turtle has suffered particularly badly because of recent claims that its <strong>plastron</strong> contains medicinal properties that can cure cancer which has driven up the demand and therefore price bringing this species to the edge of extinction (2). Additionally this rare turtle is highly sought after by the pet trade with adults fetching up to US$3000 each (6) (9). Such a high market value inevitably leads to over-collection from the wild. Indeed some Chinese can attain enough money to build a house from the sale of a single adult Chinese three-striped box turtle an extremely powerful incentive (6).,In 2001 a programme on the conservation of wild fauna and flora and the establishment of nature reserves was begun in China. Many new nature reserves have been created some of which offer habitat for tortoises and freshwater turtles (11). This species is protected by law in Hong Kong under the Wild Animals Protection Ordinance Cap. 170. under which collection of any wild turtles is prohibited unless under a special permit obtained from the Agricultural Fisheries and Conservation Department (7). Individuals employed by the Agricultural Fisheries and Conservation Department of Hong Kong also patrol protected territories to curb illegal hunting of native tortoises and freshwater turtles (11). Various captive breeding programmes for this species exist around the world (12) but this Department is also implementing a captive breeding project with a local conservation organisation that includes plans for subsequent reintroductions into the wild (11).

Andrew's or Christmas Island frigatebird,Christmas frigatebird ,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Pelecaniformes,Fregatidae,Fregata (1),Length: 89 - 100 cm (2),Habitat destruction and human predation have been the major causes of population decline in the past (6); dust pollution from phosphate mine driers caused one major nesting site to be abandoned (4). Dust suppression equipment has since been installed and human predation has ceased since this species has been protected (4). Birds that have been displaced in the past may now be using sub-optimal habitat which could pose a threat to their survival (4). The Christmas frigatebird is confined to a few breeding <strong>colonies</strong> on a single island and this together with their low reproductive rate (4) makes the population alarmingly vulnerable to any chance event.,Christmas Island National Park was established in 1989 and contains two of the three current breeding populations of this species\xa0(5). Christmas frigatebirds are also protected outside of the park and by Migratory Bird Agreements between Australia and other countries (4). This species remains highly vulnerable however and the close monitoring of breeding success and population size remains a high priority (4).

Plantae,Clanwilliam cedar ,Plantae,Tracheophyta,Coniferopsida,Coniferales,Cupressaceae,Widdringtonia (1),Height: up to 25 metres (3),At the time of European settlement of South Africa the Clanwilliam cedar became massively logged in order to produce furniture telegraph poles and other structures (8). Vast tracts of the ancient forest have been lost. Today high-intensity fires represent the biggest threat to survival and groves of dead sliver trees ravaged by fire stand out starkly against the landscape (6). In early 2002 large bush fires destroyed around 200 hectares of a cedar plantation (8).,Logging of the Clanwilliam cedar was banned at the turn of the 20th Century but under various pressures such as fire the population has not shown any signs of recovery (6). A concerted conservation programme to save this ancient giant is now in place and a 5252-hectare area has been set aside as a Cedar Reserve (6). Within the reserve fires are managed and controlled in order to prevent high-intensity summer fires from sweeping through the area. Seedlings are also grown in order to be replanted and thus help the struggling population to recover. It is hoped that focussing on such a charismatic species will also benefit other members of this unique South African habitat (6).

These fish are accidentally caught on lines whilst local fisherman search the deep waters for other species (6). Due to the likely slow reproduction rate and small number of offspring of coelacanths the species is possibly particularly vulnerable to the removal of pregnant females from the population (6).,The coelacanth is protected from international trade by its listing on Appendix I of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) (1). Fishermen of the Grand Comoro Island have also imposed a voluntary ban on fishing in areas where coelacanths (or \u2018gombessa\u2019 as they are known locally) exist (5) in a vital effort to save their country\u2019s most unique fauna. The Coelacanth Rescue Mission is also distributing Deep Release Kits to local fishermen which provide an effective method of returning accidentally caught fish to their deep habitat (3). There have recently been encouraging signs that the Comoros population is now stable (5) although careful monitoring will be needed to ensure this living fossil survives into the next millennium.

Plantae,Cook's holly ,Plantae,Tracheophyta,Magnoliopsida,Celastrales,Aquifoliaceae,Ilex (1),Max height: 2-3 m (2),Having last been reviewed on the IUCN Red List in 1998 the conservation status of Cook\u2019s holly is in urgent need of updating (1). The construction of communication towers on Cerro de Punta is thought to have destroyed a large part of the original population with further development and construction activities being cited as the main threat to the remaining plants (1) (3). The highly restricted range of Cook\u2019s holly also makes it extremely vulnerable to natural disturbances such as landslides and hurricanes (2).,Cook\u2019s holly was listed on the US Endangered Species Act in 1987 and a Recovery Plan was drawn up by the US Fish and Wildlife Service in 1991 (1) (2). Several necessary actions were outlined in the plan including: the protection and monitoring of existing populations; the undertaking of research into the species\u2019 life history and reproductive biology; and the propagation of seedlings for the enhancement of existing populations and the establishment of new ones (2). However since none of these measures appear to have been implemented thus far (5) an up-to-date evaluation of the condition of the remaining plants seems to be seriously overdue.

Animalia,Corroboree frog ,Animalia,Chordata,Amphibia,Anura,Myobatrachidae,Pseudophryne (1),Length: 2.5 - 3 cm (2),There has been a recent decline in this previously abundant species which has now been lost from as much as 68% of its former range (5). The unusual life cycle of the corroboree frog makes it particularly vulnerable; only one small clutch is laid in a year and tadpoles have a long development time (4). The precise causes of this sudden decline are unclear but a number of factors may be involved including habitat destruction by ski resort development and trampling by humans and livestock (6). However it is now widely accepted that chytrid fungus is a major (if not the primary) cause of their continuous decline (9).,A Recovery Plan for the corroboree frog has been published by the National Parks and Wildlife Service of New South Wales (5). This plan identifies the urgent need for more population data and investigation into the cause of the continuing decline in numbers. Research into captive breeding techniques will also be undertaken (5). In the short term the plan aims to halt the precipitous decline of this species and then work to restore this colourful frog to much of its former range (5).

cotton-top tamarin, crested tamarin,Cotton-headed tamarin ,Animalia,Chordata,Mammalia,Primates,Callitrichidae,Saguinus (1),300 - 450 g (2),Deforestation is this species\u2019 greatest threat (6). It has already lost most of its habitat through forest clearing for timber charcoal human settlement agricultural land and industry (3). The forest areas in which it now exists are so fragmented it is believed that they are too small to maintain the tamarin populations (3). Sadly the continuous expansion of human settlement in northern Colombia has brought the cotton-headed tamarin more bad luck. With easier access to the tamarin\u2019s habitat animal collectors trap these small monkeys and sell them in port cities either for export or local trade (10). Populations in the past have also suffered from the export of significant numbers for biomedical research in the 1960s and 1970s (5) (9).,The cotton-headed tamarin has been\xa0protected in Colombia since 1969 and export of this species has been banned since 1974 (1).\xa0However its numbers have continued to dwindle away as has its habitat and hope of survival. If this species is to survive it is essential that immediate conservation measures are implemented (3) (8).

Animalia,Cozumel thrasher ,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Mimidae,Toxostoma (1),49 – 60 g (2),Once thought to be a common bird on Cozumel Island the Cozumel thrasher suffered significant declines after hurricane Gilbert tore through the island in 1988 and only three individuals were found in the following seven years. After another hurricane in 1995 no thrashers were found in annual surveys until an individual was discovered in 2004 (2). The devastating effect of hurricanes remains a primary threat to any remaining small population. However it is believed other threats must have contributed to the decline of this species as it is likely to have survived hurricanes for millions of years. Introduced predators especially boas which were released onto the island in 1971 may have had a significant impact on Cozumel thrashers (4). Whilst large areas of forest remain on Cozumel Island the ubiquitous threat of human development and associated habitat loss and degradation is likely to increase pressures on this critically endangered species (3) (4).,Research is currently underway on the Cozumel thrasher in a project funded by the American Bird Conservancy and Conservation International (4). Surveys are urgently needed to determine whether this species still persists and an investigation into its ecology would provide further explanation for its decline and help identify suitable conservation actions (2) (5). The Cozumel thrasher is at great risk of imminent extinction but hopefully there is still the chance to pull it back from the brink.

Its habitat is also threatened by human settlement land clearing for agriculture and logging. While this is a problem in many areas worldwide Sulawesi is particularly sensitive as it is an island and therefore has a limited amount of land for its wildlife and expanding human population (4).,International trade in this species is prohibited by its listing on Appendix II of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) (3). Hunting on the island however is harder to regulate. This macaque is found in three areas on the island where hunting logging and clearing is illegal. However it is not clear how effective these regulations are (4). Captive breeding of this species has been successful at Jersey Zoo and a number of other zoos and individuals may be reintroduced into the wild in the future. If this species is to survive it is essential to address the problems of hunting and habitat loss on Sulawesi (5).

Animalia,Cromwell chafer ,Animalia,Arthropoda,Insecta,Coleoptera,Scarabaeidae,Prodontria (1),Length: 15 - 16 mm (2)Width: 8.5 mm (2),The original range of the Cromwell chafer was around 500 hectares but this was reduced to just 100 hectares following the construction of the Clyde Dam and the expansion of the township of Cromwell (4).  Threats facing this species are not fully understood but are thought to include predation by introduced hedgehogs (<i>Erinaceus europaeus</i>). The little owl (<i>Athene noctua</i>) is also known to predate upon this species (3). Habitat alteration is also likely to be a problem (2). At the present time large areas of apparently suitable habitat are not occupied by this beetle. It is imperative that the reasons for its present distribution and the factors limiting the population are understood (3).,The site supporting this species has been fully protected since it became a nature reserve in 1983. Research and monitoring of the Cromwell chafer populations are on-going and current work is focusing on the predation risk posed by hedgehogs and other predators potential competitors and understanding the life history of the species (3). Hopes are that the knowledge gained from these studies will help to develop and guide the effective conservation of this unique and very rare beetle.

Crocodile De Cuba,Cuban crocodile ,Animalia,Chordata,Reptilia,Crocodylia,Crocodylidae,Crocodylus (1),130 kg (2),The Cuban crocodile is highly vulnerable due to the restricted nature of its distribution (5). Habitat destruction continues to encroach on the marshes where this species is found and competition with introduced and <strong>hybrid</strong> species poses further threats to survival (5).,Recent reports indicated that population numbers of the Cuban crocodile are showing signs of recovery; the population in the Zapata swamp is estimated at between 3000 and 6000 individuals (6). Active measures are underway to ensure this population remains well protected but a further important conservation priority is the establishment of an alternative wild population (5). In the 1950s to 60s thousands of Cuban crocodiles were taken into captivity to be farmed for their skins and the population of captive animals is today substantial one farm has recently been given CITES (Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species) approval to trade internationally (6).

Cumberland bean, Purple bean,Cumberland bean pearly mussel ,Animalia,Mollusca,Bivalvia,Unionoida,Unionidae,Villosa (1),Length: up to 5.5 cm (2),Historically the Cumberland bean pearly mussel inhabited ten river systems but now occupies only four (3). Unfortunately like many other species of mussel the Cumberland bean pearly mussel is under threat due to human activities namely siltation channelization and water pollution such as from toxic chemical spills and run-off from urban and agricultural areas (8). Being a filter feeder the Cumberland bean pearly mussel must have exceptionally clean water to feed reproduce and respire thus any pollution or siltation seriously jeopardises the mussel\u2019s chance of survival as the water becomes dirty or poisonous. In addition channelization destroys suitable river habitats changing the dynamics of the water downstream so that it is no longer suitable for the mussel (2). Population numbers are hard to estimate as little data are available; however it is thought that there are around 1000 to 2000 individuals left in the wild meaning that this species has suffered a decline of around 75 to 90 percent since it was first discovered (4).,This species was first listed as Endangered by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service in June 1976 and a conservation plan was approved in August 1984. The aims of the recovery plan are to re-establish the Cumberland bean pearly mussel within two river systems that were formerly part of its range and to prevent the loss or degradation of existing habitats (4) (8). It is essential for more research to be carried out on the life history of this mysterious mussel including studies to identify the host fish species of the <strong>larvae</strong> to understand how to rear the species in a laboratory to aid with reintroduction and to identify potential habitats for reintroduction (4).

Although its modern scarcity is at least partly attributable to habitat loss and the unscrupulous activities of collectors this species is thought to have already been naturally rare long before humans had a significant impact on its environment (2) (4) (5).,Although E. latifrons is scarce in the wild numerous specimens are known to occur in public and private collections (4). Fortunately owing to its listing on Appendix I of CITES all trade in this species is prohibited unless under exceptional circumstances (3). In an effort to increase the number of individuals occurring in the wild a propagation project is being developed with the cooperation of commercial farmers in the Eastern Cape province of South Africa. The aim is to set up a seed nursery for E. latifrons using seed collected from wild pants that have been artificially pollinated (4).

The development of this new power station will almost certainly result in the elevation of this cycad\u2019s Red List status as a large proportion of the population will be wiped out\xa0(4). The activities of local communities pose an additional threat with seasonal fires and deliberate felling being particularly problematic (10).,<em>Encephalartos whitelockii </em>is partially protected by its listing on Appendix I of CITES which permits international trade in this species only under exceptional circumstances (3). In addition part of the <em>E. whitelockii</em> population occurs within the boundary of the Queen Elizabeth National Park although the integrity of some of Uganda\u2019 protected areas is a moot point\xa0(4). Owing to the increased pressure on <em>E. whitelockii</em> a local community-based conservation project is fortunately being implemented in the region. The project is aiming to raise community awareness on the conservation and importance of the species as well as to create a seed bank and nursery. The propagation of <em>E. whitelockii</em> in a nursery will provide plants for replanting in the wild to bolster the population\xa0(10). With the population under as serious threat as it is projects like this may be critical to this species survival.

The livestock not only cause drier land but also drive the gazelle away. Civil unrest in several of the countries home to this once numerous gazelle has also contributed to its decline (12).,The range of the dama gazelle falls on some of the poorest countries in Africa and consequently little action is being taken to conserve this species. It is managed in captivity and exists in a few reserves in its range but they are not well guarded and offer little more protection than any other area (14).

Pseudalopex griseus fulvipes,Darwin’s fox ,Animalia,Chordata,Mammalia,Carnivora,Canidae,Pseudalopex (1),1.9 – 3.95 kg (2),Darwin\u2019s fox is considered critically endangered being highly vulnerable to extinction due to its small numbers and very restricted range having just two known populations (4). The greatest threat to this species\u2019 survival on the mainland is probably the presence of unleashed dogs in Nahuelbuta National Park which may attack the foxes and also have the potential to transmit diseases. Despite dogs being prohibited from the park they are often allowed in with visitors and subsequently let loose (1). Many foxes have become habituated to humans through unrestricted feeding by visitors and spend much of their time under vehicles in the car park where they are at risk of being killed by visitors\u2019 cars (2). The larger island population appears relatively safer with Chilo\xe9 National Park encompassing most of the still untouched rainforest of the island and containing a sizeable fox population. However surrounding areas also containing foxes are suffering from ongoing logging forest fragmentation and poaching by locals (1). Some foxes have been persecuted by farmers on the island for killing their poultry and attacks from dogs also pose a threat here (2).,Darwin\u2019s fox has been protected by Chilean law since 1929 but enforcement can be difficult and some poaching unfortunately continues (1). Research and monitoring of this species is ongoing being undertaken by initiatives such as Darwin\u2019s Fox Research and Conservation Project which also seeks to raise awareness amongst schools dog owners farmers and loggers of the plight of the fox and the dangers that imperil it (5). The 430 square kilometre Chilo\xe9 National Park protects much of the island population and the smaller 68 square kilometre Nahuelbuta National Park protects the mainland population. However a number of foxes at Nahuelbuta are known to move to lower unprotected areas during the winter in search of milder conditions where they become more vulnerable to mortality. It has therefore been recommended that the park be expanded to protect the foxes that use these areas (1). However it is also essential that Park wardens become stricter about enforcing Park rules. Dogs brought in by visitors pose a serious threat whilst continuous feeding of the foxes has habituated them to humans and thereby made them ever more vulnerable to the dangers people bring. Indeed it has been suggested that if current relaxed attitudes continue in Nahuelbuta National Park Chilo\xe9 National Park may become the only long-term safe area for this rare <strong>endemic</strong> fox (2).

One small population is likely to be lost within the next 25 years as mining activity is planned in part of Sainte Luce while many other populations are under continual threat from local communities exploiting the forest\u2019s resources (1). Indeed the day gecko is suspected to have become extinct in Petriky Forest due to tree felling for timber fuel and conversion to agricultural land (2). This highly specialised species is also threatened by the selective removal of <em>Pandus</em> trees (1).\xa0,The Ambatotsirongorongo Forest which supports a large proportion of the remaining day gecko population is encompassed by a newly created protected area. Five forest fragments at Sainte Luce in which the day gecko is also found are also managed within a community resource use agreement which aims to protect the local people\u2019s livelihoods whilst conserving biodiversity (1). However the successful management of these areas will very much depend on the support of the local people and the abandonment of destructive activities such as slash-and-burn agriculture and hunting (7). Fortunately for the day gecko <em>Phelsuma </em>\xa0species breed well in captivity and the initiation of a captive-breeding programme for this gecko may well safeguard it from extinction (2).\xa0

white-rumped black langur,Delacour’s langur ,Animalia,Chordata,Mammalia,Primates,Cercopithecidae,Trachypithecus (1),Male head-to-body length: 57 – 62 cm (2)Female head-to-body length: 57 – 59 cm (2)Mail tail length: 82 - 88 cm (2)Female tail length: 84 – 86 cm (2)Male weight: 7.5 – 10.5 kg (2)Female weight: 6.2 – 9.2 kg (2),With as few as 270 to 300 estimated individuals remaining in 19 isolated populations and 14 of these populations predicted to disappear in the next decade Delacour\u2019s langur is dangerously close to extinction (1) (8). During the 1990s when Vietnam opened itself up to the international community and the Chinese economy started to boom traders and poachers moved in to utilise Vietnam\u2019s biodiversity (4). Poachers killed this langur not only for meat but also for bones organs and tissues that are used in traditional medicines (8). Hunting has reduced in recent years with increasing legal protection but continues to pose a significant threat. Habitat loss is also a danger to this species with the World Conservation Monitoring Centre of the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP-WCMC) estimating that a total of 30000 hectares of forest are destroyed each year in Vietnam (4). The clearing of forests to accommodate human commercial and residential growth continues to separate the remaining populations of Delacour\u2019s langur which are now at risk of becoming too small to be viably sustainable (2). Sixty percent of Delacour\u2019s langurs occur in isolated populations of fewer than 20 individuals. The loss of these sub-populations and consequently 60 percent of the whole population is feared likely in the near future without management strict regulations and law enforcement (5).,Four areas where Delacour\u2019s langurs are protected include: Cuc Phuong National Park Pu Luong Nature Reserve Hoa Lu Cultural and Historical Site and the recently-established Van Long Nature Reserve which is believed to contain the largest remaining population of around 70 individuals (5) (8). Unfortunately protected areas often suffer more from poaching than unprotected areas because their dense population of wildlife is seen as more profitable (2). Thus conservation groups are working to increase the level of protection and law enforcement within these protected areas. The Van Long Nature Reserve is now well guarded by rangers largely funded by the Frankfurt Zoological Society. The Pu Luong Nature Reserve also employs a large number of rangers which are helping to save the small remaining populations (8). These are encouraging steps towards helping the survival of Delacour\u2019s langur listed as one of the 25 most endangered primates in the world (8). Recent commitments by the Vietnamese government and several international conservation organisations to do more to protect Delacour\u2019s langur have greatly increased the chances of saving this rare and remarkable species (2).

Animalia,Delta green ground beetle ,Animalia,Arthropoda,Insecta,Coleoptera,Carabidae,Elaphrus (1),Length: 6 mm (2).,The historical distribution of the delta ground beetle is unknown but it is thought reasonable to assume that the species was once found throughout the wetlands and grasslands of California\u2019s Central Valley (4). The area has suffered widespread disruption and destruction of its wetland habitat from agricultural development tapping of vernal pools for irrigation of crops river channelisation and encroaching urban development all of which are thought to have played a role in the demise of this species (2) (4). Additionally an introduced alien plant garden lippia (<i>Phyla</i> spp.) poses an immediate threat to the species\u2019 remaining range. The plant forms dense mats in vernal pools crowding out native vegetation and hindering the beetle\u2019s foraging (2). Only around 75 individuals have been seen since 1974 and the species\u2019 small range places it in very serious danger of extinction (4).,The delta green ground beetle is protected by the Lacey Act which prohibits its import export transport sale purchase receipt or acquisition (4). The beetle is also protected through its occurrence in the Jepson Prairie Reserve (5) but other suitable sites nearby are on private land and negotiations over their protection are ongoing (2). Since its life cycle is intricately intertwined with the seasonal changes of its vernal pool habitat conservation of the delta green ground beetle very much depends upon the protection of this habitat which is itself endangered (2). Thus protection of this disappearing habitat must be the top priority in the conservation of not only the delta ground beetle but also the array of other endangered species that are unique to and depend heavily upon this threatened vernal pool ecosystem.

Plantae,Diospyros ,Plantae,Tracheophyta,Magnoliopsida,Ebenales,Ebenaceae,Diospyros (1),,<em>Diospyros veillonii</em> is restricted to just one tiny area of forest and its population has been estimated at only around 20 adult trees (1). The forest patch is privately owned and part of the <em>Diospyros veillonii</em> population has already been destroyed by a bulldozed trail as part of a construction project. Surveys in surrounding areas have failed to find this species in any other location (1).,New Caledonia is considered to be a global \u2018hotspot\u2019 of biodiversity (7). Around 75 percent of its plant species are found nowhere else (4) (7) (8) (9) and its dry forest habitat alone contains 59 <strong>endemic</strong> plants including <em>Diospyros veillonii</em> (9). As this species occurs on private land it conservation is entirely dependent on the land owner who has been informed of its presence and appears willing to take care of it (1).

Nevertheless the small and exposed nature of its home means that this rare and fascinating snail remains somewhat helpless to the changing world around it (1).

This not only allows the species to be studied in greater depth but also serves as a buffer against total extinction. Indeed it is feared that these relics of an earlier stage of evolution may disappear from the wild completely in less than a decade (6).

Animalia,Dwarf olive ibis ,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Ciconiiformes,Threskiornithidae,Bostrychia (1),Length: 60 – 65 cm (2),The historical clearance of much of Sao Tom\xe9\u2019s lowland forest for sugar cane and cocoa plantations undoubtedly had a catastrophic impact on the dwarf olive ibis\u2019s population (2) (5) (6). While today large-scale clearance for plantations has mostly stopped (2) (5) forest clearance for small farms continues and there is also the possibility that exploitation of <strong>primary forest</strong> for timber and firewood will increase dramatically in the future (5). In addition this species is severely affected by hunting and predation from introduced mammals such as the mona monkey (<i>Cercopithecus mona</i>) African civet (<i>Civettictis civetta</i>) and weasel (<i>Mustela nivalis</i>) (2). With its population estimated in 2007 to be between 50 and 249 individuals the combined effects of these threats are rapidly pushing the dwarf olive ibis towards extinction (2).,There are currently no conservation measures in place for the dwarf olive ibis. While various organisations have proposed that this species and its habitat should be given protected status this has yet to occur (2) (6). Without intervention this unique species found nowhere else in the world could disappear forever (2).

The biggest threats to Grauer\u2019s gorillas result from armed conflict in and around the parks. In the past decade many Grauer\u2019s gorillas have been shot dead in crossfire or for food by people hiding in the forest. Ongoing instability in the region means that this problem is getting worse as civil war has made arms more accessible and continues to create large numbers of refugees (7). A relatively new threat to the gorillas comes from the tourism. While tourism has so far aided its survival large numbers of people coming into close contact with gorillas may put them at risk from human diseases (7).,The mountain gorilla occurs mainly within national parks and in some areas is protected by armed guards to prevent poaching (7). Gorillas in the Virunga region have been studied and protected for many decades and are now seen as an important source of tourist revenue (8). The United Nations Environmental Programme (UNEP) has recognised the urgent need to protect our closest relatives and has established a Great Ape Survival Project (GRASP). This project is aimed at identifying the conservation initiatives required to secure the future of the apes and at obtaining political support and funding to allow these to be achieved (9). A multifaceted approach is needed to ensure the survival of one of our most impressive cousins.

Vietnam\u2019s lowland <strong>primary forest</strong> has now almost been completely stripped away as a result of herbicide spraying during the Vietnam War and more recently by commercial logging and clearance for agriculture (5) (6). The last remaining forests known to support this pheasant are becoming progressively degraded by wood-cutters (6) and are vulnerable to commercial logging firewood collection charcoal production and the continued clearance of land for cultivation (7). It is thought that the completion of the Ho Chi Minh National Highway which bisects the three provinces in which the species is known to occur will only serve to increase the levels of disturbance. Hunting for food poses an additional threat and this pheasant is likely to be affected by indiscriminate snaring (6).,The areas in which there are recent records for Edwards\u2019s pheasant have been incorporated into two recently established nature reserves Phong Dien and Dakrong which are likely to be the last refuges for the species (6) (9). Bach Ma National Park lies within the historical range of this species and a poster campaign to obtain local information was conducted there in 1996 and 1997 but as yet there have been no confirmed records from this park. In December 2003 the captive population numbered 1033 individuals (6). A studbook was first developed in the 1960s and abandoned in the 1970s owing to lack of resources but efforts were renewed in the 1990s (7) and an international studbook now helps coordinate breeding to ensure that the captive population stays genetically healthy (5). Although there have been problems with <strong>inbreeding</strong> and <strong>hybridisation</strong> in captivity screening is thankfully helping eliminate hybrids from much of the captive stock (6). Having long been thought extinct (5) Edwards\u2019s pheasant now clings to a precarious existence and it is imperative that the rampant deforestation is stopped and conservation efforts kept up if this rare pheasant is to be saved from the very real possibility of extinction it now faces (6).

Kleinmann’s tortoise, Leith’s tortoise,Egyptian tortoise ,Animalia,Chordata,Reptilia,Testudines,Testudinidae,Testudo (1),Carapace length: 14.4 cm (2),The main threats endangering the Egyptian tortoise are intensive commercial collection and habitat destruction leading to the disappearance of the species from much of its former range (8). Agricultural expansion cultivation overgrazing and urban encroachment have put enormous pressure on the Egyptian tortoise\u2019s fragile and dwindling habitat dramatically reducing available vegetation for food and cover (1) (8). Additionally the species has suffered heavily in Egypt from collection for the national and international pet trade which moved its attention to Libyan stock after Egyptian subpopulations were harvested to extinction. Trade in this species also exists in Libya itself which is a major concern for the future of the remaining world population (1).,The Egyptian tortoise is protected by law in Egypt but not in Libya. Additionally the tortoise is listed under Appendix I of CITES prohibiting international trade in the species. However these protective laws are evidently often flouted. Protected areas exist in Egypt including the one in which the two individuals were found in 2001 but there is little benefit of this protection or indeed motivation to establish new protected areas for the species since it is effectively extinct in Egypt. This tortoise may also occur in Kouf National Park in northeast Libya where one specimen was found 20 years ago but no other reserves exist in the species\u2019 known range. The establishment of more protected areas in Libya would be of enormous benefit to the Egyptian tortoise and greatly enhance its chances of survival. Although tracts of suitable habitat still remain in Libya there is an all too realistic possibility that the Egyptian tortoise could face extinction in less than 20 years if habitat degradation and trade cannot be stopped (1).

Animalia,Elkhorn coral ,Animalia,Cnidaria,Anthozoa,Scleractinia,Acroporidae,Acropora (1),,Staghorn corals face the many threats that are impacting coral reefs globally. At present around one third of the world's reef-building corals are threatened with extinction. The principal threat to corals is the rise in sea temperature associated with global climate change. This leads to coral bleaching where the symbiotic algae are expelled leaving the corals weak and vulnerable to an increasing variety of harmful diseases. Climate change is also expected cause more extreme weather incidents and to increase ocean acidification which impairs the coral's ability to form a skeleton. These global threats are compounded by localised threats from pollution destructive fishing practices invasive species and human development (6).,Staghorn corals are listed on Appendix II of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) and therefore trade in this coral should be carefully regulated and a permit is required to bring the coral or objects made from them into the countries that have signed the CITES convention (2). Staghorn corals will also form part of the marine community in many marine protected areas or in areas where management plans are in place to protect the coral community. In some areas coral reefs restoration attempts are being undertaken; in Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary efforts have been made to reattach coral fragments or culture and settle coral larvae. Both activities have had limited success and new techniques are being pursued (5).

River pipefish,Estuarine pipefish ,Animalia,Chordata,Actinopterygii,Syngnathiforms,Syngnathidae,Syngnathus (1),Length: up to 13 cm (2),The loss of this species from the majority of its former range has been attributed to altered river systems caused by the construction of upstream dams. These developments restrict the supply of fresh water that brings with it essential nutrients required by the <strong>phytoplankton</strong> upon which the food chain depends (5). Much excitement greeted the discovery of an additional population of this pipefish in the East Kleinemonde Estuary but these fish are under increasing threat and not least because they are the last remaining members of the species (6). Developments along the river have led to silting problems; the creation of artificial beaches and the removal of reed beds have further threatened the delicate estuary ecosystem (6).,With the discovery of the remnant population of this species in 1996 the Western District Council adopted a management plan to protect this rare pipefish (6). Measures included a public awareness programme and the discouragement of powerboat riding. Unfortunately the plan has been poorly enforced and illegal developments along with an increase in planned developments have proliferated in the area (6). Unless stricter measures are bought into effect quickly it is likely that the river pipefish will become extinct once more this time with no reprieve.

Animalia,Ethiopian short-headed frog ,Animalia,Chordata,Amphibia,Anura,Microhylidae,Balebreviceps (1),Snout-vent length: up to 5.3 cm (2),Although reported to be fairly numerous at the site from which it was first recorded in 1986 the Ethiopian short-headed frog is thought to be restricted to a relatively small area and its habitat may be declining (1). The increasing human population in the Ethiopian Highlands is putting pressure on the land through agricultural development and overgrazing (2) (5) and although direct damage to the narrow belt of giant heath occupied by this frog is not thought likely in the near future any such damage would pose a significant threat to the species (1). Indirect effects of the logging of adjoining forests at slightly lower elevations may also threaten the Ethiopian short-headed frog (1) while other factors such as climate change and disease may present future problems (6).,The Ethiopian short-headed frog occurs within the Bale Mountains National Park although this area has yet to be officially gazetted (1) (2) (5). Conservation priorities for this unique and little-known amphibian include the protection of <em>Erica</em> heath and woodland and further survey work to better understand the species\u2019 ecology status and distribution (1).

common eel,European eel ,Animalia,Chordata,Actinopterygii,Anguilliformes,Anguillidae,Anguilla (1),Length: up to 1 m (2),The population of the European eel is threatened at present and eel stocks have declined in recent years. However there is currently very little scientific knowledge of this species which would aid its management. The threats facing the species are unknown; however pollution overfishing habitat degradation parasite infection and changes in climate have all been forwarded as potential causes of the decline (6).,The European Union is currently funding research that aims to halt the decline of the European eel population (6).

Habitat loss and degradation are serious threats to this sensitive species in parts of Europe (1) (8) where hydroelectric developments and water pollution have increased significantly over the past few decades (8).,In 2011 the IUCN upgraded the status of the European mink from Endangered (EN) to Critically Endangered (CR) due to an ongoing population decline (1). There are many captive breeding programmes underway for this species in many range states which are attempting to successfully establish new European mink populations. Further research is also being undertaken into the European mink\xe2\x80\x99s reproduction artificial insemination and responses to captivity to assess the viability of captive breeding as a technique for its conservation (1).

Plantae,False gumwood ,Plantae,Tracheophyta,Magnoliopsida,Asterales,Compositae,Commidendrum (1),Height: up to 3 m (1),With just eight plants remaining the false gumwood is in an extremely perilous position. Its demise began with the discovery of St Helena Island in 1502; ever since the false gumwood has been used as timber for fires (2) and huge areas of its habitat have been cleared for pastures and the grazing of goats (2). Forests once inhabited by the false gumwood have been all but destroyed and native flora now covers less than one percent of the island\u2019s area (5).,There has been a significant amount of conservation action aimed at preserving all <strong>endemic</strong> flora of St. Helena. The earliest action during the 1970s was the control of the goat population on the island (4) after it was recognised that goats were causing major damage to almost all of St. Helena\u2019s wooded habitats (4). There are currently only a few wild goats left and all domestic goats must be kept penned by law (4). Then during 1985 conservation areas were created and under the Endangered Plants Propagation Programmehabitats where the false gumwood occurred were designated as <strong>endemic</strong> forest reserves (6).

Competition with introduced species is likely to be responsible for this decline (2). Today populations are extremely reduced and <i>Pteris adscensionis</i> is thought to be the most threatened of Ascension\u2019s flora with less than 200 plants remaining in the wild (3).,Ascension Conservation is carrying out vital cultivation of this species and is monitoring the highly vulnerable wild population (3).

Marattia purpurascens,Fern ,Plantae,Polypodiophyta,Filicopsida,Marattiales,Marattiaceae,Ptisana (1),Frond length: up to 1 m (2),The main threats to this rare fern are habitat loss due to the planting of <strong>evergreen</strong> trees and degradation due to invasive plants (1). <em>Ptisana purpurascens</em> is also under threat from competition with introduced species and grazing by sheep although this is not currently a common occurrence (3).,<em>Ptisana purpurascens</em> is the largest of Ascension Islands\u2019 native plants and its population is being monitored by Ascension Conservation (3). The entire population of this species in found within Green Mountain National Park which may offer it some protection (1).

Iguane à crête de Fidji,Fiji crested iguana ,Animalia,Chordata,Reptilia,Squamata,Iguanidae,Brachylophus (1),300 g (2),Iguanas are often feared by local people and are therefore treated with little tolerance (5). The main threat to survival of the crested iguana however comes from habitat destruction. Particular devastation is caused by introduced goats which were brought to Fiji in an effort improve the quality of life of local people (5). Goats have been released on fairly uninhabited islands where they graze on native trees and shrubs making these tropical paradises uninhabitable for iguanas (5).,The National Trust for Fiji (assisted by Taronga Zoo Sydney and the Kula Eco Park in Fiji) has worked for many years to preserve this enigmatic lizard (5). Yaduataba Island was cleared of goats in 1981 and declared a national sanctuary; today it is home to several thousand crested iguanas (5). A three year Fijian Crested Iguana Project has also been formulated by the Taronga Zoo Kula Eco Park Fijian National Trust and other organisations (8). Educational programmes and research along with a captive breeding programme are all part of this multi-faceted conservation initiative (5).

Blue skate, common skate, grey skate,Flapper skate ,Animalia,Chordata,Chondrichthyes,Rajiformes,Rajidae,Dipturus (1),Male length: up to 205 cm (2)Female length: up to 285 cm (2),Flapper skates are long-lived and slow to mature factors that make them particularly vulnerable to both direct and accidental targeting by the fishing industry (2). During the mid 20th Century skates and rays made up a considerable amount of commercial fishing in the United Kingdom (6). The population of flapper skates has seen a drastic decline in European waters following this intensive fishing pressure. Although no longer targeted in the majority of areas as the population is too low these fish are still threatened by fisheries <strong>bycatch</strong> (2).,Further research on the distribution of the species and the monitoring of life-cycles growth and so on will also need to be undertaken in order to successfully manage the recovery of this fish (2).

Flat-backed spider tortoise, kapidolo, Madagascar flat-shelled tortoise, Malagasy flat-tailed tortoise,Flat-shelled spider tortoise ,Animalia,Chordata,Reptilia,Testudines,Testudinidae,Pyxis (1),Carapace length: up to 13.4 cm (2)Male weight: 300 – 400 g (2)Female weight: 475 – 670 g (2),Like Madagascar\u2019s other tortoises the flat-shelled spider tortoise has been severely threatened by rampant degradation of its habitat and harvesting for the international pet trade (2). Deforestation has been widespread largely due to conversion to agriculture and timber extraction (2) (5) (6). The species\u2019 already precarious position has been compounded by excessive harvesting to sell to private collectors which has resulted in its total elimination from some forest fragments. This species has also been sold in Chinese marketplaces for food. Even since their listing on Appendix I of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) with export of wild specimens therefore banned there have still been reports of tortoises being smuggled out illegally. In addition there are serious concerns that specimens advertised as \u2018captive-bred\u2019 are really captured from the wild. Given that the species has a low reproductive rate and it is mostly breeding females that are collected the flat-shelled spider tortoise has little capacity to recover from sustained over-harvesting.  Floods caused by cyclones are one of the natural threats which this species has to endure (2).,The majority of the flat-shelled tortoise\u2019s range now occurs within the recently designated Menabe Antimena protected area which offers some hope that a significant proportion of its remaining habitat will be preserved (6). Other protected areas of forest occur within this species\u2019 range such as the special Andranomena Forest Reserve and private Analabe Reserve but regulations are believed to have been rarely enforced and the precise status of the species in these areas is currently unknown (2).

Kinosternon depressum,Flattened musk turtle ,Animalia,Chordata,Reptilia,Testudines,Kinosternidae,Sternotherus (1),Carapace length: up to 12 cm (2),The flattened musk turtle is most seriously threatened by habitat degradation and fragmentation and remaining populations are further threatened by disease pollution and siltation of its habitat and over-collection from the wild for the pet trade (2) (3) (7) (8). Pollution from mining forestry agricultural and industrial chemicals and residential sewage is thought to be responsible for the high levels of shell erosion and infections recently observed in this species as well as reducing numbers of <strong>molluscs</strong> and other <strong>invertebrates</strong> on which the species feeds (2). Excessive sediment accumulation (siltation) also appears to be having a dramatic impact on this small turtle possibly through smothering <strong>molluscs</strong> and other <strong>invertebrate</strong> food sources altering the habitat where this turtle seeks food and cover and accumulating heavy metals and chemical toxins (2) (3). In the 1970s and 80s commercial collecting for the pet trade further reduced some populations with large collections having been recorded and individuals advertised in several places for over 80 U.S. dollars each (2) (3) (4). It is also hard for flattened musk turtle populations to recover from any adverse changes due to its slowness to mature and low reproductive rate (see \u2018Biology\u2019) (2).,A bill passed by the Alabama legislature in May 1984 prohibits the taking of this species from the wild and may be a deterrent to commercial overexploitation in the future (9). The flattened musk turtle is also protected as threatened under the US Endangered Species Act of 1973 as amended. It is therefore a nationally-recognised species of concern and is fully protected by law. In addition a Federal Recovery Plan has been approved (2) (4).

Animalia,Floreana coral ,Animalia,Cnidaria,Anthozoa,Scleractinia,Dendrophylliidae,Tubastraea (1),,Thought to once have been fairly widespread around the Gal\xe1pagos Islands since the <strong>El Ni\xf1o</strong> event of 1982-83 this coral has only been found at Cousins Rocks and Gardner Islet and despite searches specifically for this species Floreana coral has not been seen at Cousins Rocks since 2001 (1).    This suggests that Floreana coral populations suffered mortalities as a result of the <strong>El Ni\xf1o</strong> event and it is therefore likely that any other alterations to the water temperatures surrounding the Gal\xe1pagos Islands such as global climate change will also threaten this coral (1).,The unique biodiversity of the Gal\xe1pagos Islands and the surrounding waters is recognised and valued and thus the region is protected by being designated a Marine Reserve and World Heritage Site (1).  Floreana coral is also included in Appendix II of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) meaning that any international trade in this species should be carefully regulated (2).  Unfortunately neither of these measures protects this Critically Endangered coral from the threats of natural or man-induced climate change.

Charles mockingbird,Floreana mockingbird ,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Mimidae,Mimus (1),Length: 25 cm (2),With only 20 to 50 individuals left on Champion islet and an estimated 300 to 500 on Gardner (as of 2009) the Floreana mockingbird is one of the rarest and most threatened birds in the world (11). Its original extinction from Floreana was probably a combination of several factors including the introduction of black rats (<i>Rattus rattus</i>) and the loss of <i>Opuntia </i>habitat brought about by invasive herbivores (2) (3) (5). In contrast declines recorded in the two remaining satellite populations in some years are thought to be being primarily driven by an increase in the frequency of dry <strong>La Ni\xf1a</strong> years which lead to high levels of adult mortality (2) (5) (12). Due to its isolation since the extinction of the main population on Floreana Island the Champion population has lost a significant amount of genetic diversity and given its precariously small size is in a severely vulnerable state (2) (11). Fortunately the population on Gardner still contains a higher number of individuals and relatively high levels of genetic diversity (11). However a single extreme weather event or newly introduced predators could easily decimate the entire surviving population. This is not to mention the ever present spectre of an avian disease spreading to the mockingbird population or the introduction of the black rat from neighbouring Floreana (2) (5) (11).,In 2008 the Charles Darwin Foundation in collaboration with several other international organisations set out an emergency management plan to preserve the imperilled Floreana mockingbird by reintroducing it to its original home on Floreana. This bold scheme is expected to be carried out in phases over a period of approximately ten years. The initial phase will involve eradicating all introduced species from Floreana and developing a program to breed mockingbirds in captivity. This will be followed by the first release trials of wild or captive bred birds and finally the supervision and monitoring of the released population (11) (12). It is hoped that the first phases of the reintroduction will be started in 2009 the bicentenary of the birth of Charles Darwin (12) (13).

Only 10 mature trees are known and such a small population is inherently vulnerable to any chance event that may occur. These trees are also vulnerable due to the current limited dispersal of their seeds (2).,The forest coconut is found within an area of the Masoala Peninsula that has recently been declared a National Park; the survival of the species will depend largely on the effectiveness of this park (4).

forest little owl, forest spotted owlet,Forest owlet ,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Strigiformes,Strigidae,Heteroglaux (1),Length: 23cm (2),A fragmented population of between 100 and 250 forest owlets is believed to be left in the wild (2). Given the relative rarity of this bird the severity of the various threats to the forest owlet are hard to discern. The\xa0<strong>deciduous forest</strong>\xa0on which the entire population relies has been severely exploited and the reduction of this habitat is thought to be the predominant strain on the surviving population. The degradation of the habitat is the result of local illegal tree felling for firewood and timber and also to provide space for farming and for new settlements (2).,Since its rediscovery research has been carried out to better understand the forest owlet. At the site of its rediscovery further forest losses have successfully been prevented and due to the area\u2019s strict protection Melghat Tiger Reserve remains the sturdiest sanctuary providing the perfect environment for roughly 100 individuals. A programme has been initiated that aims to increase the education and awareness of the locals about their environment (2).

Frégate beetle, Frégate Island beetle, giant Frégate beetle, giant tenebrionid beetle, Seychelles Frégate beetle,Frigate Island giant tenebrionid beetle ,Animalia,Arthropoda,Insecta,Coleoptera,Tenebrionidae,Polposipus (1),Length: 25 – 30 mm (2),Since the relatively recent human colonisation of Fr\xe9gate Island habitat destruction has been extensive.  However the beetles remained abundant on the island and also survived the invasion by introduced predators (brown rats) (5). A fungal disease affecting the sangdragon trees on which this beetle relies may represent a threat to the species (3) (5). Indeed being restricted to just a single small island leaves the Frigate Island giant tenebrionid beetle particularly vulnerable to the effects of introduced alien species or disease as well as to natural disasters or extreme environmental events such as typhoons (5) (6).,In 2001 a successful rat eradication programme on Fr\xe9gate was undertaken removing this potential predator and threat (2) and population assessments were carried out in 1999 and 2001 (5). A breeding and research programme was also established at the Zoological Society of London\u2019s Invertebrate Conservation Unit in 1996 with the hope that the information gained would better inform conservation management in the wild (3) (6). The initial captive population has now expanded to a full European Breeding Programme and involves institutions in the UK Netherlands Poland and Latvia (3). One potential conservation measure is the translocation of the beetle to other islands near Fr\xe9gate either from wild or captive stock (4). In addition the DNA of this rare species has been entered and preserved in the \u2018Frozen Ark\u2019 (3).

Indigo-winged parrot.,Fuertes’s parrot ,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Psittaciformes,Psittacidae,Hapalopsittaca (1),Size: 24 cm (2),Fuertes\u2019s parrot has an extremely small estimated population of just 50 to 250 individuals and occupies a precariously small range. Forests in the region have been extensively cleared so that little suitable habitat now remains. Furthermore it is thought that the species could be declining as a result of possible displacement by or even <strong>hybridisation</strong> with the rusty-faced parrot (<i>H. amazonina</i>). Although no major threats have been identified such a small range and population renders the species extremely vulnerable (5).,Fuertes\u2019s parrot is protected in the Alto Quind\xedo Acaime and Ca\xf1on del Quind\xedo Natural Reserves (5). Following the incredible rediscovery of this colourful parrot there has been a surge of conservation work in the region and nest boxes have been provided where few mature trees suitable for nesting remained. This initiative has been highly successful with 21 nest boxes active in 2005 and each box producing three chicks twice a year helping population numbers to slowly climb (4).

Animalia,Galapagos land snail ,Animalia,Mollusca,Gastropoda,Stylommatophora,Bulimulidae,Bulimulus (1),,Since its colonisation in 1920 the human population on Santa Cruz has multiplied dramatically leading to the decline of suitable habitat for land snails as farming and road and house construction grew (1) (2). In addition habitat alteration and introduced species of plants and animals are also thought to have had a negative impact (1) (3).,There are currently no conservation measures targeting this species.

Dark-rumped petrel,Galapagos petrel ,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Procellariiformes,Procellariidae,Pterodroma (1),Length: 43 cm (2)Wingspan: 91 cm (3),Following the proliferation of introduced cats dogs pigs and black and brown rats on the Galapagos Islands in the 1980s the Galapagos petrel has suffered a rapid decline in numbers perhaps as much as on 80 percent reduction. Rats feed on eggs and chicks with dogs cats and pigs also taking adults. In addition the Galapagos hawk <i>Buteo galapagoensis</i> has been responsible for large losses of the adult population (2).,The Galapagos Islands are a national park and a World Heritage Site and are therefore protected. Some predator control has been carried out but a continuing programme is crucial to prevent the rat population re-establishing itself. Proposed schemes to prevent further decline of the Galapagos petrel include monitoring the breeding success of different populations under various predator control systems in order to determine the most successful (2).

Gavial Du Gange,Gharial ,Animalia,Chordata,Reptilia,Crocodylia,Gavialidae,Gavialis (1),Male length: 5 - 6 m (2)Female length: 3.5 - 4.5 m (2),The gharial came incredibly close to extinction in the 1970s but a long-term captive breeding and re-introduction program was instrumental in improving the species status in the wild over the following decades. Despite these efforts between 1997 and 2006 the wild population declined by 58 percent from 436 to just 182 breeding adults (1). Habitat loss and degradation poses the biggest threat to this species\u2019 survival as the human population explosion of the Indian subcontinent continues to encroach on the river systems where it is found (5). Dams irrigation projects sand mining and artificial embankments have all encroached on the gharial\u2019s habitat reducing its range to just two percent of what it was (1). In addition fishing removes important food sources and can cause clashes with fishermen leading to accidental or deliberate death. Eggs are collected for medicinal properties and adult males are hunted due to the belief that the snout has aphrodisiac effects (5).,Gharial population levels reached a catastrophic low in the 1970s prompting a massive rescue campaign (4). Restocking programmes involving captive breeding and ranching (wild eggs reared in captivity and then re-released) were established in India in 1975 and Nepal in 1978 and these worked to gradually bring this species back from the brink of extinction (5). However in recent years the population has suffered another devastating decline and in 2006 less than 200 breeding adults remained in the wild (1). The current decline indicates that no matter how many gharials are released into the wild habitat degradation and hunting need to be prevented to ensure the species\u2019 survival. Consequently the focus of current conservation efforts is moving away from captive breeding programmes towards other initiatives such as the protection of gharial habitat enforcement of the species\u2019 protected status and the education and involvement of local people in the species\u2019 conservation. At the forefront of this is the Gharial Conservation Alliance an international organisation of individuals dedicated to saving gharials from extinction (2).

Celestus carraui, Diploglossus carraui, Diploglossus warreni,Giant Hispaniolan galliwasp ,Animalia,Chordata,Reptilia,Squamata,Anguidae,Celestus (1),Celestus (1),Habitat loss predation and hunting have led to an estimated 80 percent decline in giant Hispaniolan galliwasp population numbers over the last 20 years. One of the main threats to this species is deforestation mostly due to agricultural activities (1). Lowland broadleaf forests once accounted for more than half of the vegetation on the island but almost none now remain intact and the giant Hispaniolan galliwasp\u2019s habitat is now highly fragmented (1).,General Law on Environment and Natural Resources of the Dominican Republic gives general protection for all its biodiversity <strong><strong>(1)</strong></strong>.

Mekong giant catfish,Giant catfish ,Animalia,Chordata,Actinopterygii,Siluriformes,Pangasiidae,Pangasianodon (1),up to 300 kg (1),The giant catfish has been subject to over-fishing for many years. Catches at the beginning of the 20th century were in the thousands each year but declines have been so severe that less than ten are now caught per year (1). Habitat loss and degradation as a result of damming and the clearance of flooded forest near the Tonle Sap Lake (1) have disrupted the giant catfish\u2019s migration spawning eating and breeding habits (5).,The giant catfish has been listed on Appendix I of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species since 1975 when it first became apparent that it had seriously declined. It occurs in a Biosphere Reserve and a RAMSAR site (for wetlands of international significance) but both fail to provide active protection. In Cambodia and Thailand it is illegal to catch the giant catfish but this legislation is not enforced. In Laos it is protected but again this has no practical effect (1).

Animalia,Giant ibis ,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Ciconiiformes,Threskiornithidae,Thaumatibis (1),Length: 102 – 106 cm (2),Continuing deforestation and wetland drainage for agriculture has led to widespread habitat loss for the giant ibis although much suitable but unoccupied habitat still remains. This suggests that hunting and human disturbance may be the most serious threats to the giant ibis (2).,The giant ibis gains official protection from its presence in Xe Pian National Biodiversity Area in Laos and in Lomphat Wildlife Sanctuary Cambodia. Both Laos and Cambodia are running a campaign to reduce the hunting of large water birds and the giant ibis is illustrated on public awareness material. Surveys to monitor the giant ibis\u2019 population and distribution have been proposed as well as research to discover their breeding habits and requirements (2). The creation of further protected areas has been recommended (2) and captive breeding will be considered. Crucially gun ownership must be further controlled following the success of such schemes in Laos (4).

The spread of this disease is thought to be escalated by increasing temperatures caused by global warming (7).,The golden arrow poison frog is protected by law in Panama and is found in many protected areas within its range (1). Captive breeding programmes in many zoos throughout the United States and at the El Valle Amphibian Conservation Centre in Panama have been successful although until certain threats have been addressed the captive-bred individuals cannot be safely returned to the wild (1) (2) (4).

golden mantella,Golden frog ,Animalia,Chordata,Amphibia,Anura,Mantellidae,Mantella (1),Length: 20-26 mm (2),The golden frog\xa0is very popular in the pet-trade and over-collection of individuals is still carried out at some areas. Although at present there are no signs of reduction of population size due to this take off it must be carefully monitored in the future to assure the survivorship of the species (5). Furthermore large-scale deforestation predation by introduced species and encroachment by humans are all posing threats to\xa0the golden frog\xa0(4).,All mantella frogs are listed on Appendix II of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) which controls international trade in these species (2). The golden frog is bred in captivity in a number of zoos and other breeding facilities including the Detroit Zoological Institute\u2019s National Amphibian Conservation Centre which breeds hundreds each year for use in breeding programmes in other institutions (6). The provision of captive-bred individuals to zoos reduces the stress on wild populations caused by collection. Captive breeding programmes may also provide a genetic reservoir of a species to safeguard it should the population undergo a drastic decline or even become extinct; they also provide sources of animals for reintroduction to the wild and allow research to be carried out (6). Although captive breeding is an important facet of any conservation programme protection of the remaining wild populations and the habitat on which they depend is of great importance (7).

Queimada Island bothrops,Golden lancehead ,Animalia,Chordata,Reptilia,Squamata,Viperidae,Bothropoides (1),Length: up to 110 cm (2),The golden lancehead has one of the largest population densities of any snake (4). However its overall population is relatively small between 2000 and 4000 individuals (4) (12) and is restricted to a single tiny island where its habitat is under threat from deforestation and burning (1) (4) (11). Its population is believed to have decreased in recent decades exacerbated by the removal of snakes from the island for the illegal wild animal trade (4) (11) (12) (13).,<i><em>Bothropoides</em></i> species are highly venomous and are considered to be particularly dangerous to humans as a group being responsible for about 90 percent of all serious snakebites in South America (6). However in recent years studies have shown the venom of the golden lancehead to have practical applications for humans with many potential medical uses making it even more important to protect this snake (4).

El Tucuche golden frog, Trinidad heart-tongued frog,Golden tree frog ,Animalia,Chordata,Amphibia,Anura,Hylidae,Phytotriades (1),Maximum length: 4 cm (2),As there are just two known populations of the Critically Endangered golden tree frog in the world it is extremely vulnerable to the degradation of what little habitat remains. This little-known frog is further threatened by the over-collecting of specimens and of bromeliads (1). In addition declines in the population at Cerro del Aripo may be attributed to the chytrid fungus <em>Batrachochytrium</em> a disease causing fungi that is inflicting dramatic declines upon <strong>amphibian</strong> populations worldwide (2).\xa0,As this rare frog has an extremely limited range there is a pressing need to protect the golden tree frog\u2019s habitat. The importance of this is increased by the species\u2019 specialisation upon a single bromeliad species (1). El Tucuche is managed as a game reserve and access to the mountain requires government permission; however policing this legislation has proved challenging (2). Consequently in the absence of specific conservation measures the extent and quality of its habitat is continuing to dwindle (1) (2).

Animalia,Golden white-eye ,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Zosteropidae,Cleptornis (1),Length: 14 cm (2),In the past 20 years this species has gone from being of no conservation concern to the brink of extinction (1). An expanding human population has undoubtedly had an impact on the species (7) despite its ability to persist in a range of habitats (2). Between 1982 and 2007 the human population on Saipan quadrupled resulting in development of much more of the island. During this period of the 11 land bird species found on Saipan the golden white-eye and two other species decreased in number (7).,The Mariana Avifauna Conservation Project aims to protect birds in the Mariana archipelago from the brown tree snake by forming populations of the native bird species via a captive breeding programme (6). Between 2007 and 2008 46 golden white-eyes were taken into captivity with the aim of initiating captive breeding in the near future (2). The continued control of brown tree snakes through trapping is an essential component of any conservation plan if this rare bird is to survive (2). \xa0

Since then the population is likely to have declined further as around eight percent of <strong>cloud forest</strong> in Serran\xeda del Pinche is degraded every year by agriculture primarily for the cultivation of coca (<em>Erythroxylum coca</em>) (2) (3).,Local authorities the Ministry of Environment The Hummingbird Conservancy Ecohabits Foundation and local residents are all working together on an ongoing conservation plan which aims to protect the habitat of the Serran\xeda del Pinche and promote local conservation and education initiatives (2). Further studies to determine the population size and status of the gorgeted puffleg along with the creation of a protected area within the Serran\xeda del Pinche have been proposed (3).

Gough finch,Gough bunting ,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Emberizidae,Rowettia (1),Size: 18cm (2),This bird\u2019s occurrence in a restricted habitat of one very small island makes it extremely vulnerable to natural disasters like fires and hurricanes or to introduced diseases and especially to the accidental introduction of non-native predators (3). Indeed the introduced house mouse <i>Mus musculus </i>poses the greatest present threat through competition and predation (2). Buntings are found at low density in lowland areas where mice are abundant (2) and experiments with \u2018dummy\u2019 eggs imply that mouse predation on their nests is very high (5). Thus researchers think the bird may have been forced by these mice from the best nesting sites into less suitable upland regions (5). Over the last 15 years the proportion of juveniles in the population has declined from 50% to 20% this appears to indicate that there are now too few young surviving to reproductive age to sustain the population.,Gough Island is both a Nature Reserve and World Heritage Site and while this provides good protection from human disturbance it does not offer the Gough bunting any protection from the mouse predation that is driving it towards extinction (2). A study of the mice conducted by The Royal Society for the Protection of Birds (RSPB) and funded by the UK government's Overseas Territories Environment Programme has shown that their eradication from the island is feasible. Unfortunately however until adequate funding from the UK government is supplied this will not occur (6). Gough Island is widely recognised as having one of the most diverse bird colonies in the world including four endangered species and every effort should therefore be made to protect it and the rich biodiversity it hosts (7).

Plantae,Grass ,Plantae,Tracheophyta,Liliopsida,Cyperales,Gramineae,Sporobolus (1),Height: less than 10 cm (2),It is thought that <i>Sporobolus caespitosus</i> was previously more abundant than it is today. It may be suffering from competition with introduced species such as the grasses <i>Sporobolus africanus</i> <i>Melinis minutiflora</i> and <i>Paspalum conjungatum</i> (3).,Ascension Conservation is involved with monitoring the population of this rare grass and will be in a position to assess the effects of competition (3).

Avutarda India, Avutarda Índica,Great Indian bustard ,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Gruiformes,Otididae,Ardeotis (1),Male length: 122 cm (2)Female length: 92 cm (2),The great Indian bustard has become extinct in almost 90 percent\xa0of its former range principally as a result of loss of habitat and poaching (6). The conversion of the land for agriculture and widespread hunting which became more prevalent with the onset of vehicle transport have both contributed to the precipitous decline in this species (2).,The great Indian bustard is listed in Schedule I of the Wildlife (Protection) Act of 1972 in India and international trade is prohibited by its listing on Appendix I of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) (5). A number of sanctuaries have been set up with the aim of preserving this species; however this may not be the most effective means of conservation as population numbers have continued to decline. The Bombay Natural History Society (BNHS) is urging the Indian Government to adopt a \u2018Project Bustard\u2019 scheme along the same lines of \u2018Project Tiger\u2019 (5). Such a high-profile project would be invaluable for raising awareness about the plight of India\u2019s 4 bustard species and would be an important method of preserving the arid grassland habitat that is currently poorly protected in this country (6).

Hapalemur simus,Greater bamboo lemur ,Animalia,Chordata,Mammalia,Primates,Lemuridae,Prolemur (1) (2),2.2 - 2.5 kg (3),The rainforests of Madagascar are being widely cleared by slash-and-burn techniques and this habitat destruction is one of the major threats to the survival of the greater bamboo lemur (3). Bamboo is also being cleared in some areas and this lemur is targeted by hunters in other regions (3). The known range of the greater bamboo lemur is highly restricted and this implies further threats to survival (3).,The greater bamboo lemur is protected within two areas in Madagascar however even within Ranomafana National Park the native trees are being exploited and this species is at risk (3). Further research into these little-known lemurs is urgently needed and more extensive surveys of the area may well reveal further isolated populations in need of protection (3).

The brooks in Greece on which much of the remaining population appears to rely are particularly threatened (1).,There are currently no conservation initiatives targeting this species. It has been suggested that there is a need for surveys on the Peloponnisos and Corfu to establish the extent of the species\u2019 range. If no populations are found to lie in protected areas obtaining legal protection for at least some of the population would become a priority. It has been recommended that a conservation action plan for the brook habitats of the Peloponnisos is developed which would benefit the rich array of <strong>endemic</strong> dragonflies in this area (1).

Plantae,Green pitcher plant ,Plantae,Tracheophyta,Magnoliopsida,Nepenthales,Sarraceniaceae,Sarracenia (1),Pitcher height: 20 - 75 cm (2),The green pitcher plant has suffered a devastating decline throughout its former range. Development for both urban and rural uses has led to the widespread alteration of the specific bog habitat of this species (5). Pitcher plants have also been over-collected for the commercial plant trade; such exotic species are very popular with collectors (5). Today around 34 naturally occurring populations persist but these are small and highly fragmented; most consist of fewer than 50 individuals (5).,Green pitcher plants are listed as Endangered on the United States Endangered Species Act and there is an Action Plan for their recovery (2). The Recovery Plan focuses on the effective protection of existing populations as the most important threat to the future of the green pitcher plant is over-collection (5). Collection is banned by legislation within the States and also internationally by the listing of this species on Appendix I of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) (3). <glos><i>Ex-situ</i></glos> conservation measures are also in place; seeds are stored at the USDA National Seed Technology Laboratory in Fort Collins and Atlanta Botanical Garden is propagating plants from seeds for future reintroduction programmes (5).

longcomb sawfish, narrow-snout sawfish,Green sawfish ,Animalia,Chordata,Chondrichthyes,Rajiformes,Pristidae,Pristis (1),Male size at maturity: 430 cm (2),The main threat facing this species is accidental \u2018by-catch\u2019 by prawn fisheries fish trawling gillnetting and other fishing activities (4). Due to the saw and their large size this species becomes entangled in nets very easily; as they are difficult to set free they rarely survive becoming caught in this way (4). Direct fishing has also been a problem; this sawfish has been widely caught for its fins for use in the shark fin soup industry its saw and for its flesh (4). The high price of the fins in Asian markets increase the threats facing all members of this family (3). Furthermore degradation of the soft-bottomed habitats upon which they depend has been widespread (4).,This species is classified as Critically Endangered on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species (1). Current recovery actions include carrying out further research into the distribution and ecology of this sawfish and encouraging its protection (4). It has been proposed that an Australian national recovery team should be established in order to set up and coordinate the recovery programme for this and other threatened sawfish (3).

The campaign is further promoted by local artists and musicians who have made the Grenada dove the subject of songs colourful paintings and billboards with the intention of encouraging local participation in the protection of the dove (3).

Gray-shanked douc langur, Grey-shanked douc langur,Grey-shanked douc ,Animalia,Chordata,Mammalia,Primates,Cercopithecidae,Pygathrix (1),Pygathrix (1),Having declined over recent decades by around 80 percent surveys in 2004 suggest that perhaps as few as 550 to 700 grey-shanked doucs remain in the wild and that with little sign of the threats to the species\u2019 decreasing its population is continuing to fall (1) (4) (8). The main threat to this species is hunting for food and for use in traditional \u2018medicines\u2019 (1). It is also captured in snares for the pet trade although captive animals rarely survive long due to their highly sensitive digestive system (1) (4). At Kon Cha Rang Nature Reserve which contains one of the largest remaining grey-shanked douc populations there is a traditional hunting season in September with large numbers of snares set in trees to catch this monkey (8). The grey-shanked douc is also particularly vulnerable to hunting with guns as in response to disturbance it typically remains motionless in the canopy rather than fleeing (1). This exploitation is compounded by the loss of the grey-shanked douc\u2019s forest habitat which is highly fragmented and degraded and continues to be lost to logging and agriculture at a rate of around 100 square kilometres per year (1). Many communities surrounding these forests employ shifting agricultural strategies with a tendency to convert forest farming and livestock grazing areas greatly increasing the pressure on this rare monkey\u2019s habitat (8).\xa0\xa0,Supporting at least 24 species of primate a quarter of which are thought to be <strong>endemic</strong> the protection of Vietnam\u2019s natural habitats is of critical importance to primate conservation (4). However conservation efforts in Vietnam are far too often hindered by the weakness of the country\u2019s protective legislation and law enforcement allowing hunting and habitat loss to continue to threatened many rare species. This is further compounded by the dependency of many people upon natural resources and the small amount of funds allocated to conservation work (9).\xa0

Margaret River marron, marron,Hairy marron ,Animalia,Arthropoda,Crustacea,Decapoda,Parastacidae,Cherax (1),up to 2 kg (2),Having previously thought that the smooth marron (<i>Cherax cainii</i>) and the hairy marron (<i>Cherax tenuimanus</i>) were the same species people translocated the smooth marron in large numbers into Margaret River. It is now known to out-compete the hairy marron in regions where the river habitat is degraded due to loss of vegetation or poor water flow (5). The hairy marron has suffered an 80\xa0to 90 percent\xa0reduction in numbers due to the human-induced invasion of the smooth marron (4). Other introduced species are also thought to be contributing to the hairy marron\u2019s decline (5).,The Western Australia Department of Conservation and Land Management is working together with the Department of Fisheries and the public to develop and implement a recovery plan for the hairy marron. In addition the importation of non-native crayfish species is banned in Australia to prevent the spread of the crayfish plague fungus that has been responsible for the decline of several European crayfish species (2).

Foca Fraile De Hawaii,Hawaiian monk seal ,Animalia,Chordata,Mammalia,Carnivora,Phocidae,Monachus (1),Male length: 2.1 m (2)Female length: 2.3 m (2)Male weight: 170 kg (2)Female weight: 205 kg (2),During the 1800s Hawaiian monk seals were persecuted for their meat hides and oil; their habitat was also disturbed by bird <strong>guano</strong> and feather collectors (6). Despite protection numbers of these seals continue to decline; an average decline of 3% a year occurred between 1985 and 1999 (6). A lack of food resources especially around French Frigate Shoals has been cited as the cause of high juvenile mortality and the presence of severely emaciated individuals (7). In addition entanglement in marine debris that accumulates in these islands from vast areas of the Pacific as well as disturbance further threatens this species (6). Non-human threats such as predation by sharks and the prevalence of violent \u2018mobbing\u2019 behaviour of mature males also play a part in the decline of monk seal numbers (4).,The Hawaiian monk seal has been listed on the United States Endangered Species List since 1976 and the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) is responsible for the management of the population (7). Major colonies are surveyed annually and beach counts help to give an indication of the state of each breeding population (7); flipper tagging has been carried out since the early 1980s (6). The Northwest Hawaiian Islands lobster fishery was closed in 2000 and this may help to increase prey availability (6). In 2000 the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands Coral Reef Ecosystem Reserve was established which should help to protect the habitat of this unique seal (7).

Major threats to survival come from illegal trade in the turtle's prized shell known as tortoiseshell which has been sought for jewellery and ornaments for centuries. There is also a substantial market for eggs meat and even stuffed juveniles as exotic gifts in some parts of the world (10). Additional pressure on the global population comes from harvests to support traditional customs the loss of nesting sites accidental entanglement in fishing lines and the deterioration of coral reef systems which act as feeding sites for these turtles (11).,International trade in the hawksbill turtle is banned amongst signatory nations by its listing on Appendix I of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) (3)\xa0but extensive illegal trafficking still occurs. Preventing this black market trade is the key to saving this species and TRAFFIC (the wildlife trade monitoring network) is involved in monitoring and highlighting this problem (14). In 1988 the government of the Seychelles took a very public stand against tortoiseshell trade by burning a stockpile of seized shells (4) in a manner reminiscent of burning ivory pyres in Kenya (10).

Animalia,Hemicycla ,Animalia,Mollusca,Gastropoda,Stylommatophora,Helicidae,Hemicycla (1),Length: 24 - 28 mm (2),The natural ecosystems of Gran Canaria are highly deteriorated a situation which has had negative impacts on a variety of <strong>endemic</strong> species (4). Habitat loss has drastically reduced the range of <em>Hemicycla saulcyi</em> and the species is now restricted to a small isolated population occupying a total area of under four square kilometres (2) (4) (5) (6). Most of La Isleta is an old military base which has so far prevented encroachment by the city of Las Palmas de Gran Canaria. However this base is being closed and the likely increase in building and development in the area could be disastrous for this species (2) (5) (7). A further potential threat may come from the spread of introduced snails which are believed to compete with the <strong>endemic</strong> snail species potentially displacing them from some areas (4). Predation by rats mice and lizards may also be a problem (3).,No species of land snail in the Canary Islands currently receives direct legal protection and therefore indirect protection through preservation of its habitat will be all the more vital to both <em>Hemicycla saulcyi</em> and other threatened <strong>endemic</strong> snails (2) (4) (7). It has been recommended that the north-western part of La Isleta be made a Special Nature Reserve in order to prevent building and development in the area. A Recovery Plan has also been recommended to promote the restoration of the natural vegetation (2) (4). With only around thirty living specimens of <em>Hemicycla saulcyi saulcyi</em> observed to date the total population may be tiny (2) (6) and without adequate protection the future for this highly endangered <strong>mollusc</strong> is uncertain.

Poisons used for pest control seem to be inadvertently affecting the lizard population (7).,Plans for conservation of this species are not extensive.  The United Nations and the Canary Islands Autonomous Government funded a program for the captive breeding and <strong>re-introduction</strong> of the Hierro giant lizard to its original natural habitat.  This management plan began in late 1997 and ran until early 2000 (7) (8).  Juveniles are more suitable for re-introduction as the sprint escape performance of the adult lizard is diminished by prolonged captivity (9).

It may also be under threat from road construction (2).,In a collaboration between Mexican researchers from the University of Puebla and staff from the Sir Harold Hillier Gardens and Arboretum in the United Kingdom a conservation strategy for Hinton\u2019s oak has been created. It involves training local people in plant propagation undertaking field research and the production of an educational guide about the conservation of this important species (2).

Hunter’s antelope, Hunter’s hartebeest,Hirola ,Animalia,Chordata,Mammalia,Cetartiodactyla,Bovidae,Beatragus (1),80 - 118 kg (2),Numbers of hirola have declined severely from 10000 in the 1970s to an estimated 500 to 2000 in 1995\xa0to 1996; numbers have fallen by 85 to 90 percent since 1980 (2). Competition with cattle severe drought disease and poaching are all factors that have contributed to devastating hirola populations (3) (4).\xa0Unfortunately the hirola\u2019s preference for areas that are used by livestock puts them at increased risk from diseases like rinderpest and tuberculosis (3).,In 1963 10 to 20 hirola were released into Tsavo East National Park Kenya which grew to a population of 79 individuals by 1996. In 1996 another 29 hirola were <strong>translocated</strong> into the Tsavo East population resulting in an estimated population of 100 hirola in Tsavo East National Park (6).\xa0The Hirola Management Committee (HMC) was also formed in 1994 with the aim of conserving this species in their natural range.\xa0 The HNC created the Hirola Strategic Management Plan which outlined hirola conservation measures for the next five years (7). This included creating protected areas reducing exposure to livestock diseases careful monitoring and promoting income generating eco-tourism for this unique species (7); measures that will hopefully pull this beautiful antelope back from the edge of extinction.

Additionally this iguana is threatened by local subsistence hunting and predation from introduced carnivores such as dogs cats and mongooses. Hunting for Hispaniolan ground iguanas for food and trade has increased gradually since the mid 1970s this species at one time being served at oriental restaurants in Santo Domingo as a speciality dish (1).,International trade in the Hispaniolan ground iguana is controlled by its listing under Appendix I of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) (3). Compliance with CITES trade regulations is largely effective although occasional smuggling of animals across the Haitian border does still occur. Enforcement of national protective legislation in the Dominican Republic has improved in the last few years but fails to go far enough since clearing of natural habitat for development is neither being prevented nor regulated and illegal hunting for food and the local pet market continues (1). However the Isla Cabritos range which used to be intensively exploited for hardwood cutting charcoal and livestock grazing has undergone extensive natural regeneration in the last 15 years and improved protective management since 1992 has meant present conditions there are stable (4). Indianapolis Zoo has had a small but successful captive breeding programme although survivorship of young has been low (1) and there are plans to re-establish new breeding colonies at both the Parque Zoologico Nacional (ZooDom) in the Dominican Republic and the Indianapolis Zoo (4). The establishment of local educational awareness campaigns to try to reduce illegal hunting the strengthening and enforcing of protective legislation and the implementation of research monitoring and recovery programmes will be essential in guiding effective conservation efforts in the future (2).

Kollar's spinetail,Hoary-throated spinetail ,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Furnariidae,Synallaxis (1),ca. 16 g (3),The main threat to the hoary-throated spinetail is the rapid conversion of its habitat to rice plantations with the burning of vegetation potentially posing a further problem (3) (4) (7). Although still thought to be relatively common where it occurs the species is restricted to a tiny and fragmented range none of which is officially protected and is believed to number only around 5000 or so individuals (2) (3) (4) (7). With so little known about the hoary-throated spinetail there is also the potential for unidentified threats to take a toll on the species before they are recognised (9).,Although not occurring within officially protected areas nearly 60 percent of the hoary-throated spinetail\u2019s habitat is inside indigenous reserves where the indigenous people have a much better record of maintaining the ecosystem than non-indigenous peoples. Most rice production in Roraima is carried out illegally by non-indigenous people on indigenous land but in some areas such as S\xe3o Marcos Indigenous Reserve rice producers have been evicted hopefully giving renewed hope for the wildlife there (3) (4) (7). Producers should also have been evicted from Raposa-Serra do Sol following its legalisation in 2005 but this is not yet known to have occurred (3) (7).

Lynx d'Espagne, Lynx pardelle,Iberian lynx ,Animalia,Chordata,Mammalia,Carnivora,Felidae,Lynx (1),5 - 15 kg (2) (3),Numbers of Iberian lynx have been decimated by habitat loss with scrublands converted to agriculture and pine and eucalypt plantations and with human development such as dams highways and railways all encroaching on its native habitat (1) (3). Conversion of habitat and overhunting have also reduced populations of the lynx\u2019s main food source the rabbit and rabbit numbers also declined drastically after the introduction of the myxomatosis virus in the 1950s (1) (3) (5). Whilst myxomatosis is not such a threat today a new disease that arrived in Spain in 1988 known as Rabbit Haemorrhagic Disease is once again threatening rabbit numbers (1)\xa0(3) (5). Despite protection measures and heavy fines illegal hunting continues and the accidental killing of lynx in rabbit traps traps set for smaller carnivores or with poisoned fox bait together with road fatalities are some of the major causes of mortality at present (3) (5).\xa0,The Iberian lynx is legally protected in both <st1:country-region w:st="on">Spain</st1:country-region> and <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Portugal</st1:place></st1:country-region> (1) and is also listed on Appendix I of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) meaning international trade in the species is prohibited (4).

Extensive habitat loss as well as hunting for recreation food and medicine has hugely reduced population numbers leading to its possible extinction (2).,Protected and managed areas of old-growth forest in the Sierra Madre do exist; however illegal drug trafficking and levels of violence are high making conservation of these areas difficult (7).

Vultur indicus,Indian vulture ,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Falconiformes,Accipitridae,Gyps (1),Length: 92 cm (2),In common with other <i>Gyps</i> species the Indian vulture has suffered serious declines since the late 1990s losing as much as 95 percent of the population. The unnaturally high death toll was thought to be caused by a fatal virus but testing has revealed that vultures are suffering from kidney failure following the consumption of cattle that had previously been treated with the anti-inflammatory drug diclofenac (2). In fact the decline is a result of a lethal level of the drug in a small proportion of the <strong>ungulate</strong> carcasses available to vultures but as vultures travel long distances to reach <strong>carrion</strong> a considerable proportion of the population has been affected (7). The full extent of the decline of <i>Gyps</i> vulture species is already being felt by humans as rotting carcasses remain untouched posing a health hazard as well as encouraging feral dog populations which carry rabies (8).,It is considered necessary to prevent exposure of vultures to livestock carcasses that have been contaminated with diclofenac and to find an alternative replacement drug (7). Government commitment to the control of the use of the drug is crucial but until it has been entirely removed from the environment a collaboration of bird protection organisations plan to take all vultures into captivity for the next 20 to 30 years to avoid further deaths which would further reduce the chance of a successful recovery of this already rare species (8).

Animalia,Indochinese box turtle ,Animalia,Chordata,Reptilia,Testudines,Bataguridae,Cuora (1),carapace length: 19 cm (2),Freshwater turtles in South East Asia face a number of threats principally habitat alteration and human exploitation. Forests are being cleared and watercourses altered in the process of cultivating the land for human use which is often achieved at the detriment of the turtles' natural habitat (6). Another major threat to the survival of this species comes from the pet trade; between 1989 and 94 almost 33000 specimens of the genus <i>Corus</i> (Asian box turtles) were imported into the United States (6). An additional threat may come from the increasing demand for turtles for food and medicines especially in China (6).,More information is urgently needed on the distribution and behaviour of this shy box turtle. The Indochinese box turtle is listed on Appendix II of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) (3) but trade remains one of the key features of its decline. More data on distribution of this species is vital if a comprehensive conservation plan is to be established.

The primary threats causing these devastating declines were predation by golden eagles (<i>Aquila chrysaetos</i>) on the northern Channel Islands canine distemper virus (CDV) on Santa Catalina Island and collision with vehicles on San Clemente and San Nicolas Islands (2) (8).,The island fox is listed by the state of California as a threatened species (1) and the islands themselves also receive protection. Santa Rosa San Miguel and Santa Cruz are part of the Channel Islands National Park which is protected by the U.S National Park Service and the western portion of Santa Cruz Island is also protected by The Nature Conservancy. Dogs and cats are prohibited from being brought into the Channel Islands National Park in order to prevent infections from being transmitted to the foxes (6). Santa Catalina Island is owned and managed by the Catalina Island Conservancy (14) and the remaining two islands San Nicolas and San Clemente are owned and managed by the U.S. Navy (1).

Animalia,Itatiaia highland frog ,Animalia,Chordata,Amphibia,Anura,Strabomantidae,Holoaden (1),Snout-vent length: up to 3.7 cm (2),This small frog was previously described as being very abundant at the site from which it was first described (2) and was frequently found up until the 1970s (1). However it has now not been seen in the wild for more than ten years despite extensive searches leading to fears that it may already have become extinct (1). The species has not been recorded outside of one small area of less than ten square kilometres and is believed to have declined due to a reduction in the extent and quality of its habitat as a result of touristic activities and fire. The species is also reported to be affected by extreme frosts (1). It is not known to what extent the Itatiaia highland frog may also have been impacted by factors such as climate change disease and pollution which are presenting great threats to amphibian species worldwide (7).,The range of the Itatiaia highland frog lies within the Parque Nacional do Itatiaia (1) and the species has been listed as Critically Endangered in Brazil (8). Extensive surveys are needed to determine whether this rare amphibian still survives in the wild and if it is found urgent conservation measures will be needed to save the remaining individuals including a conservation management plan and the continued conservation and preservation of its habitat (1).

Animalia,Ivory-billed woodpecker ,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Piciformes,Picidae,Campephilus (1),Size: 48 – 53 cm (2),The ivory-billed woodpecker was known from the southeastern United States and Cuba. Logging mining plantations and other forms of exploitation have swept away the once extensive tracts of pristine forest that were home to this woodpecker. Logging of the mature forests that form its habitat was probably the major cause of the disappearance of this species (2). Although incredible recent discoveries have provided new hope for both the U.S. and Cuban <strong>subspecies</strong> previously considered extinct the ivory-billed woodpecker is nevertheless clinging on to an extremely precarious existence.,Searches for the elusive ivory-billed woodpecker in the mountains of southern Cuba and in the U.S. continue. If sightings are confirmed the implementation of effective protection measures will be vital for the future of this fascinating bird (2).

Jamaican iguana, Jamaican rock iguana,Jamaican ground iguana ,Animalia,Chordata,Reptilia,Squamata,Iguanidae,Cyclura (1),up to 9 kg (3) (4),Traditionally the Jamaican ground iguana was hunted for meat which caused declines in its population in the 19th century (11). Today this species is significantly affected by invasive non-native predators including mongooses cats pigs and stray dogs which eat juvenile iguanas or destroy nests (1) (2) (6) (9) (12).,Much has now been done to try and save the Jamaican ground iguana and this rare lizard is now a flagship species for conservation in the West Indies (6). The Jamaican ground iguana is listed on Appendix I of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) which prohibits international trade in this species (5) and it is also listed as \u2018Endangered\u2019 on the U.S. Endangered Species Act (14). The Portland Bight Protected Area where the Jamaican ground iguana occurs is Jamaica\u2019s largest protected area (1) (7) although its legal protection needs greater enforcement (1) (2).

Rhinocéros De La Sonde,Javan rhinoceros ,Animalia,Chordata,Mammalia,Perissodactyla,Rhinocerotidae,Rhinoceros (1),900 – 2,300 kg (2),The devastating decline the Javan rhinoceros has been largely attributed to hunting for its horn and for other body parts which are used in traditional Chinese medicine (6). In addition habitat loss resulting from logging activities and development has impacted the species and the two critically small populations are also exceptionally vulnerable to disease and natural disasters both of which could wipe out an entire population (6).,In Indonesia the Javan rhino has been legally protected since 1931 and Ujung Kulon National Park was set aside for the conservation of this species. The protected area in which the Vietnamese Javan rhinoceros occurs (previously known as the Cat Loc Nature Reserve) was for many years ineffectively protected (6) but since the Cat Loc area was integrated into the Cat Tien National Park in 1998 more forest guards have been deployed and the conservation organisation WWF has been supporting these teams with better equipment and allowances (7).

Plantae,Jellyfish tree ,Plantae,Tracheophyta,Magnoliopsida,Theales,Medusagynaceae,Medusagyne (1),Leaf length: up to 8 cm (2)Height: up to 10 m (2),The jellyfish tree presents a conundrum in that the seeds seem unable to germinate in the wild; no young plants have been observed in the natural stands (3). Successful cultivation in botanic gardens has occurred in very humid conditions but high humidity is unlikely in the exposed habitat where these trees are found in the wild (3). It has been suggested that jellyfish trees have been lost from the more appropriate habitat of moist forests through competition with other species and climate change (3).,Three of the existing populations of jellyfish tree on the island on Mah\xe9 (Bernica Copolia and Mt. Jasmin) are protected within the Morne Seychellois National Park (3). Although seedlings have been grown in a number of botanic gardens many problems remain and a conservation priority must be further research into the reproductive biology of this intriguing species before any effective Action Plan for its future can be devised (3).

Cursorius bitorquatus,Jerdon’s courser ,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Charadriiformes,Glareolidae,Rhinoptilus (1),Average head-body length: 27 cm (2),Jerdon\u2019s courser has an extremely limited range and a very small population estimated between 50 and 240 individuals (1). The principal threat to Jerdon\u2019s courser is loss and degradation of habitat.\xa0 Inhabiting scrub forest bordering villages and agricultural land it is vulnerable to the effects of livestock overgrazing firewood collecting forest clearing for agriculture bird trapping and direct human disturbance. Extensive areas of suitable habitat have also been lost through quarrying and mining (5) (6). Between 1991 and 2000 an estimated 11 to 15 percent of suitable habitat was lost while forest patches became smaller and fragmented (9). Furthermore the construction in 2005 of the Telugu-Ganga Canal resulted in the loss of Jerdon\u2019s courser habitat and the destruction of one newly-discovered site for the species (6). The recent construction of the Somasilla dam resulted in the relocation of 57 villages to the Lankamalai region bordering Jerdon\u2019s courser habitat. This is expected to increase the disturbances on Jerdon\u2019s courser habitat as the settlers are dependant on the forests for resources such as firewood and livestock grazing (4).\xa0\xa0\xa0,As a direct result of the re-discovery of Jerdon\u2019s courser the Lankamalleswara Wildlife Sanctuary was established with the aims of protecting the species and its habitat (6). Since 2001 the Bombay Natural History Society in collaboration with the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds and the Universities of Cambridge and Reading have been working to determine the distribution and habitat requirements of the species. The application of tracking strips camera traps and audio-playback methodologies have successfully identified new locations for Jerdon\u2019s courser investigated habitat usage and evaluated threats (7) (8). Lobbying against the construction of the Telugu-Ganga canal through the Jerdon\u2019s courser's range successfully avoided further habitat destruction and fragmentation in 1986 but in 2005 the canal project recommenced and resulted in the destruction of some Jerdon\u2019s Courser habitat. However although canal construction proceeded the route was modified to make it less damaging and 1000 hectares of additional land were acquired by the Andhra Pradesh Forest Department in compensation (6) (10). If Jerdon\u2019s courser can be restored on this degraded land the future prospects of the species can be improved (5). Further proposed measures include a radio-telemetry study to determine ecological requirements for the species and the initiation of conservation awareness programmes amongst local communities to minimise habitat loss and alteration (4).

Colibrí de Juan Fernández,Juan Fernández firecrown ,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Apodiformes,Trochilidae,Sephanoides (1),Male length: 11.5 - 12 cm (2)Female length: c. 10.5 cm (2)Male weight: 10.9 g (2)Female weight: 6.8 g (2),Population numbers of the Juan Fern\xe1ndez firecrown are thought to be in the low hundreds (1) and theJuan Fern\xe1ndez Islands are among the 11 most seriously threatened natural areas in the world as a result of hundreds of years of habitat degradation and the introduction of exotic species (4). Repeated burning deforestation and the introduction of animals and plants and consequently disease have resulted in 75 percent of the <strong>endemic</strong> <strong>vascular flora</strong> being on the verge of extinction (7). This together with the introduction of rabbits and goats has reduced vegetation cover and increased erosion so that now more than 15 percent of the island is severely eroded and lacking vegetation (6). The introduced species that are of specific concern for the Juan Fern\xe1ndez firecrown include rats dogs pigs semi-feral cattle rabbits which have severely affected the low elevation flora including some hummingbird nectar plants; coatis and bramble. Coatis thrive throughout both lowland and upland areas and are opportunistic foragers feeding on the birds and their eggs; while bramble shades out regenerating forest (6) and bears flowers too small for the Juan Fern\xe1ndez firecrown to feed on (2). Due to these changes in habitat the green-backed firecrown (<i>Sephanoides sephanoides</i>) which can feed on brambleis increasing in number and is competing with the Juan Fern\xe1ndez firecrown for space. The Juan Fern\xe1ndez firecrown is also less able to protect itself from predation than the green-backed firecrown. In addition to these threats is the steady impact of collection by scientists and private collectors (6).,The Juan Fern\xe1ndez Islands were designated a national park in 1935 (although not actively protected until 1967) and a biosphere reserve in 1977. The Chilean government began a recovery project in 1997 to restore natural habitat and the islands have since been nominated for World Heritage listing (5). The World Conservation Union (IUCN) has recommended that the population of the Juan Fern\xe1ndez firecrown is monitored that all introduced mammals are removed introduced plant populations are controlled native flora is replanted and that grazing restrictions are enforced within the national park (5). This beautiful little bird is at great threat of extinction because of the dangerously low numbers in the single remaining population. Conservation measures need to be taken immediately to protect the native habitat on the Juan Fern\xe1ndez Islands and in particular to control bramble and coati numbers if this hummingbird is to survive (6).

Animalia,Junín grebe ,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Podicipediformes,Podicipedidae,Podiceps (1),Length: 33 – 38 cm (2),Being restricted to only one lake makes the Junin grebe extremely vulnerable to any changes in the lake. Changes to Lake Junin have resulted in the decline of the grebe from over 1000 in 1961 to probably around 200 individuals in 2007 (5) (7). In addition to this general decline population numbers also fluctuate according to the water level of the lake (7). The Upamayo Dam as part of a hydro-electric plant regulates the water level of Lake Junin creating fluctuations in the water level that can cause nearly half the lake\u2019s surface to dry up including important nesting and foraging areas for the grebes (3) (6) (8). As no young are raised when water levels are very low this regulation has a significant negative impact on the Junin grebe. However the greatest threat it faces and what will ultimately lead to its extinction if not halted is pollution of the lake from mining waste. Waste waters from surrounding mines in the area enter the lake causing water pollution and an accumulation of iron oxides in the lake sediments. The sedimentation of iron oxides causes large parts of the lake bottom to become lifeless and therefore much of the offshore area is no longer adequate feeding habitat (3) (9).,Lake Junin was designated a National Reserve in 1974 which has limited hunting and fishing in the lake but has had no affect on the primary threats of mining and dam-building activities (5). In 1999 Lake Junin was declared to be in a state of emergency resulting in the formation of a committee which implemented an environmental management plan (8). This involves further protection of the lake restrictions on the extraction of water and provisions for its cleaning (5). However much work is still required to prevent further pollution of the lake and restore the habitat. Continuing pollution will inevitably lead to the extinction of the Junin grebe unless a \u201creserve\u201d population is established in another location. <strong>Translocation</strong> of the Junin grebe to a lake north of Lake Junin was attempted but unfortunately the use of gill-nets to fish trout in this lake made it unsuitable (7). In 1997 the IUCN Grebe Specialist Group created a Global Conservation Strategy to ensure the successful recovery of grebe populations and the management of wetlands (9). Particular conservation actions recommended for this species include carrying out studies of other lakes to identify suitable locations for further <strong>translocation</strong> attempts as well as taking steps to prevent pollutants from entering Lake Junin and to de-toxify lake sediments (9).

owl parrot,Kakapo ,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Psittaciformes,Psittacidae,Strigops (1),950 - 4,000 g (3),The first human settlers of New Zealand were the Maori who hunted kakapo for their feathers and meat; the Polynesian dog and rat introduced by the Maori also preyed upon this species (5). When Europeans began to settle in the 1800s the range of the kakapo had already dramatically declined and the situation became critical as Europeans set about clearing forests hunting and releasing mammalian predators such as domestic cats dogs stoats and rats. The kakapo is particularly vulnerable to predation by mammals due to its strong scent habit of freezing when threatened and especially its ground nesting behaviour (5) and flightlessness; the latter together with very slow breeding strategies are key elements in the demise of many endangered and extinct New Zealand species (8). Introduced possums and deer compete with the kakapo for food sources (5).,The drastic measure of removing all surviving kakapo to predator-free islands has averted extinction of this remarkable bird. There is a National Kakapo Team and a ten-year Recovery Plan for the species (5). Measures to conserve the kakapo include intensive invasive management of free-living individuals including supplementary feeding in order to stimulate and support breeding and measures to improve the survival of chicks. Although research and management are ongoing the dedication and hard work have paid off and initial results are very encouraging; the kakapo population has increased from 51 individuals in 1995 to 86 in 2002 (3). Unfortunately in July 2004 three young female kakapos died as the result of a mystery infection taking the total population down to 83 individuals. New Zealand's Department of Conservation was quick to respond giving the remaining kakapos antibiotics (9). A productive year in 2009 saw the kakapo population increase to 124 individuals (10) although the loss of a male in February 2010 brought the total down to 123 (5). In January 2012 the kakapo population stood at 127 individuals (11).

In Arizona high water discharges from the Glen Canyon Dam situated upriver from the Grand Canyon National Park results in snails being swept downstream and the loss of suitable habitat (2) while in Utah the Kanab amber snail population is at risk due to the alteration of its habitat by a private landowner (2) (3).,The Arizona Game and Fish Department and the National Park Service have attempted to establish a new wild population of Kanab amber snails in Grand Canyon National Park. In September 1998 snails were taken from Vasey\u2019s Paradise and introduced to three natural springs in areas which would not be affected by dam operations. Further individuals were <strong>translocated</strong> in July 1999 to boost population densities and improve <strong>genetic variation</strong>. Since that initial stocking in 1998 a population seems to have established at one site the Upper Elves Chasm (3). It is hoped that the successful establishment of this additional wild Kanab amber snail population in Arizona will greatly aid in the conservation of this rare species (3).

Atlantic ridley turtle,Kemp’s ridley turtle ,Animalia,Chordata,Reptilia,Testudines,Cheloniidae,Lepidochelys (1),27 – 40 kg (2),Kemp\u2019s ridley turtle suffered a dramatic decline during the 1950s - 60s due mainly to the over harvesting of eggs natural predation and mortality caused by trawl fisheries (6). Because nesting occurs in such large concentrations with shallow poorly disguised nests eggs are easily exploited by human collectors (by whom they are valued for their aphrodisiac properties) and by natural predators such as coyotes (5). Today the main threat to the survival of the species comes from shrimp trawlers which often operate in areas where turtles feed turtles accidentally caught in nets (<strong>by-catch</strong>) drown to death and it is estimated that between 500 to 5000 turtles are killed in this way each year (6).,International trade in Kemp\u2019s ridley turtles and products is banned under their listing on Appendix I of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) and the main nesting beach has been declared a National Reserve since the 1970s (5). During the breeding season nests are protected by armed patrols and subsequently very little illegal trade occurs (2). Turtle Excluding Devices (TEDs) fitted to shrimp nets can help to prevent <strong>by-catch</strong> by allowing only shrimp-sized objects to enter the net (6). There has been an international drive to introduce these devices worldwide and shrimp trawlers operating in United States waters must now be fitted with TEDs (6). These conservation efforts have led to the slow recovery of Kemp\u2019s ridley turtle numbers and it has been suggested that a population goal of 10000 nesting females could be reached by 2010 (2) allowing arribadas to once again adorn the Mexican coast.

montane dancing-jewel,Kenya dancing-jewel ,Animalia,Arthropoda,Insecta,Odonata,Chlorocyphidae,Platycypha (1),Platycypha (1),Classified as Critically Endangered on the IUCN Red List this tiny animal is becoming increasingly threatened by extensive habitat loss and degradation within its range. Forest has largely been cleared between the altitudes at which the species occurs leaving only fragmented and small secondary forest pockets.

A Darwin Initiative Project has undertaken conservation work in the British Virgin Islands and recommendations for preserving the islands\u2019 plant species include seed collection monitoring programmes and introducing plants into cultivation. It will also be important to raise public awareness about the value of the region\u2019s unique flora and its conservation (6).

Logging charcoal-making hunting and unmanaged resource extraction are common in the Rungwe-Livingstone forests (1) (4). The narrow forest corridors linking Mt Rungwe to Livingstone and joining the northern and southern sections of Livingstone are all highly degraded. Fragmentation of the remaining forests threatens to split the population into three smaller isolated subpopulations (4). While the monkey\u2019s total known range at Rungwe-Livingstone is around 70 km\xb2 at Ndundulu it is just 3 km\xb2 (1). The kipunji is one of the three threatened monkey species identified in the Udzungwa Mountains a testament to the biologically rich but fragile ecosystems of the region (5).,The kipunji occurs in the Kitulo National Park on Mount Rungwe which should help protect the small Livingstone Forest population there but swift action is needed to also preserve the connecting forest corridors. Although the forests of Ndundulu are in excellent condition the population is small and outside of the Udzungwa Mountains National Park in the adjacent unprotected Ndundulu Forest Reserve. This has prompted calls for the area to be better protected by expanding the boundaries of Udzungwa Mountains National Park westward to include all of the Ndundulu Forest (1). Indeed the Udzungwa Mountains represent an amazing biodiversity \u2018hotspot\u2019 and this incredible discovery of a third threatened monkey species affirms its status as one of the most important regions for primate conservation in Africa (5). One can only hope that the excitement and publicity of new scientific finds such as this will highlight the need to increase our conservation efforts. Without prompt action the future of this rare and remarkable monkey remains highly uncertain (4) (5).

The threats to Kittlitz\u2019s murrelet are numerous and significant including habitat loss and degradation possibly as a result of global warming; disturbance and degradation of habitat as a result of boat traffic in summer feeding areas; drowning in gillnet fisheries; and oil spills (4) (5).   Between 7 and 15 percent of the murrelet population inhabiting Prince William Sound Alaska died as a result of the Exxon Valdez oil spill in 1989 (5) one of the most publicized environmental tragedies in history (7).,Considered globally by IUCN to be Critically Endangered (1) Kittlitz\u2019s murrelet is listed in the Red Data Book of Russia (4) but is not currently protected in the USA where there is currently believed to be insufficient data to determine its status (5).  However guidelines to avoid the disturbance of nesting birds have been drawn up in the USA (5).  Given the evidence that shows Kittlitz\u2019s murrelet is on a path towards extinction its protection in the USA under the Endangered Species Act is believed to be essential (5) (6) along with the protection of critical habitat which would help guard this species from the threats of fishing tourism and industrial boat traffic (6).

The bones were recovered and sent to the University of Kansas\u2019 Museum of Natural History but were not examined until 1982 (8).  The only significant scientific observation of the kouprey was made in 1957 when zoologist Charles Wharton studied and filmed the animal in the wild (9).  By 1970 it was thought to be extinct following continued hunting for meat and for their horns and skulls for use in traditional Chinese medicine (1) (7).  It has not been seen alive since 1988 despite aerial surveys in Cambodia in 1994 and subsequent ground surveys in Cambodia Lao PDR and Vietnam (1).  However tracks have been spotted and horns and skulls are still found for sale in Southeast Asia leading many to believe that some koupreys still exist (5) (7).  In addition to hunting habitat loss as a result of agriculture and logging activity is likely to have significantly impacted the kouprey and domestic livestock in the area could have introduced disease into the kouprey population.  Land mines along the borders of Cambodia may also be responsible for kouprey deaths and certainly hinder conservation efforts (1).,The kouprey is legally protected in all range states and may be present in some protected areas.  Prince Sihanouk designated it as the national animal of Cambodia in the 1960s partly due to its mystique (5).  Large mammal surveys continue to take place in Cambodia hoping to re-discover living kouprey. There are no kouprey in animal collections so captive breeding is not currently possible (1).

Due to the small fragmented nature of the remaining La Gomera giant lizard population it also at risk from chance natural events such as rock falls (1).,The remaining population of the La Gomera giant lizard is thought to number only around 90 wild individuals (1). This species is currently protected by international legislation and the majority of its range occurs within the protected rural park of Valle Gran Rey (1) (7).

Animalia,La Palma giant lizard ,Animalia,Chordata,Reptilia,Squamata,Lacertidae,Gallotia (1),Snout-vent length: up to 44 cm (2),The decline in the La Palma giant lizard population is believed to be mainly due to the arrival of humans to the Canary Islands (1) (2). As well as using this species as a source of food humans also introduced other predators of the La Palma giant lizard including cats and dogs (1) (2).,The La Palma giant lizard is believed to be potentially extinct with a sighting of this species in 2007 remaining unconfirmed (5) (6). If this species does still survive the remaining population is likely to be extremely small totalling less than 50 mature individuals. It is not known if this species occurs in any protected areas (1).

Animalia,Largetooth sawfish ,Animalia,Chordata,Chondrichthyes,Rajiformes,Pristidae,Pristis (1),c. 500 kg (3),Once common in the Mediterranean and the Eastern Atlantic the largetooth sawfish has now been <strong>extirpated</strong> from the Mediterranean and European waters and populations in Africa are believed to be severely depleted (2). Similarly in Lake Nicaragua where this species used to be abundant the largetooth sawfish barely continues to exist (3). These distressing declines have been largely due to over-fishing and the degradation of important estuarine and freshwater habitats (5). The largetooth sawfish is hunted for its unique and peculiar blade-like snout fins and meat. It is also captured for public aquaria where it is highly prized for exhibits (5). Incidental capture in fisheries also poses a significant threat as its toothed saw makes this fish especially prone to getting entangled in fishing nets (2) (5). Characteristics of the sawfish\u2019s life history such as slow growth rate poor rate of reproduction and high age of maturity make the largetooth sawfish extremely vulnerable to over-exploitation and unable to easily recover from low numbers (5).,The largetooth sawfish is listed on Appendix I of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) meaning that international trade in this species is prohibited except in exceptional circumstances (4). Besides this listing there are currently no conservation measures in place for this species and it is believed that without urgent intervention there is a high probability that the largetooth sawfish will become extinct (2).

Laysan teal,Laysan duck ,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Anseriformes,Anatidae,Anas (1),Length: 41 cm (2),The limited range and small single population of the Laysan duck is the greatest ultimate threat to this species\u2019 survival at present as it makes it is extremely vulnerable to chance events such as disease or severe weather (4).  Introduced species are a potential threat to the species persistence; while mammalian predators are not currently a problem on Laysan Island there is nothing to prevent an accidental introduction and there are no measures in place to deal with the event should it occur (6).  Many non-native <strong>invertebrates</strong> have arrived on Laysan and while not all are impacting the Laysan duck some (such as ants) are possibly affecting the Laysan duck\u2019s food supply as they compete for their terrestrial prey (4).  An introduced grass <i>Cenchrus echinatus</i> encroached on the native bunchgrass (<i>Eragrostis variabilis</i>) on Laysan Island reducing important breeding habitat but this noxious weed was thankfully eradicated from the island (13).  Infection with the parasitic nematode worm <i>Echinuria uncinata</i> is causing problems for the Laysan duck\u2019s precariously small population (2) and global sea level rise poses a constant threat to all species on the low-lying island of Laysan (4).,The Laysan duck is listed under Appendix I of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) and so international trade in this species is under tight control (3). Furthermore Laysan Island and Midway Atoll are under the protection of the United States Fish and Wildlife Service as they are both National Wildlife Refuges (14) and whilst there are no measures to prevent an accidental species introduction (for example via a ship wreck or unauthorised landing) Laysan Island has a quarantine for authorised visitors (6).  Conservation action that has taken place to date includes the eradication of the introduced grass <i>Cenchrus echinatus</i> (13) as well as the control of other alien plant species that threaten Laysan\u2019s wetlands (<i>Pluchea indica</i>) on Laysan Island and the successful <strong>translocation</strong> of wild Laysan Ducks to Midway Atoll National Wildlife Refuge.  The translocated ducks have bred successfully creating an \u2018insurance\u2019 population which will reduce the chances of a catastrophic event wiping out the entire species since it is unlikely that a disaster would strike two islands simultaneously (15).

leaf-scaled seasnake,Leaf-scaled sea snake ,Animalia,Chordata,Reptilia,Squamata,Elapidae,Aipysurus (1),up to 500 g (3),In the 1990s the leaf-scaled sea snake used to comprise about 50 percent of the sea snakes commonly recorded on its native <strong>reef flats</strong> with its population numbers estimated at between 4000 and 9000. However intensive surveys have failed to record a single individual since 2001 (1).,The leaf-scaled sea snake used to be the most common sea snake species encountered on the <strong>reef flat</strong> at Ashmore Reef (2). However despite it being a nature reserve since 1983 (1) sightings in this particular area have not been reported since 2001 (2). Illegal fishing on the reef has been monitored at various levels since 1983 although protection of marine life in the area was not actively enforced until 1998. Unfortunately none of the implemented habitat management plans are specifically targeted towards conserving the leaf-scaled sea snake and it is unclear how or to what extent these measures are reducing the current threats to this species (1).

leatherback, leathery turtle, luth, trunkback turtle,Leatherback turtle ,Animalia,Chordata,Reptilia,Testudines,Dermochelyidae,Dermochelys (1),300 - 600 kg (average female) (2),Perhaps the greatest threat to the leatherback turtle is global climate change. This is expected to affect this species through habitat loss physiological changes and loss of prey (13).\xa0,The leatherback turtle is protected throughout most of its range (1) and international trade in the leatherback turtle and products is banned under Appendix I of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) (3). Many conservation projects have been set up on leatherback turtle nesting beaches with specific management protocols tailored to each location. The attachment of Turtle Excluding Devices (TEDs) to shrimp nets can help prevent the accidental capture of turtles (<strong>bycatch</strong>) and the US government has recently set up Leatherback Conservation Areas in the north Pacific that are off-limits to long-line fisheries during certain times of the year (12).\xa0

Plantae,Lepinia ,Plantae,Tracheophyta,Magnoliopsida,Gentianales,Apocynaceae,Lepinia (1),Height: 2 - 10 m (2),The single greatest threat to the native flora of the Polynesian Islands is invasive alien plants (4). In Tahiti in particular the invasive South American tree <i>Miconia calvescens</i> has displaced as much as 70 percent of the island\u2019s native vegetation (5). The dense stands formed by this vigorous species severely limit the regenerative ability of the smaller understorey plants by preventing their seedlings from receiving sufficient sunlight. It is reported that in forest dominated by <i>Miconia calvescens </i>on Tahiti seedlings comprise only 7 percent of the <i>Lepenia taitensis</i> population compared with 60 percent in intact native forest on Moorea (4).,As a direct threat to the survival of a large number of French Polynesia\u2019s endemic plants (4) considerable effort is being made to develop an efficient means of controlling the spread of <i>Miconia calvescens</i> (5). Thus far a biological control programme initiated in Tahiti in 2000 has been of limited success (5).

Sidamo bushlark, Sidamo lark, Sidamo long-clawed lark,Liben lark ,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Alaudidae,Heteromirafra (1),30 g (2),Its occurrence in just one small region in which there are no protected areas (2) makes the\xa0Liben lark highly vulnerable to any threats. Currently the greatest threat appears to be the loss of its habitat. As human populations in the region rise largely due to the immigration of people from nearby areas hit by drought or tribal conflict more land is converted to permanent agriculture (4) destroying the grassland required by the lark. Between 1973 and 2002 suitable grassland habitat in the area declined by about 30 percent and in recent years more has been lost to the rapid encroachment of shrubs (4). Excessive grazing pressure and the suppression of natural seasonal fires has created favourable conditions for the encroaching shrubs (4). Finally a watering point has been developed in the centre of the Liben lark\u2019s range leading to an increase in livestock in the area which impacts the Liben lark through disturbance overgrazing and trampling (4).,In 2007 an expedition took place to investigate the status of the\xa0Liben lark (4) but otherwise conservation action for this Critically Endangered bird is lacking. A number of conservation measures have been recommended by the global bird conservation organisation BirdLife including further surveys and research investigations to determine what causes bushes to encroach on grassland and ascertaining the best way to protect areas of the Liben lark\u2019s habitat from further degradation and disturbance (4). In 2009 the IUCN upgraded the Liben lark from Endangered to Critically Endangered in light of the threats to the tiny population and it is feared that there is a real possibility of the species becoming extinct in the next few years (4).

This species has suffered from habitat destruction and from competition with invasive introduced species such as <i>Rhodomyrtus</i> spp. and <i>Psidium</i> spp. (4). In 1992 Hurricane Iniki swept through the area and destroyed yet more of the remaining plants (1). Today the biggest threat to the survival of the 4 remaining trees comes from seed predation by rats pigs or humans (1).,<i>Pritchardia viscosa</i> is listed as Endangered throughout its range by the U.S. Fish &amp; Wildlife Service and as such is featured on a Recovery Plan for the Kauai Plant Cluster which was developed in 1995 (5).

In 2000 the population in the Amani Nature Reserve in the East Usambaras was estimated at just 150 to 200 (4) although more recent work suggests this may be a slight underestimate (7). The population in Nilo Nature Reserve East Usambara Mountains which was initially discovered in 1996 (9) is currently being investigated and preliminary data suggest that the entire East Usambara population will be higher than previously thought (12). The population of the Njesi Plateau in Mozambique is unknown but is likely to be small (2) (3) (6).\xa0,A number of conservation efforts are underway in the East Usambaras where the long-billed tailorbird currently occurs in at least two protected areas the Amani Nature Reserve and the Nilo Nature Reserve (2) (3) (9) (11). Projects are underway to increase the amount of forest in protected areas and the Amani Nature Reserve in particular has an active conservation programme (3) (5). Additional conservation actions for the species include a population monitoring programme extensive field surveys educational programmes and the recording and monitoring of every known tailorbird <strong>territory</strong> (3). These conservation initiatives are being conducted by the Wildlife Conservation Society of Tanzania a BirdLife partner in close collaboration with the management of Amani and Nilo Nature Reserves and other stakeholders (12).\xa0

At that time chinchilla populations were flourishing but their pelts were the most valuable in the world reaching up to $100000 for one alone and soon they faced extinction in the wild (5). There are currently an estimated 10000 individuals left in the Chilean mountains (6) (7). More recently populations have also suffered due to habitat destruction by the burning and harvesting of the algarobilla shrub at lower altitudes (7).,Chinchilla are protected by law in their natural habitat but it is extremely hard to monitor hunting in the remote mountain ranges of the Andes and illegal hunting does continue in some areas (6) (7). For the same reason it is also difficult to monitor the population. Recent estimates suggest this species is becoming more isolated following habitat loss and therefore less likely to be able to recover without human intervention. Reintroductions have not worked in the past though breeding is still successful in captivity and hundreds of chinchilla are bred commercially for the pet trade (2). It is hoped that conservation measures will be applied successfully to protect this species and bring it back from the brink of extinction in the wild (5).

Madagascar side-necked turtle,Madagascar big-headed turtle ,Animalia,Chordata,Reptilia,Testudines,Podocnemididae,Erymnochelys (1),Length: 50 cm (2),This species is heavily exploited for food in Madagascar where it is easily caught in nets fish traps and by hook and line (8). It is also caught and exported illegally from Madagascar to Asia for the traditional medicine market. Furthermore land development on Madagascar is a serious threat to this turtle as it destroys its natural habitats. Clearing forests for agriculture and timber opens up Madagascar\u2019s untouched habitat and leads to terrible erosion. Subsequent siltation of rivers and lakes renders the turtles even more susceptible to trapping (5).,The Madagascar big-headed turtle is protected from international trade by its listing on Appendix II of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) (3). In May 2003 the Turtle Conservation Fund (TCF) released the first ever list of the world\u2019s top 25 endangered turtles which included the Madagascar big-headed turtle (5). The TCF intends to cover a five year \u2018Global Action Plan\u2019 that includes captive breeding and reintroduction projects trade monitoring and establishment of rescue centres local conservation plans and educational programs (5). The Durrell Wildlife Conservation Trust is also independently involved in the conservation and protection of this species (9). It is hoped that these measures will provide the protection that this species needs to survive in its natural habitat.

Pygargue de Madagascar, Pygargue malgache,Madagascar fish-eagle ,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Falconiformes,Accipitridae,Haliaeetus (1),Male weight: 2.2 - 2.6 kg (2) (3)Female weight: 2.8 - 3.5 kg (2) (3),It has been widely accepted that the Madagascar fish-eagle suffered a drastic population decline during the mid-20th Century (4) although recent genetic research suggests that the population has always been naturally small (3). However the species' small population size and fragmented distribution still leaves it vulnerable to extinction risks. Potential threats to the species' survival include habitat degradation and direct and indirect human persecution (9). Additionally the effects of behavioural traits such as poor juvenile dispersal (13) and incestuous matings (2) (14) may lead to problems of <strong>inbreeding depression</strong> (3).,The Madagascar fish-eagle is protected by its listing on Appendix II of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) (5). In 1998 Madagascar became a signatory to the International Ramsar Convention on Wetlands and a complex of four lakes in the Antsalova region were designated as a site of Wetlands of International Importance (15). These sites (known as the Manambolomaty Complex) support\xa0ten percent\xa0of the world population of Madagascar fish-eagles (9). In addition the Peregrine Fund has initiated a Madagascar Fish Eagle Conservation Programme (16) enabling detailed studies of this species as well as the initiation of a sustainability project for the local people who share their natural resources with the fish-eagles.

The last observation at Alaotra was in 1960 and the last anywhere in 1970 until in 1991 a lone male was captured at Alaotra (11) and kept in captivity until its death a year later (2) (3) (4) (5) (7) (9). Intensive searches and publicity campaigns during the 1990s failed to find any more birds (4) (7) (9) and the Madagascar pochard was feared extinct until the rediscovery of 25 individuals at a new site in 2006 (4) (7).,Lake Alaotra was declared a Ramsar Wetland of International Importance in 2003 (15) and efforts have been underway at the site to conserve and restore the last remnants of unmodified habitat which should also benefit other threatened species. Other conservation measures have included education and awareness programmes involving local communities in environmental monitoring and continuing the search for any remaining Madagascar pochards. However the region\u2019s huge economic importance for agriculture and fisheries can make implementing conservation policies difficult (7) (12). It may also be important to establish reserves and prohibit hunting in the area (2) (9).

No specific conservation measures are known to be in place for the major black millipede and despite having an important role in ecosystems as nutrient recyclers (5) <strong>invertebrates</strong> such as millipedes tend to be overlooked in conservation policies (2) (7)\xa0with less than half of South Africa\u2019s <strong>invertebrates</strong> even officially named (2). Some efforts are underway to collate information on these species such as the Green Trust Database of Threatened South African Invertebrates (2) and such initiatives will be important in improving the conservation of species such as this little-known millipede (1).

It has a restricted range and therefore is vulnerable to habitat degradation from nearby quarrying activities. It is also known to be at risk from human disturbance particularly where it grows in more accessible areas (1) (2).,The Maltese rock-centaury is legally protected by its listing on the EC Habitats Directive as a priority species affording this species some protection (1) (3). The cliffs of Malta and some on Gozo are protected locally with access only granted for scientific purposes (2). Fungus Rock is protected as a nature reserve (2). This species has also been cultivated therefore providing a stock for potential future reintroduction (2).

Animalia,Mangrove finch ,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Emberizidae,Camarhynchus (1),18 g (3),With a declining population of less than 100 adult birds (3) and a breeding range of around one square kilometre (5) the mangrove finch\u2019s situation is critical. The exact cause of this species\u2019 decline is unclear but natural factors such as the <strong>El Ni\xf1o</strong> cycle introduced species and human activities may all be involved (2). As a result of introduced predators such as black rats cats and the smooth-billed ani preying on eggs and chicks and high levels of nest infestation by the blood sucking parasite <i>Philornis downsi</i> causing the death of nestlings the mangrove finch\u2019s breeding success is low (2). Concerted conservation action is necessary if this species is to be saved from extinction.,For over a decade the Charles Darwin Foundation (CDF) has been working to conserve the mangrove finch (2). At present extensive research is being conducted to better understand this species\u2019 breeding biology and to determine the causes of its decline (2) (5). In the meantime active protection of the remaining breeding populations is being employed through predator and nest parasite control (5). Despite these measures the mangrove finch remains extremely vulnerable due to its limited range. In order to address this the CDF and the Durrell Wildlife Conservation Trust are currently working together towards a captive breeding and <strong>translocation</strong> programme. If successful their efforts will help to ensure a future for this remarkable species (5) (7).

Plantae,Many-fruited beardless moss ,Plantae,Bryophyta,Bryopsida,Pottiales,Pottiaceae,Weissia,Height: up to 15 mm,The moss is at risk from several factors. The most threatening is the use of chemicals and fertilisers on arable farmland. The moss risks being 'crowded out' by competing grasses and other larger plants from over enrichment of the soil. <i>Weissia multicapsularis</i> also requires bare ground with the right conditions on which to establish and if this is not available within the range of its spores the moss cannot establish a new colony. Why it fails to <strong>germinate</strong> on some apparently suitable sites is something we know very little about.,The status of this moss is giving conservationists cause for grave concern. Apart from France this moss has only ever been recorded in Britain. As the French population was destroyed by construction work on the only known site in 1997 this species may well be at severe risk of global extinction. <i>Weissia multicapsularis</i> is listed in the UK Biodiversity Action Plans and is one of the threatened mosses on English Nature's Species Recovery Programme. Efforts to save the moss have concentrated on management of the three sites where there are still reasonable sized populations. The work involves maintaining a suitable habitat for the moss including clearing scrub and large over-shading vegetation and weeding by hand around some the bank-top colonies.

aga, Guam crow,Mariana crow ,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Corvidae,Corvus (1),Length: 38 cm (2),The principal cause of the Mariana crow\u2019s decline on Guam has been predation by the introduced brown tree snake <i>Boiga irregularis</i>. Despite protection of nest sites this has resulted in the near complete extirpation of the species with the exception of a small number of introduced specimens (2). On Rota this species has been seriously affected by a number of threats including: forest clearance for homestead and agricultural development; direct persecution; nest predation by introduced rats and monitor lizards; competition with the introduced bird species <i>Dicrurus macrocercus</i>; and disease (2). In addition recent typhoons have destroyed large areas of forest habitat on Rota and records indicate that brown tree snake individuals have been introduced to the island (1). If the snake establishes a population it is likely to have a catastrophic effect on the Mariana crow\u2019s dwindling population potentially driving it to extinction (1) (2).,The Mariana crow is listed by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service as an endangered species and several conservation measures are in place to preserve its imperilled island populations (2) (5). At present one of the main priorities for the preservation of the Mariana crow is to research and reduce the threat posed by the brown treesnake on both islands including the prevention of further spread to Rota (5). In 1993 a National Wildlife Refuge was established on Guam to preserve the remaining forest and a 40 hectare snake-free area has been created for the introduction of Mariana crows. On Rota a predation control experiment is to be initiated and there are plans to extend the coverage of the island\u2019s protected areas under the Habitat Conservation Plan for Rota's Agricultural Homesteads (1) (2). In addition to the implementation of measures to reduce the brown treesnake population and to protect remaining habitat it is essential that further research is carried out to assess the population status of the Mariana crow on Rota. This includes detailed research into the relative importance of different factors affecting the species\u2019 survival and reproduction (5).

Másafuera Rayadito,Masafuera rayadito ,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Furnariidae,Aphrastura (1),Body length: 16 cm (2),Introduced mammals are the biggest threat to this species causing damage to its sheltered habitats and increasing predation. Goats and rabbits brought to the island the Juan Fern\xe1ndez archipelago graze and trample vegetation creating large areas that are dangerously exposed for the birds (5). Introduced rats mice and feral cats all probably prey on this species posing a threat to the eggs chicks and adults (2). The only native predator of the Masafuera rayadito on Alejandro Selkirk the red-backed (or Masafuera) hawk (<em>Buteo polyosoma</em>) has increased in numbers since hunting it became illegal and following an increase of introduced mice and rats on which it can feed (6).,Despite recognition of the Juan Fern\xe1ndez Islands as an important area for wildlife (they are now a National Park and Endemic Bird Area) (5) population numbers of the Masafuera rayadito may still be declining. Conservation measures have included removing sheep from the island in 1983 and sporadic goat control programmes from 1998 until 2003. Proposed measures prioritise the eradication of introduced mammal species including goats rats and cats (2) (3) and this must be followed by preventing the introduction of any new alien species (5). Increased monitoring and understanding of the ecology and threats to this bird will improve conservation efforts and comparisons with related species such as the thorn-tailed rayadito (<em>Aphrastura spinicauda</em>) and other <strong>endemic</strong> species of the archipelago may help (2) (3).

Kiwikiu,Maui parrotbill ,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Drepanididae,Pseudonestor (1),Length: 14 cm (2),Already restricted to higher elevations because of mosquito-borne diseases at lower elevations the Maui parrotbill is further excluded from the highest elevations due to habitat destruction and is therefore limited to a very small range (7). Although it occupies all suitable areas it has a low population density with the total population currently numbering just 500 individuals (4). The population density is thought to be constrained by food availability which has been reduced as a result of the habitat damage caused by feral pigs. Habitat degradation elsewhere appears to exacerbate the effects of heavy rainfall which may have an effect on nest failure (7).,The Hawaiian Division of Forestry and Wildlife implemented a five year recovery plan for the Maui parrotbill in 2003 which aims to protect existing habitat continue research into the ecology of the species and the threats it faces restore potential habitat and run a captive breeding programme for release of Maui parrotbills into this newly restored habitat (7).

Zosterops chloronothos,Mauritius olive white-eye ,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Zosteropidae,Zosterops (1),Length: 10 cm (2),Like many native species on Mauritius the Mauritius olive white-eye has been badly affected by habitat loss and by predation by introduced mammals. The species has a very small range and its habitat is continuing to decline in extent and quality compounding the major threat of nest predation. As a result the Mauritius olive white-eye population has declined drastically since the mid-1970s from around 350 pairs to only 100 or so in 2001 (2) (3) (6). In addition the extremely low reproductive success recorded in recent years is of critical concern (7). With such a small population the species is also particularly vulnerable to extinction from extreme events such as cyclones.,The Mauritius olive white-eye is protected by law and part of its range occurs within the Black River National Park. There are also plans to purchase habitat around Bassin Blanc (2). In 2005 a species recovery programme was initiated by the Mauritian Wildlife Foundation with the aim of increasing knowledge of the Mauritius olive white-eye and its threats and to investigate management techniques. Since then an intensive management plan has been applied to the species involving monitoring of the wild population undertaking predator control at nest sites rescue and harvest of wild nests artificial incubation and hand-rearing of offspring. However it is thought that effective habitat management and releases onto predator-free islets are more viable options than captive breeding (2) (6).

McCord’s box turtle,Mccord’s box turtle ,Animalia,Chordata,Reptilia,Testudines,Bataguridae,Cuora (1),Maximum carapace length: 13.4 – 16.5 cm (2),Like many of Asia\u2019s turtle species Mccord\u2019s box turtles are dangerously close to extinction because they are being over exploited by the Asian turtle trade for meat and traditional medicine (4). In addition the turtle has suffered from capture for the western pet market and from habitat loss and degradation. The species has become increasingly scarce within the Chinese food markets indicating that populations in the wild are declining. Furthermore the extremely high prices paid in the western pet market by turtle enthusiasts with individuals reaching up to US$ 2000 signifies the rarity and difficulty of obtaining these animals (2). It has been estimated that perhaps no more than 350 specimens remain possibly considerably fewer all within private or zoo collections (6). Although no direct studies have been made it is assumed that this species\u2019 habitat must have been drastically affected by the large-scale deforestation experienced within southwest China. Additionally pollution is a major problem in the area\u2019s waterways. Indeed the China Environment Report ranks China as the highest producer of sulphur dioxide in the world with Guangxi and Guangdong belonging to the areas most affected by acid rain (2).,As a native Chinese species Mccord\u2019s box turtle is protected by the Wildlife Protection Law of 1988 which requires that capture transport and trade in wild animals is by official permit only. China\u2019s National Environmental Protection Agency (1998) has recommended that the species be listed as \u2018major protected wildlife\u2019 in order to prohibit capture and trade completely. This would help the survival of this critically endangered turtle but only if such laws could viably be enforced something that is notoriously difficult. Over 51 nature reserves and two \u2018scenic areas\u2019 have been established in Guangxi where Mccord\u2019s box turtle may occur but quantitative surveys of the species\u2019 population size and distribution are needed to better determine the benefits of these protected areas for the species (2). The current outlook for Mccord\u2019s box turtle in the wild is pretty grim but the species\u2019 prospects for continuing survival are nevertheless hopeful largely due to its ability to adapt well to captivity and successfully reproduce (6). However there have been no plans for releasing captive-bred individuals into the wild and until the current climate of the Asian turtle trade western pet market and ongoing habitat destruction change it would seem unsafe to do so. Until such time captive-bred individuals can serve to buffer against total extinction but nevertheless remain a poor substitute for a self-sustainable population in the wild where this turtle belongs.

Phoque-moine Méditerranéen,Mediterranean monk seal ,Animalia,Chordata,Mammalia,Carnivora,Phocidae,Monachus (1),Length of male: 240 cm (2)Length of female: 238 cm (2)Weight of male: 315 kg (2)Weight of female: 300 kg (2),Mediterranean monk seals are highly sensitive to disturbance and humans have extensively used both the sea and beaches of their habitat for centuries causing the population to collapse (2). The main threats facing this species are deliberate killing by fishermen who perceive the species as a competitor for fish entanglement in fishing gear disturbance and habitat loss through development and tourism disease and the effects of toxic algal blooms (2). In 1997 two thirds of the seals in the largest population located at Cap Blanc Mauritania were lost due to the accumulation of toxins in fish following an algal bloom (5) (10). These shy creatures have taken to hauling out in caves to give birth rather than on developed beaches and the collapse of such caves is a further threat to the survival of the species (2).,The IUCN Species Survival Commission Seal Specialist Group has devised an Action Plan for the conservation of the species the aims of which include the involvement of local fishermen research into the status of the species and the development of a captive breeding programme (7). A Greek National Programme for the Protection of the Monk Seal has been established aiming to prevent human-induced mortalities of the species and to restore and maintain a viable self-supporting population (6). Some experts believe that the removal of pups from a population to supply a captive programme could severely affect breeding within the wild population and injure the pups concerned (7). Captive breeding is usually recommended for mammal species of such low numbers as this and with threats continuing in the wild but concerns that removing young seals from the wild will not severely affect breeding in the wild and will not injure or negatively affect survival of the captured young must be adequately addressed (11). It is clear that determined action is urgently required if this reclusive beleaguered species is to escape total extinction.

Animalia,Medium tree-finch ,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Emberizidae,Camarhynchus (1),Length: 12.5 cm (2),The medium tree-finch used to be found on the coast but is now restricted to the highlands (4) as a result of the extensive habitat destruction and degradation on Floreana caused by agriculture and free-ranging livestock. Introduced predators such as cats dogs and rats also pose a threat (2). The introduction of diseases such as avian pox may also potentially threaten finches. A population of the large ground finch has already become extinct on Floreana which illustrates the vulnerability of finch species to such threats.,The majority of the Galapagos archipelago forms part of the Galapagos National Park a World Heritage Site. A management plan is in place for the islands and the Ecuadorian government and non-governmental organisations are working to conserve the unique biodiversity of the Galapagos (5) all of which will help ensure the future of this species. More specifically scientists at the Charles Darwin Research Station are working to improve our understanding of Darwin\u2019s finches to ensure their conservation. This includes monitoring of populations and investigating introduced diseases (3). However in 2009 the IUCN upgraded the medium tree-finch from Vulnerable to Critically Endangered in light of its tiny range on a small island and indications of a rapid decline in the species due to the effects of a parasite <i>Philornis downsi</i> (2).

Not only does this logging result in a reduced area for the macaques to live but it also destabilises the local ecosystem causing water levels in the forest rivers to fluctuate much more extensively than in the past. The alternating flooding and very low water levels has also caused an increase in malarial mosquitoes (7).,The Mentawai Islands are of high conservation significance as they are home to an unusually high number of <strong>endemic</strong> species and <strong>subspecies</strong> (8) and are part of the Sundaland Biodiversity Hotspot (7).  Although 18 percent of the Mentawai Islands lies within three major protected areas (5) unfortunately the Mentawai macaque is not found in any protected area (1).

On Raivave the species\u2019 population is in a critical state while the tiny population on Henderson Island is thought to consist of fewer than six adult plants (1) (6). Like many other floral species on these isolated islands <em>Meryta brachypoda</em> is highly vulnerable to competition for natural resources with introduced exotic species and on Tubai the fruit tree <em>Psidium cattleianum </em>is a particularly problematic non-native species. On Henderson Island natural habitats are threatened by coconut planting and the unsustainable harvesting of certain tree species for timber by neighbouring Pitcairn Islanders (2) (7).,Facing the very real threat of extinction the survival of <em>Meryta brachypoda</em> may be dependant on the implementation of major conservation measures. The development of <strong>ex-situ</strong> conservation measures is deemed a priority for this species while introducing it to new areas of the islands it inhabits is a possibility. Visitors to Henderson Island should also be encouraged to limit coconut planning and measures must be taken to prevent the further introduction of exotic species (2). \xa0

Populations in the remaining small forest patches continue to face intense pressure from deforestation and trapping (2).  In addition the beautifully patterned plumage of the Mindoro bleeding-heart makes it a target for trapping for domestic and export pet trade (2) and it is also hunted for food (3).,The Mindoro bleeding-heart was last recorded in 1991 in Sablayan the largest remaining patch of lowland forest but there have been more recent unconfirmed reports by local people from two other areas (5).  It may be afforded a little protection in the Mount Iglit-Baco National Park and hunting has been prohibited around Mount Malasimbo (3).  Thorough surveys of all these areas are urgently needed to clarify the Mindoro bleeding-heart\u2019s current distribution and if any surviving populations are discovered studies to determine its ecological requirements would help inform conservation actions (3) (5).  The protection of two key sites at which the bleeding-heart is believed to occur Mount Halcon and Lake Naujan is also likely to benefit this critically endangered bird (3).

Autillo de Moheli,Moheli scops-owl ,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Strigiformes,Strigidae,Otus (1),Length: 20 – 22 cm (2),The loss of forest on Moh\xe9li has been severe; in 1995 only five percent of the island still had intact dense humid forest. Underplanting is one of the main problems affecting the remaining forest a process in which food-producing plants such as bananas are planted within forests where they alter the natural vegetation composition and eventually cause the degradation of the forest habitat. Aside from habitat loss specific threats to the Moheli scops-owl are hunting and <strong>invasive</strong> species such as rats which may eat its eggs and compete with it for food. At present the highland region inhabited by the Moheli scops-owl is entirely unprotected. Estimates made in 2000 indicated that this owl\u2019s total population amounted to just 400 individuals therefore even a small-scale adverse event could result in its extinction (2).,There are no conservation measures currently in place for the Moheli scops-owl. However proposals have been made to protect this species by extending the R\xe9serve Marine de Nioumachoua so that it includes the highland forest regions that the owl inhabits. With so little known about this species\u2019 biology there is a requirement for further research so that effective protective measures can be developed. Increasing the awareness of Moh\xe9li\u2019s inhabitants about the existence of the Moheli scops-owl and its rarity would also be beneficial for its conservation (2).

Plantae,Montserrat orchid ,Plantae,Tracheophyta,Liliopsida,Orchidales,Orchidaceae,Epidendrum (1),,Between 1995 and 1997 an active volcano erupted on Montserrat resulting in widespread devastation of the island\u2019s natural landscape. Hot ash gases and rocks destroyed trees blocked rivers and caused flash floods destroying much vegetation. This habitat loss has since been compounded by encroaching agriculture which has cleared much original forest particularly on the Silver Hills in northern Montserrat. <strong>Feral</strong> animals such as pigs and rats have also degraded areas of native vegetation and destroyed seedlings while invasive floral species such as the purple allamanda (<em>Cryptostegia madagascariensis</em>) are smothering native plants (2) (4) (6). As a result of these widespread threats the Montserrat orchid is now rare and has a very restricted distribution (5)<warehouse:ref entitytype="ScientificReference">.</warehouse:ref><warehouse:ref entitytype="ScientificReference"></warehouse:ref>,With over 800 native plant species Montserrat is one of the richest of all the UK Overseas Territories in terms of its plant diversity. The UK Overseas Territories Team at the Royal Botanic Gardens Kew has been involved in conservation projects there since 1998. Once such project entitled 'Enabling the people of Montserrat to conserve the Centre Hills' collected specimens and habitat information and assessed the plant diversity of an area relatively undamaged by volcanic eruptions. An additional project focused more closely on the islands two <strong>endemic</strong> species: the Montserrat orchid and the pribby (<em>Rondeletia buxifolia</em>). Two collections of Montserrat orchid seeds are now stored in Kew\u2019s Millennium Seed Bank. Living Montserrat orchids rescued from dead mango trees have also been taken to the Montserrat National Trust\u2019s botanic garden where they are being cultivated for future display (2).

Animalia,Montserrat oriole ,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Icteridae,Icterus (1),Length: 20 - 22 cm (2),Confined to hill forests on the small island of Montserrat the Montserrat oriole is believed to have formerly had a total range of around 30 square kilometres (7). However volcanic eruptions between 1995 and 1997 destroyed around two-thirds of its habitat all but removing this species from the Soufri\xe8re and South Soufri\xe8re hills and largely restricting it to just the Centre Hills. Initial surveys suggested that much of the population had survived the eruptions with healthy numbers remaining in the Centre Hills and a smaller relict population in the South Soufri\xe8re hills. But between 1997 and 2003 the population declined very rapidly (2) (3). The exact cause of this decline is unknown but potential agents include ash fall on the forest causing insect availability to decrease or chronic ill health of birds (2).\xa0,Since the devastating volcanic eruption that almost caused the extinction of this striking species the Montserrat oriole has been the target of much research and management. In June 1999 eight birds were taken to Jersey Zoo to enable the development of husbandry techniques. Initial attempts at captive breeding proved successful and captive birds are now also present at several other locations in the UK (2).\xa0

Animalia,Mount Glorious spiny crayfish ,Animalia,Arthropoda,Crustacea,Decapoda,Parastacidae,Euastacus (1),,The Mount Glorious spiny crayfish is a particularly vulnerable species due to its extremely restricted range. Localised threats such as bush fires poor forest management practices habitat destruction and over-exploitation by collectors are all known to negatively impact this species\u2019 population. Additionally introduced species such as the cane toad (<em>Bufo marinus</em>) as well as cats foxes pigs and goats have all been found to affect crayfish populations (1) (2).,The range of the Mount Glorious spiny crayfish coincides with Maiala National Park which may afford this species some level of protection. However there are currently no specific conservation measures targeted at the Mount Glorious spiny crayfish (1). All species in the <em>Euastacus</em> <strong>genus</strong> are designated as \u2018no take\u2019 species in Queensland under the Fisheries Act 1994 and must be released if captured (1) (2).

Dominican white-lipped frog, giant ditch frog,Mountain chicken ,Animalia,Chordata,Amphibia,Anura,Leptodactylidae,Leptodactylus (1),c. 700 g (3),An unfortunate victim of hunting disease natural disasters and habitat loss the mountain chicken population has recently undergone catastrophic declines estimated at around 80 percent since 1995 (1) (2). On Dominica this Critically Endangered frog is favoured for its meaty legs which are cooked in traditional West Indian dishes and which are in fact the country\u2019s national dish (6). Annual harvests were thought to be taking between 8000 and 36000 animals before a ban on hunting was introduced and as a result of this exploitation the population on the island is thought to be near extinction (1).,Hunting of the mountain chicken was banned on Dominica in the late 1990s although a three month open season was declared at the end of 2001 and hunting was not fully prohibited until 2003 (1) (3). Public awareness programmes have also been implemented to inform the Dominican public of the threats the mountain chicken faces and to try to discourage hunting (1). \xa0

Broom's pygmy-possum, burramys, mountain pygmy possum,Mountain pygmy-possum ,Animalia,Chordata,Mammalia,Diprotodontia,Burramyidae,Burramys (1),30 - 60 g (2),Due to the restrictions of its habitat requirements the mountain pygmy-possum has suffered from the development of the ski industry in the Australian Alps. A further threat comes from habitat loss caused by increased temperatures and decreasing snow cover as a result of global warming while predation by the red fox (<em>Vulpes vulpes</em>) and feral cats is also a problem\xa0(1)\xa0(2)\xa0(3)\xa0(4). Bushfires in 2003 damaged large areas of habitat\xa0(2) and the mountain pygmy-possum\u2019s main prey the Bogong moth also faces a number of threats including pesticide use in its breeding grounds\xa0(2)\xa0(3). The mountain pygmy-possum occupies just a tiny area estimated at less than seven square kilometres and its populations are highly fragmented putting it at particular risk\xa0(1)\xa0(4).,The entire range of the mountain pygmy-possum occurs within protected areas although important parts of these are in ski-resort lease areas. Management plans for the species have been put in place in Victoria and New South Wales and a national recovery plan is currently being prepared\xa0(1). A range of conservation measures have been recommended for this small possum including protection and restoration of the remaining habitat population and habitat monitoring predator control measures to protect the possums in ski resorts further research and captive breeding programmes\xa0(1)\xa0(3)\xa0(4).

Mlanje cedar, Mlanje cypress, Mulanje cedarwood,Mulanje cedar ,Plantae,Tracheophyta,Coniferopsida,Coniferales,Cupressaceae,Widdringtonia (1),Height: 42.7 m (2)Trunk diameter: 1.5 m (2),The Mulanje cedar has been heavily exploited in the past (3) (5) (9) with its wood used as timber and its sawdust distilled to obtain oil for local use as an insecticide (3) (5) (10). The wood is considered enormously valuable being very fragrant and resistant to termites borers and fungal disease. It is used locally for making carvings boxes and furniture sold to tourists and is also sold abroad for light construction and flooring. The timber is thought to be particularly good for boat-building to the point that fishery officials have urged that remaining supplies be reserved for the Lake Malawi fishing industry. The Forestry Department of Malawi have recently agreed to supply Mulanje Cedar to build 450 boats for this purpose (11). The tree\u2019s decline has been somewhat stemmed by a ban on felling allowing exploitation only of dead trees but illegal felling and killing of trees continues at an alarming rate. The Mulanje Mountain Forest Reserve is also generally threatened by encroachment and large-scale development such as the continual threat of bauxite mining. Additionally there is concern that mature individuals appear to be dying at a high rate thought possibly to be due to their high sensitivity to forest fires and susceptibility to attacks by a species of aphid (3). Regeneration on the other hand seems to depend on fire and is extremely poor. In addition <i>Pinus patula</i> (originally a commercial plantation species) has invaded a number of areas suitable for <i>Widdringtonia</i> colonisation (5) (9). All these threats have greatly impacted the Mulanje cedar; a 2007 study found that the remaining Mulanje cedar forests had been reduced by 40 percent over the previous 15 years (3). Out of the remaining 845.3 hectares of forest identified over 32 percent of standing Mulanje cedar was found to be dead (3). As so much dead wood is available for utilisation there should be no reason to cut live Mulanje cedar (3).,All Mulanje cedars are protected within the Mulanje Mountain Forest Reserve and licences are available now only for the exploitation of dead trees from the Forestry Department of Malawi (3) (9). The Mulanje Mountain Conservation Trust has also been set up to provide long-term support for the research and conservation of biological diversity in the Mulanje Mountain Forest Reserve and the sustainable utilisation of its natural resources. The Trust is working with the Forestry Department of Malawi in bringing in community participation to manage the resources of the forest reserve and maximise the benefits among resource users (12). Not only is the Mulanje cedar a national emblem to Malawi but it is also of critical financial importance to this relatively poor country and as such its protection and sustainable use is a national priority (6).

Munchique wood wren,Munchique wood-wren ,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Troglodytidae,Henicorhina (1),15.2 - 16.7 g (2),Due to its extremely small range and population which is known to be in decline the Munchique wood-wren is currently at high risk of extinction (3). However it has been argued that its classification of Critically Endangered (CR) on the IUCN Red List should be changed as a result of the discovery of another population in southern Antioquia (4).,There are no specific conservation measures currently known to be in place for this species but much of the Munchique wood-wren\u2019s range is in protected areas such as the Munchique National Park and Tambito Nature Reserve. Sadly deforestation continues to occur despite the high numbers of endangered species living in these areas. The budget for conservation is low and increased government spending is not thought to be likely due to current civil conflicts in Colombia (2).

Animalia,Namdapha flying squirrel ,Animalia,Chordata,Mammalia,Rodentia,Sciuridae,Biswamoyopterus (1),Head-body length: 405 mm (2),This little-known flying squirrel has a very restricted range and is currently known from only one location (1). Like other restricted-range species this makes it particularly vulnerable to any threats which could rapidly affect all individuals in the population. The Namdapha flying squirrel is presently threatened by habitat loss and degradation (1) caused by clear-felling for human settlements shifting agriculture and the extraction of non-timber forest products particularly the leaves of a rattan palm <i>Zalacca secunda</i> for use as a roofing material (5).,The Namdapha flying squirrel occurs within Namdapha National Park in Arunachal Pradesh (4). Despite the protection of this large area it is still affected by human activities such as those mentioned above. The Namdapha National Park contains not only the Critically Endangered Namdapha flying squirrel but is also home to populations of other threatened species including tigers (<i>Panthera tigris</i>) snow leopards (<i>Uncia unicia</i>) and Asian elephants (<i>Elephas maximus</i>). The effective protection of the Namdapha National Park is therefore incredibly important but this is also an incredibly difficult aim to achieve. This is not only due to the park\u2019s inaccessibility the lack of legal enforcement and shortage of well-trained and equipped personnel but also due to the local people\u2019s dependence on the forest and the materials it provides. This means that any conservation measures require local people\u2019s participation to be successful (5).

Entre Rios seedeater,Narosky’s seedeater ,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Emberizidae,Sporophila (1),Length: 10 cm (2),A favourite of bird trappers Narosky\u2019s seedeater cannot afford to lose many more individuals to the pet trade. Its existence is also threatened by rapid afforestation with <i>Eucalyptus</i> and <i>Pinus</i> species for logging operations as well as pesticide pollution from drainage and run-off into marshes (2). Continuous over-grazing by livestock and the conversion of suitable habitat into agricultural land add to the need for protected areas to ensure the survival of this species (4).,Narosky\u2019s seedeater has been reported in two national parks in Argentina and a biosphere reserve in Uruguay. However law enforcement is weak and this does not guarantee the persistence of the species in these areas. Proposals to prevent the extinction of Narosky\u2019s seedeater include surveying south Paraguay for breeding populations monitoring known populations developing an action plan removing the incentives for afforestation of grasslands protection of breeding grounds and prohibiting the trapping and keeping of this bird in captivity (2).

Animalia,Negros bleeding-heart ,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Columbiformes,Columbidae,Gallicolumba (1),Size: 30 cm (2),Like the four other bleeding-heart species that occur in the Philippines the Negros bleeding-heart is greatly threatened by the destruction of its habitat.  In 1988 only four percent of forest cover remained on Negros and Panay held on to just eight percent of its forest.  This alarming loss is due to the clearance of forest for agriculture timber and charcoal-burning and these activities remain a serious threat to the remaining fragments of forest.  The effect of this devastating habitat destruction is aggravated by local trapping and hunting of the Negros bleeding-heart for food and presumably for the cage-bird trade (1).  As a result of these threats the extremely small population of Negros bleeding-hearts (estimated to be between 50 and 249 individuals) is still declining (4) which makes it extremely vulnerable to extinction.,Despite the precarious status of the Negros bleeding-heart there are very few specific conservation measures in place.  It occurs within the Mount Canlaon Natural Park on Negros and possibly also in the North Negros Forest Reserve.  However the North Negros Forest Reserve receives virtually no protection at present (7).  On Panay it occurs in the North West Panay Peninsula which was proclaimed a Protected Area in 2001.  Forest Rangers of the Philippine Endemic Species Conservation Project (PESCP) patrol this area and the northern part of the Central Panay Mountain Range destroying snares and curbing illegal logging.  PESCP also ran an Airgun-for-Rice programme as an intervention against hunting in the region; a large number of airguns were destroyed as a result of the programme (5) (10).

Animalia,New Zealand black stilt ,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Charadriiformes,Recurvirostridae,Himantopus (1),220 g (2),The massive decline and retraction in range of the black stilt is mainly attributed to the introduction of mammalian predators to New Zealand such as cats ferrets and stoats (6). In the Mackenzie Basin ongoing large-scale rabbit control programmes since the 1940s may have forced feral cats to switch to hunting native birds instead (3). Habitat modification has also contributed to the decline of this species (1); a massive hydroelectric scheme in the basin has considerably altered the natural habitat (7). Today mammalian predators still represent the major threat to the continued survival of this species along with <strong>hybridisation</strong> with the closely related Australasian pied stilt which successfully colonised New Zealand subsequent to European settlement in the 1800's (6). Since the 1970's the small remnant breeding population of black stilts has been restricted in range to the Mackenzie Basin where it has been intensively protected and managed (5). If numbers continue to fall <strong>hybridisation</strong> will become an even bigger problem as individuals find it harder to find mates within their own species.,Since the mid-1900's pure black stilts have numbered fewer than 100 individuals; in 1999 numbers fell as low as 40 only 9 of which were females (6). Since the 1970's intensive predator control protection and manipulation of wild nests and captive breeding and release programmes have been the only factors preventing this species from becoming extinct in the wild (5). The New Zealand Department of Conservation set out a new Kak\xef Recovery Plan in 2001 (3) in a concerted effort to save this species. Phase one of the plan aims to increase numbers in the wild through captive rearing and release programmes along with predator control measures (3). The second phase of the Recovery Plan aims to identify the causes of breeding failure in the wild (3). Recent improvements in release techniques have increased the initial survival of released birds to as much as 80 to 100 percent and these are encouraging results (6) although factors that inhibit recovery remain.

Acrocephalus luscinia,Nightingale reed-warbler ,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Sylviidae,Acrocephalus (1),Length: 18 cm (2)Average male weight: 35.9 g (3)Average female weight: 32 g (3),The story of how the nightingale reed-warbler was extirpated from Guam Pagan and Tinian is one echoed by many island species across the world. Human impact through habitat destruction and the use of harmful insecticides (such as <strong>DDT</strong>) combined with natural factors such as volcanic activity and widespread fires are thought to be partially responsible (4) (5) (6) (9). However the largest impact on the nightingale reed-warbler has been from the introduction of the brown tree snake (<em>Boiga irregularis</em>) believed to be responsible for the warbler\u2019s final extirpation from Guam in 1969 (2) (4).,A great deal of conservation work has been and continues to be undertaken to ensure the survival of this Critically Endangered bird. Currently it is protected by the U.S. Endangered Species Act making it illegal to hunt kill or possess a nightingale reed-warbler or its eggs. Furthermore the wetland habitats where a great number of populations live are protected under the U.S. Clean Water Act and in 1998 a recovery plan for the species was produced by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (4) (11).

Ibis chauve,Northern bald ibis ,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Ciconiiformes,Threskiornithidae,Geronticus (1),Length: 70 - 80 cm (2),The reasons for the long-term decline of this species are poorly understood and may in part be due to natural causes (5). The recent precipitous decline however is almost undoubtedly linked to hunting and persecution disturbance at the breeding sites and the loss of suitable habitat such as <strong>steppe</strong> and unintensive arable land and flooding of foraging areas due to construction of dams and drainage of wetlands (5) (8). Pesticide poisoning has also had disastrous consequences most notably in Turkey in the late 1950s when hundreds were killed outright by DDT (sprayed to kill mosquitoes) with the survivors subsequently suffering very low breeding success (8) (9). In May 1996 40 of the Moroccan birds died in just nine days due to an epidemic of unknown cause demonstrating how vulnerable the small remnant populations are (8).,BirdLife International and the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds (RSPB) have been working alongside local people to research and monitor this enigmatic species. A major step has been to train and manage a team of wardens in Morocco to monitor breeding and roosting sites prevent disturbance by tourists or fishermen collect information and make local people aware of the bird\u2019s significance; these conservation measures have resulted in a recent slight population increase (1) (7). The recently discovered Syrian population is also being carefully monitored (7).

Wombat À Narines Poilues Du Queensland, Wombat À Nez Poilu De Queensland,Northern hairy-nosed wombat ,Animalia,Chordata,Mammalia,Diprotodontia,Vombatidae,Lasiorhinus (1),Male head-body length: 102 cm (2)Female head-body length: 107 cm (2)Height: 40 cm (2)Male weight: 30 kg (2)Female weight: 32.5 kg (2),This wombat may have already been uncommon when Europeans settled but the decline accelerated due to a combination of drought and competition with introduced grazing livestock (9). Habitat alteration and incidental poisoning may also have contributed to the decline (2). The species may now be vulnerable to predation by dingoes and competition with native species for food (5).,Huge efforts have been made to conserve this species (6). In 1971 the Epping Forest National Park was established to protect the last population of northern hairy-nosed wombats and by 1982 cattle had been excluded from the area (10). A recovery plan has been produced; the aims of this plan include the establishment of a captive rearing facility (2) and the creation of a second wild population. Suitable sites for <strong>re-introduction</strong> are currently being identified. The long-term aim of the plan is to establish a network of populations throughout the historic range (5). In 1981 estimates put the population at just 20 to 40 individuals this had risen to 110 in 2000 (11) but there may be as few as 20 breeding females (11) so it is clear that the status of this species is very precarious and that determined long-term conservation efforts are essential if it is to step back from the brink of extinction.

northern woolly spider monkey,Northern muriqui ,Animalia,Chordata,Mammalia,Primates,Atelidae,Brachyteles (1),Male head-body length: 55 – 78 cm (2)Female head-body length: 50 – 65 cm (2)Male tail length: 74 – 80 cm (2)Female tail length: 65 – 74 cm (2)Male weight: 12 – 15 kg (2)Female weight: 9.5 – 11 kg (2),The northern muriqui was once widespread in the Atlantic Forest region but today there are only a handful of sub-populations in nine or more protected areas including Rio Doce State Park Capara\xf3 National Park Serra do Brigadeiro State Park and Augusto Ruschi Biological Reserve (1) (2) (4). The total known population is very low at only 300 to 400 individuals (2) and the largest sub-population recorded has only 157 individuals which severely limits the group\u2019s breeding potential (1). This species is threatened by habitat destruction as it occurs in one of the most populated and industrious region of Brazil (4). Vast tracts of forest have been lost and the remaining healthy forests are fragmented and at risk of being destroyed in the future. In addition these large primates were an important food source for people in the region and have been widely hunted (4).,The muriqui has been a flagship species for the conservation of Brazil\u2019s fragile Atlantic Forest region (8). However information on these critically endangered primates is still lacking and data on population distribution and status is urgently required. Programme Muriqui has been undertaking research on populations within the Serra dos Organos National Park; the possibility of reintroductions is being investigated and an ongoing education programme has been established (9).

Lemur Comadreja Septentrional,Northern sportive lemur ,Animalia,Chordata,Mammalia,Primates,Lepilemuridae,Lepilemur (1),700 - 800 g (2),Like much of the native fauna of Madagascar northern sportive lemurs are at risk from loss of their habitats (2). Much of this habitat destruction is caused by extensive \u2018slash and burn\u2019 techniques as forests are destroyed to provide more agricultural land for an increasing population (8). The animals are also hunted for food in spite of being officially protected (2).,The population of northern sportive lemurs is believed to be between 10000 and 100000 animals with as many as 564 individuals per square kilometre in some areas. It has been recorded in four protected areas in the north of Madagascar (2).

Noguchi's woodpecker, Pryer's woodpecker,Okinawa woodpecker ,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Piciformes,Picidae,Dendrocopos (1),Length: 31 - 35 cm (2),The Okinawa woodpecker requires forest that is at least 30 years of age and a vast amount of suitable habitat on the island has been lost in the past century (2). Logging dam construction road building and agricultural development have all caused losses of prime habitat (3). The species is now restricted to small and fragmented populations that are at inherent risk from chance events such as disease and natural disasters (2).,The Okinawa woodpecker is protected by law in Japan and the area within which it is found was declared a National Park in 1996 (2). Deforestation is continuing to encroach on remaining tracts of pristine habitat however and further action is still needed (2). Some conservation organisations have purchased areas of habitat in an effort to secure the future of this native bird and investigation into the possibility of forest 'corridors' linking protected habitat is required (2).

Alula, Cabbage on a stick, Haha, Pu aupaka,Olulu ,Plantae,Tracheophyta,Magnoliopsida,Campanulales,Campanulaceae,Brighamia (2),Height: 1 – 2 m (3),Primary explanations offered for the decline of the \u2018olulu include competition from introduced invasive plants (3) loss of its natural pollinators (7) and destruction by naturally occurring stochastic events such as land slides or hurricanes (6). Hurricane-force winds have recently scoured the Na Pali sea cliffs killing many plants (7). Additionally while most populations are found on virtually inaccessibly sea-cliffs the Waiahuakua population on Kaua\u2019i is more accessible and has suffered damage from the activities of feral goats (6). In the early 1990s Kaua\u2019i had a total of approximately 150 individuals on the Na Pali sea cliffs where today there remain only seven (7). With such critically low numbers there is a concern that genetic variability will get too low as a result of inbreeding between remaining plants for the species to adequately respond to environmental pressures (7) (3). Thus although once fairly common this species is now teetering on the brink of extinction in the wild (8).,Botanists and horticulturists concerned about the plight of Hawaii\u2019s threatened plant species have helped save this fantastic plant from total extinction by pollinating the remaining wild specimens by hand and collecting seeds for propagation (8). Successful germination of the seeds has enabled large numbers of plants to be grown in botanical gardens to be used in a replanting programme (8). Today there are more plants in the Limahuli Gardens and McBride Gardens on Kaua\u2019i than there are in the wild (5)! Endangered species may benefit from increased artificial gene flow especially if they have passed through a genetic bottleneck due to <strong>inbreeding depression</strong> and hand pollination experiments have aided in this respect (7). Investigation into possible alternative pollinators is also being planned (7). Such research will undoubtedly aid the creation of guidelines for the re-introduction of the magnificent \u2018olulu into protected cliff sites where it once flourished (7).

Loro Ventrinaranja, Periquito Ventrinaranja,Orange-bellied parrot ,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Psittachiformes,Psittacidae,Neophema (1),45 - 50 g (2),This previously abundant species has suffered a precipitous decline in numbers since the 1920s primarily due to habitat loss at the overwintering grounds caused by both urban development and farming practices (5) (6). Competition with introduced species for both food and nest sites together with predation by red foxes and feral cats have further depleted populations of\xa0orange-bellied parrots\xa0(6).,An Orange-Bellied Parrot Action Plan has been running since 1980 aiming to improve the conservation status of this species so that it is no longer classified as Critically Endangered (2). Populations are regularly monitored and areas of habitat particularly in the winter grounds are protected as reserves (2). The control of predators occurs in some areas and in the moorland habitat of Tasmania controlled burning is used to increase food productivity (2). A captive breeding programme has also been set up to augment wild population numbers and by 1999 72 birds had been released into the wild with some successfully completing the return migration (2). To date the success of the Action Plan has been mixed; some intensively managed populations are showing encouraging increases in numbers whilst others continue to fall (6). There are still fewer than 200 individuals (6) in the wild and intensive conservation work will be vital for the future of this colourful bird.

Orange-footed pearlymussel, Orange-footed pimpleback mussel,Orangefoot pimpleback ,Animalia,Mollusca,Bivalvia,Unionoida,Unionidae,Plethobasus (1),Length: up to 10 cm (2)Width: up to 4.6 cm (3)Height: up to 7.8 cm (3),One of the greatest threats to the orangefoot pimpleback and other freshwater mussels in North America is the <strong>invasive</strong> zebra mussel (<em>Dreissena polymorpha</em>) (7). Hundreds to thousands of minute zebra mussels can attach to the shell of native mussels which can eventually kills the contaminated individual by interfering with its ability to feed respire excrete and move (7).,The orangefoot pimpleback is classified as federally endangered in the United States which gives the species some protection from direct harm (5). The orangefoot pimpleback is also listed on Appendix I of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) (4) meaning that international trade in this species is strictly prohibited without a permit. The United States Fish and Wildlife Service has released several summaries and action plans for the conservation of this freshwater mussel (5) (7) which include surveying areas with known populations and establishing a captive breeding and reintroduction programme (7).

Crocodile De L'Orénoque,Orinoco crocodile ,Animalia,Chordata,Reptilia,Crocodylia,Crocodylidae,Crocodylus (1),Male length: up to 5 m (2)Female length: up to 3.2 m (2)Male weight: 380 kg (2)Female weight: 200 kg (2),The Orinoco crocodile was hunted to the brink of extinction for its skin during the 1930s to 60s and the population has shown little signs of recovery since (4) although reintroduction programs are underway. Crocodiles could be found in large numbers around small water areas during the dry season which made them easy targets for hunters (2). Today there are an estimated 250 to 1500 individuals left in the wild (2). Illegal hunting for meat and for teeth (which are thought to have medicinal properties) along with the collection of eggs and juveniles remains the major threat to this species (2). Further threats are posed from continued habitat destruction killing by local people and from competition with the spectacle caiman (<i>Caiman crocodilus</i>) which is found in the same area (2).,Orinoco crocodiles are one of the most highly endangered of all <strong>crocodilians</strong> due to the small size and highly fragmented nature of their population (2). International trade in this species is banned under Appendix I of the Convention of International Trade in Endangered Species (CTIES) (3) and it is protected throughout much of its range (4). These protection measures however are largely ineffective and unforced and illegal poaching remains the principal threat to this species (2). In Colombia very little is known about the current status of the species and this remains a high priority for any conservation action plan (4). In Venezuela a reintroduction/ restocking plan has been developed and captive breeding is carried out at a number of sites (4).  Effective monitoring of released crocodiles is required and protection measures need to be properly enforced in order to help this species recover from such crippling over-exploitation in the past (4).

Pelias orlovi, Vipera kaznakovi,Orlov's viper ,Animalia,Chordata,Reptilia,Squamata,Viperidae,Vipera (1),Adult length: 50+ cm (2),With a population estimated to comprise less than 250 mature individuals fragmented into poorly connected sub-populations Orlov's viper is dangerously close to becoming extinct in the wild. Like many other reptile species around the world the principal threat to its survival is the uncontrolled collection of wild specimens for the pet trade (1). The poaching of rare species is alarmingly widespread in the mountains of the Caucasus with the illegal wildlife trade being one of the main conservation concerns in the region (10).,Owing to its precarious status in the wild Orlov's viper is in dire need of a raft of immediate conservation measures. The main priorities include the establishment of reserves where this Critically Endangered snake will be protected from poaching; the development of conservation legislation particularly concerning the regulation of trade; the implementation of education programmes for local people; and further research into the species' natural history distribution and population dynamics (1).

Painted batagur, Saw-jawed terrapin, Three-striped batagur,Painted terrapin ,Animalia,Chordata,Reptilia,Testudines,Emydidae,Callagur (1),1.7 kg (2),This species is now rare throughout much of its former range with only one or two rivers home to more than 100 nesting females (2). Painted terrapins are massively exploited for their eggs which are sold for human consumption in many parts of Asia (5). Terrapin eggs are worth five times as much as chicken eggs and this species is particularly vulnerable to over-exploitation due to its low egg productivity (2). Habitat destruction is another major source of species decline; sand mining beach protection and beachfront development all disrupt the breeding habits of the terrapins (2).,International trade in painted terrapins is banned by its listing on Appendix I of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) (1) and protective legislation is also in place in most of Peninsular Malaysia (2). Egg harvesting may only be carried out by licensed collectors who then sell 70 percent of their haul to the Malaysian Fisheries Department to be incubated thus ensuring the sustainable management of this species (2). Prices offered by the Fisheries Department are however not competitive with those obtained on the black market and in the majority of cases only a very small percentage of turtle eggs are recovered (2). The enforcement of these schemes is a priority for future conservation action plans along with the protection of areas where significant populations are known to exist. A decline in the demand for terrapin eggs is the key to saving this species from extinction but would require a cultural change amongst local communities.

Animalia,Palila ,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Drepanididae,Loxioides (1),Length: 19 cm (2),The sub-alpine forest occupied by the palila has been severely over-browsed by sheep and goats and palila nests are preyed upon by feral cats introduced rats and the short-eared owl (<i>Asio flammeus</i>). It is thought that introduced grasses suppress the regeneration of the palila\u2019s main food source the mamane as well as increasing the risk of fire. The spread of feral pigs is also expected to suppress mamane regeneration (2).,The recent removal of sheep and goats from Mauna Kea\u2019s slopes has allowed some mamane regeneration but re-colonisation of suitable habitat is proving more difficult than expected (2). The palila will return to its home range following human intervention (7) as was found when several pairs were <strong>translocated</strong> in 1993 (2). A larger <strong>translocation</strong> was attempted in 2002 to test whether a more natural social environment and a larger pool of potential mates might encourage the <strong>translocated</strong> birds to remain in their new area. Several captive breeding programmes have been implemented with some early successes (2).

Plantae,Palm ,Plantae,Tracheophyta,Liliopsida,Arecales,Palmae,Ravenea (1),Trunk height: 1.5 - 3 m (2),Deforestation to make way for agriculture is a major threat to many different species in Madagascar. Additionally <i>Ravenea louvelii</i> may only be found on a single ridge-top where it is highly vulnerable to disturbance and fruit dispersal appears to be extremely limited (3). Over-collection by palm enthusiasts provides a further threat to the survival of this unusual species (3).,This palm is currently not found within any protected areas and gathering more information on the restricted nature of the population is a conservation priority (3).

Plantae,Palm ,Plantae,Tracheophyta,Liliopsida,Arecales,Palmae,Ravenea (1),Trunk height: 2.5 - 8 m (2),This palm is only known from a single river and is therefore extremely vulnerable to chance events such as storms and to habitat disturbance (2). Local people use the timber from <em>Ravenea musicalis</em> to fashion small canoe-like boats known as 'pirogues' (5). The area near where <em>Ravenea musicalis</em> occurs has been earmarked for large-scale titanium oxide mining; if mining goes ahead the impact on the ecology of all surrounding areas could be very severe and could affect the survival of this species (4).,Should this unique species be tragically lost from the wild there are hopes that it will persist in cultivation; <em>Ravenea musicalis</em> seeds have been collected and distributed to botanic gardens in Madagascar and around the world (4). However <em>Ravenea musicalis</em> has proved to be very difficult to maintain in cultivation (3).

Rodrigues bottle palm, spindle palm,Palmiste marron ,Plantae,Tracheophyta,Liliopsida,Arecales,Palmae,Hyophorbe (1),Height: up to 12 m (2)Trunk height: 6 - 9 m (2)Trunk diameter: 25 - 45 cm (2),Although widely cultivated as an ornamental palm (1) (5) (7) the palmiste marron is the second rarest palm on Rodrigues with fewer than 60 individuals left in the wild and little if any natural regeneration occurring on the island (1) (7) (8). The main threats to the species are overgrazing by cows sheep and goats as well as invasion by non-native plants high levels of seed predation by rats and severe fragmentation of the population (1) (7) (8). With such a tiny population events such as cyclones can also have catastrophic effects on this palm (8). Although the palmiste marron is being increasingly cultivated on Rodrigues to be planted as part of a habitat restoration project there is a threat of <strong>hybridisation</strong> with <em>Hyophorbe lagenicaulis</em> which has been introduced from Round Island (1) (7) (8).,Conservation measures recommended for the palmiste marron and other <strong>endemic</strong> palms of the Mascarene Islands include fencing and weeding of areas of native forest to protect the remaining wild palms as well as propagating species and re-introducing them into the wild and undertaking further biological research (7) (8). It will also be important to involve local communities with education programmes incentives from tourism and palm plantations and stricter laws for cutting down palms (7). The palmiste marron needs to be protected from <strong>hybridisation</strong> with closely-related palm species and legislation is needed to ban the introduction of non-native palms to Rodrigues. Palms that have already been introduced will also need to be removed although this has proved difficult to date because most are being grown in private gardens (7). Without a long-term conservation programme this unique and Critically Endangered palm is in great danger of becoming extinct in the wild (8).

Animalia,Pan's box turtle ,Animalia,Chordata,Reptilia,Testudines,Bataguridae,Cuora (1),,Many of the Asian turtles including Pan's box turtle are severely threatened by the over-collection of both adults and eggs. The popularity of turtle meat once considered a luxury increased dramatically in the 1990s due in part to growing economies across Asia. This market has decimated native populations which are unable to sustain the demand and coupled with habitat loss has pushed many species to the brink of extinction (6).,In recognition of the precarious state of the population of Pan's box turtle the World Conservation Union (IUCN) classifies this species as Critically Endangered (1). International trade is restricted by the listing of this turtle of Appendix II of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) (2) but further research is desperately needed before more effective conservation measures can be put into place.

Brazilian monkey puzzle tree, Candelabra tree,Parana pine ,Plantae,Tracheophyta,Coniferopsida,Coniferales,Araucariaceae,Araucaria (1),Araucaria (1),Having suffered from intensive unsustainable logging throughout the 20th<sup>\xa0 </sup>century today the Parana pine exists only in relic populations (1). As an important commercial species the high quality wood of the Parana pine was exploited for the timber trade and its highly nutritious fruits were sold for human consumption (1) (4). However the Parana pine now occupies a patchy distribution across a limited range and consequently is one of Brazil\u2019s rarest trees (5). Amongst the remaining population there is a significant lack of fruiting trees which has severely limited the species\u2019 reproductive ability (4) (5). This has been further compounded by the annual exploitation of 3400 tons of its fruits and seeds. Attempts have been made to reintroduce the species into parts of its historical range but this has been prevented by the spread of competitive <em>Pinus</em> and <em>Eucalyptus</em> species and agricultural encroachment (1). \xa0\xa0\xa0,The survival of the Parana pine is now dependant upon the implementation of major conservation measures. The Brazilian government introduced a ban on the sale of this species in 2001 preventing further logging and several protected areas have been created with the objective of protecting remaining populations including the Campos do Jordao State Park the Irati National Park and the Cacador National Park (1) (2). Plans have also been developed to maintain the species\u2019 genetic diversity and the number of fruiting trees through seed collection improved forestry management practices and the development of locally coordinated agro-forestry schemes (4) (5).\xa0

Lacerta martinezricai,Pena de Francia rock lizard ,Animalia,Chordata,Reptilia,Squamata,Lacertidae,Iberolacerta (1),Snout-vent length: c. 8 cm (2),The tiny distribution of the Pe\xf1a de Francia lizard and its accordingly small population makes it intrinsically vulnerable to any threats.  These threats currently come in the form of ever-increasing tourist pressure the construction of roads and the use of all-terrrain vehicles (1) (3).  The collection of specimens may also be contributing to the decline in lizard numbers which has been observed over the last three decades.  In addition it is thought that the Pe\xf1a de Francia rock lizard may be very sensitive to any changes to the climate in its habitat and thus could be affected in the future by global climate change (1) (3).,The entire range of the Pe\xf1a de Francia rock lizard lies within the \u2018Parque Natural de las Batuecas y Sierra de Francia\u2019 a protected natural area (3) but this clearly does not protect it from all threats such as increasing tourism and thus a specific management plan for the recovery of this species is required (1).  It has been suggested that captive breeding should be one of the actions included in the recovery strategy (1).

All the <strong>subspecies</strong> of Pennant\u2019s red colobus are close to extinction with very restricted ranges and small numbers as a result of extensive habitat loss and intensive hunting (7).,Pennant\u2019s red colobus is listed on Appendix II of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) meaning that international trade in this species should be carefully controlled (4). It is also listed on Class B of the African Convention on the Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources which means that Pennant\u2019s red colobus may only be captured or killed with special authorisation (9).

Propithecus diadema perrieri,Perrier’s sifaka ,Animalia,Chordata,Mammalia,Primates,Indriidae,Propithecus (1),3.7 – 5 kg (2),Like many of Madagascar\u2019s primates Perrier\u2019s sifaka is threatened by hunting and habitat loss. Suitable forest habitat is diminishing as a result of land clearance for agriculture and livestock timber harvesting for charcoal and construction and small-scale mining for gemstones (4) and even within a so-called protected area where this species occurs an annual deforestation rate of 1.2 percent has been recorded (6). Whilst taboos against hunting once existed in many parts of Madagascar the increase in immigrants without belief in such taboos has led to a worrying growth in hunting (2). Such threats have already reduced this species\u2019 population to perilously low levels - in 2003-2004 it was estimated there were only 915 individuals remaining \u2013 and continue to push Perrier\u2019s sifaka towards extinction (6). Such a small population is at great risk of problems arising from loss of <strong>genetic variation</strong> making the long term viability of this species highly questionable (2) (6).,Analamerana Special Reserve harbours the majority of the Perrier\u2019s sifaka population (1) although rather than offering the protection this rare species requires forest within the reserve is still being gradually destroyed (1) (6) and this species clearly requires further protection if it is going to survive. Since 2005 a group of interested parties led by the Monaco-based non-governmental organisation Act for Nature and the Groupe d\u2019Etude et de Recherche sur les Primates de Madagascar have been conducting a conservation and research programme for Perrier\u2019s sifaka. The programme\u2019s goals are to secure this species\u2019 future in at least one major area currently without any degree of protection and to gain further scientific knowledge on this species that will help inform future conservation measures (7). The area between Analamerana Special Reserve and Ankarana Special Reserve is one area where forest protection has been strongly recommended (4).

red-vented cockatoo,Philippine cockatoo ,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Psittaciformes,Psittacidae,Cacatua (1),300 g (2),Once widespread and fairly common the Philippine cockatoo has recently undergone a dramatic decline and is now one of the most threatened birds of the Philippines (7).  A combination of trapping for the <strong>aviculture</strong> trade and widespread deforestation has pushed the Philippine cockatoo towards the edge of extinction and it is now absent from 98 percent of its former range (2) (7).  A 1994 study showed this bird to be present on just eight of the Philippine islands (6).  Its remote forest habitat and agile flight are no deterrents for trappers who know the exact location of many of its nest holes and roosting sites and frequently raid them (7) (8).  In addition the Philippine cockatoo is persecuted for the damage it inflicts on crops (6) and an outbreak of Psittacine beak and feather disease may also be impacting the population (7).,The critically endangered Philippine cockatoo is listed on Appendix I of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) meaning that trade in this species is only permitted in exceptional circumstances (3) and it is also occurs in a number of protected areas (6).  In addition the Philippine Cockatoo Conservation Program implemented in 1998 is carrying out a number of measures to ensure the cockatoo\u2019s survival.  This includes researching the cockatoo\u2019s behaviour breeding habits and potentially threatening diseases; encouraging poachers and hunters to end their unsustainable activities and become wardens island rangers and guides instead; and a captive breeding program that serves as a safe-guard against this species\u2019 extinction (8).  With such valuable efforts taking place hopefully the current perilous situation will soon improve for the handsome Philippine cockatoo.

Animalia,Philippine crocodile ,Animalia,Chordata,Reptilia,Crocodylia,Crocodylidae,Crocodylus (1),Male length: up to 3 m (2),The massive population decline of the Philippine crocodile was originally caused by excessive over-exploitation for commercial use (2). Today habitat destruction is the most pressing threat to species survival with rainforests being cleared throughout the region to make way for rice fields in an effort to cope with the human population explosion (2). Locals in this area are also in contact with the infamous esturine or 'saltwater' crocodile (<i>Crocodylus porosus</i>) which is one of the largest reptiles in the world and has a reputation as a man-eater. This factor undoubtedly contributes to local intolerance of any crocodile species even the small Philippine crocodile which is often killed when encountered (5). The very word for 'crocodile' in the Filipino language is a vile insult (7).,Next to the Chinese alligator (<i>Alligator sinensis</i>) the Philippine crocodile is considered to be the most endangered crocodilian in the world. Some authorities believe there may be less than 100 individuals left in the wild (3) although some wild habitat still remains. Urgent research is needed to assess the current status in order to implement an effective management strategy for this remaining wild population (3). This species is protected from international trade by its listing on Appendix I of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) but there is only one officially protected area within the Philippines and this is poorly enforced (3). At present captive breeding takes place in a small programme run by the Silliman University and at the government-run Crocodile Farming Institute which breeds crocodiles for commercial and conservation reasons (3). Sadly there is currently little political will or local tolerance to save this ancient reptile in the wild and for the short term at least captive breeding programmes may be the key to the at least nominal survival of this crocodile (3).

great Philippine eagle, monkey-eating eagle,Philippine eagle ,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Falconiformes,Accipitridae,Pithecophaga (1),6.5 kg (2),Although probably never abundant the population of the Philippine eagle has undergone a precipitous decline primarily as the result of habitat destruction (5). Vast tracts of tropical forests in the Philippines have been cleared for commercial development and for shifting cultivation (5). Mining activities and hunting pose further threats to the survival of this majestic bird and the accumulation of pesticides may be responsible for a reduction in reproductive rate (5).,The Philippine eagle is protected by law in the Philippines and occurs in a number of protected areas (5); international trade and movement of this species is also restricted and controlled by CITES (the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species) (1) (3). The Philippine Eagle Conservation Programme (2) is working on educational campaigns protecting and monitoring nests and a conservation breeding scheme (7); so far two captive-bred chicks have been produced with the aim of reintroducing them to the wild (6). In addition chicks and eggs have been taken from areas of habitat at risk in order to establish a viable captive population from which individuals can be reintroduced to the wild (2). Despite these efforts however should habitat loss and subsequent human settlement continue at the current rate it seems doubtful that this majestic species will ever recover.

Such rarity has gained the Philippine pond turtle somewhat of a legendary reputation one that makes any further discovered individuals highly vulnerable to the pet trade where they would be a highly desired and valuable object (1).,Further research into the Philippine pond turtle is clearly needed (4) as more information would allow appropriate conservation actions to be implemented before time runs out for this mysterious reptile.

Animalia,Pink velvet worm ,Animalia,Onychophora,Onychophora,Onychophora,Peripatopsidae,Opisthopatus (1),Length: up to 40 mm (2),The Ngele Forest in which the pink velvet worm lives was heavily logged in the early 1900s after a private sawmill was built nearby in 1891 (1). The remaining forest is patchy and continues to be destroyed as exotic plantations are planted around and right up to the edges of the indigenous forest the harvesting of which is greatly disruptive to the forest (1). Timber plantations are also associated with a high level of invasion by alien plants. The construction of a national road through Ngele Forest has fragmented habitat and potentially populations of the pink velvet worm.,Although a permit is required to collect any animals from the province and some degree of habitat protection has been given by the State access to the area where this species occurs remains relatively uncontrolled (1). Future conservation measures advocated include a publicity campaign to raise awareness of the species and further research on population numbers range and biology of the species (1). Fortunately five specimens are currently thriving in captivity in Hamburg providing the opportunity to study their life cycle reproduction and feeding behaviour (6). Although this captive population safeguards the survival of the species for the time being more needs to be done to protect the pink velvet worm\u2019s diminishing restricted habitat if this ancient unusual and elusive species has any chance of surviving in the wild.

In Indonesia habitat destruction is a major problem as a result of illegal and commercial logging and large agricultural projects such as rubber and oil palm plantations (7).  Sumatra has a very high rate of habitat loss with some areas losing up to 65 percent of their forest cover in the last 25 years (8).\xa0Only 33.8 percent of Sumatra remains covered by <strong>primary forest</strong> and only 1.3 percent of this is upper montane vegetation in which <i>Nepenthes lavicola </i>is found.  The highly localised distribution of <i>Nepenthes lavicola</i> makes it particularly susceptible to the impacts of habitat disturbance or catastrophic environmental events such as drought or fire.  In addition highland plants such as <i>Nepenthes lavicola</i> take longer than lowland plants to recover from any disturbance as growth is slower (2).,<i>Nepenthes lavicola </i>is listed on Appendix II of the Convention of International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) which limits international trade in this species.

Angonoka, Madagascar angulated tortoise, Madagascar tortoise,Ploughshare tortoise ,Animalia,Chordata,Reptilia,Testudines,Testudinidae,Astrochelys (1),Shell length: up to 43 cm (2).,The main threats affecting this very rare species include habitat loss largely as a result of uncontrolled bush fires predation of eggs and young by the introduced bush pig (<i>Potamochoerus larvatus</i>) and illegal collecting by people (5) (8). Like other tortoises and turtles this species has a slow growth rate and low breeding potential. In addition it takes individuals a long time to reach sexual maturity. All of these factors reduce the capacity of populations to recover from human-induced effects on the population (5) (7).,A recovery programme was established for this species in 1986 by the Jersey Wildlife Preservation Trust in collaboration with the Malagasy Department of Waters and Forests.  A captive-breeding facility was established in Madagascar and within eight years over 100 young ploughshare tortoises had been bred. A study into the habitat of the species and interactions with humans was also established and a grassroots-level environmental education programme was set up (10). Experimental reintroductions of captive-bred tortoises have been successful to date and large-scale release to re-establish extirpated populations are being planned (5). Although international trade in the ploughshare tortoise is illegal due to its listing under Appendix I of the Convention of International trade in Endangered Species (CITES) poor enforcement of the exotic pet trade is causing great problems. In 1996 73 individuals were stolen from the captive breeding programme in Madagascar and as recently as 2003 reptile collectors have been arrested with wild ploughshare tortoises in their possession destined for the international exotic pet market (5). When a species is this rare outrageous crimes such as these have serious implications for the already precarious state of the species (11).  These incidents have highlighted weaknesses in wildlife law which must be urgently addressed (11).

Cyclones storms and habitat loss are also likely to have had a significant impact with the largest atolls with the richest vegetation having been cleared for coconut plantations (2) (4).,Several surveys have been conducted on islands in the Tuamotu Archipelago (2) including an expedition by MANU (BirdLife in French Polynesia) sponsered by the BP Conservation Programme (5). A follow-up expedition by the BP Conservation Programme was planned for 2000 to 2001 to initiate protection measures and management plans to conserve the Polynesian ground-dove (2) (5). These plans included conducting important research into the ecology of the bird protecting its habitat from human disturbance raising local awareness of the species and initiating a captive breeding programme on Tahiti to safeguard the species from extinction. Introduced predators would also be eradicated from a suitable nearby island with the aim of translocating ground-doves there (5).

Overall this species has undergone a population decline of over 80 percent in the past decade (1) (6) (7) mainly due to the loss and degradation of its habitat (1) (5) (6) (7).,The Portuguese Red Book lists the Portuguese arched-mouth nase as Critically Endangered (6). This species is covered by national and international conservation legislation (6) including the Bern Convention (12) and EU Habitats Directive (13). However although various sites have been listed under the Habitats Directive they still need management and planning measures directed at the Portuguese arched-mouth nase (6).

Plantae,Pribby ,Plantae,Tracheophyta,Equisetopsida,Gentianales,Rubiaceae,Rondeletia (1),,Between 1995 and 1997 an active volcano erupted on Montserrat resulting in widespread devastation of the island\u2019s natural landscape. Hot ash gases and rocks destroyed trees blocked rivers and caused flash floods destroying much vegetation (4) (5). Prior to this event the pribby was known only from herbarium specimens collected in 1979. However surveys on Montserrat in 2006 rediscovered the pribby but found it to be rare with a total distribution of just 17 square kilometres. Furthermore most of its populations were found to be situated outside of the island\u2019s one protected forest area (2) (3).\xa0,With over 800 native plant species Montserrat is one of the richest of all the UK Overseas Territories in terms of its plant diversity. The UK Overseas Territories team at the Royal Botanic Gardens Kew has been involved in conservation projects in Montserrat since 1998. Once such project entitled 'Enabling the people of Montserrat to conserve the Centre Hills' collected specimens and habitat information and assessed the plant diversity of an area relatively undamaged by volcanic eruptions. An additional project focused more closely on the islands two <strong>endemic</strong> species; the pribby and the Montserrat orchid (<em>Epidendrum montserratense</em>) (4) (5). After this survey rediscovered several populations of the pribby the Botanic Garden in Montserrat planted a demonstration hedge of this species to assess its potential as a native hedging plant for use instead of introduced species. In addition it has recently flowered in Kew's nursery glasshouses which is the first time its flowers have been seen outside Montserrat (2).

small Kauai thrush,Puaiohi ,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Turdidae,Myadestes (1),37 – 43 g (3),The puaiohi and other native Hawaiian birds face a range of threats including disease introduced predators and competitors habitat damage forest clearance and human population growth (5). Many of these threats interlink making the problems harder to resolve.\xa0,The puaiohi is protected by federal and state law and its range is part of a reserve the Alaka`I Wilderness Preserve established in 1964 (3) (7). A successful captive breeding programme is in place for the species and numerous captive-bred individuals have been released back into the wild (2). As a consequence the breeding population numbers are rising so the species may be moved from Critically Endangered to the less threatened status of Endangered in the future (2).

‘olulu, alula, haha, pu aupaka,Pua’ala ,Plantae,Tracheophyta,Magnoliopsida,Campanulales,Campanulaceae,Brighamia (1),Height: 1 – 5 m (1),Once fairly common the pua\u2019ala is now at risk of extinction due to habitat degradation predation by feral goats and competition from introduced plant and animal species (4). Low reproductive rates which exacerbate the problem by making recovery slow could be due to low pollen production low establishment of seedlings and the decline of natural pollinators (5). An additional fear is low genetic variability as a result of inbreeding between the few remaining plants will mean failure to produce healthy seedlings able of responding to environmental change (4).,The Conservation Department of the National Tropical Botanical Garden (NTBG) in Hawaii has taken a lead in the conservation of this rare and unusual species by conducting manual pollination and seed collection. As a result cultivated conservation collections have been established which will ensure against total extinction. Recovery plans are being created that will investigate possible alternative pollinators and create guidelines for the reintroduction of the pua\u2019ala (4). It has been suggested that a successful recovery plan needs to examine the whole of the reproductive strategy and also map the genetic diversity in the surviving populations. Research into possible pests and diseases and testing the influence of weeding and fencing has also been advocated (5).

Puerto Rican parrot, red-fronted Amazon,Puerto Rican Amazon ,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Psittaciformes,Psittacidae,Amazona (1),250 – 300 g (2),So far the Puerto Rican Amazon has only narrowly escaped extinction reaching an all-time low of just 13 birds in 1975 (7). The initial and primary cause of decline was the widespread forest clearance that accompanied European settlement during the 18th and 19th Centuries (2). The bird has also suffered badly from persecution as a crop pest and hunting for food and the pet trade so that by the 1930s this previously abundant species had dramatically reduced to around 2000 individuals confined to a small range in the Luquillo Mountains (3) (6). The species then endured an ongoing decline until 1975 after which intensive conservation efforts helped it to gradually recover although efforts were hindered by the impact of Hurricane Hugo in September 1989 which reduced the population of 47 birds to 22 (2) (3). Despite recent population increases the parrot is considered Critically Endangered because its numbers still remain dangerously small (7). Currently the principle threats are competition for nest-sites loss of young to parasitic botflies (<i>Philornis pici</i>) predation by the pearly-eyed thrasher (<i>Margarops</i> <i>fuscatus</i>) and the red-tailed hawk (<i>Buteo</i> <i>jamaicensis</i>) and natural disasters such as hurricanes (7) (8). The extremely small size of the remaining population deems all threats incredibly serious (8).,In 1968 concentrated conservation efforts were begun to try to mitigate all these threats involving experiments with artificial nest-sites control of nest predators and competitors and captive breeding and <strong>re-introduction</strong> (7). The Puerto Rican Parrot Recovery\xa0Programme was begun\xa0between the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) the U.S.D.A. Forest Service and the Puerto Rico Department of Natural and Environmental Resources (DNER) (9). Captive breeding was initiated in 1973 with the creation of the Luquillo Aviary within the Caribbean National Forest (4). In 1993 this captive flock was split and a portion moved to a second aviary in Rio Abajo at the opposite end of the island in order to prevent the potential catastrophic loss of the entire captive flock due to hurricanes or disease (4) (5) (8). The captive breeding programme has experienced great success with 190 birds now living in the two breeding aviaries (4). Since May 2000 captive reared parrots have been being released into the wild to bolster the wild population with over 40 birds released to date (4). All remaining habitat is protected in the Caribbean National Forest (7) but it is nevertheless possible that a single powerful hurricane could destroy the entire wild population in their restricted range of a single mountainous valley (4). Thus exciting plans have been made by Dr. White for a huge release in 2006 into a second more protected Karst region on the opposite end of the island (4). Should this introduction be successful this rare parrot will be given an infinitely greater chance of survival and although still critically low the species\u2019 steadily increasing numbers provide a glimpse of hope for the future.

black sage, cliff manjack,Puerto Rico manjack ,Plantae,Tracheophyta,Magnoliopsida,Lamiales,Boraginaceae,Cordia (1),Height: up to 5 m (2) (3),The main threat to the Puerto Rico manjack is habitat loss and fragmentation due to residential and tourist developments on Anegada (1) (3) (9). This habitat loss is only likely to accelerate over the next few years and is compounded by other threats from road construction invasive plant species fire and trampling and grazing by introduced cattle goats and donkeys (1) (3) (9). As its highest point is no more than eight metres above sea level Anegada is also highly vulnerable to the effects of climate change and associated sea level rise (1) (6) (8).,Part of the Puerto Rico manjack\u2019s preferred limestone habitat on Anegada occurs within a designated Ramsar site (1) (10) and legislation is being prepared to declare this a protected area (1). Protected Wildlife legislation for Anegada is also being revised (1) and an action plan has been produced for the island\u2019s coastal biodiversity as part of a Darwin Initiative Project (9).

purple-barred ground-dove, purple-winged ground dove,Purple-winged ground-dove ,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Columbiformes,Columbidae,Claravis (1),Length: 19-23 cm (2),With a population estimated at just 50 to 249 mature individuals in 2003 the situation for this species is critical (2). The most significant threat to the purple-winged ground-dove is habitat loss (2) (3). Its range falls within the most important agricultural land in Brazil (3) and its habitat has therefore been subject to large-scale clearance for agricultural plantations leaving the remainder highly fragmented (2). This has led to concern that the increased distances between local bamboo flowering events and the likelihood of long periods without bamboo seed production anywhere within its range will rapidly drive the purple-winged ground-dove to extinction (2).,Although the purple-winged ground-dove has been recorded in several protected areas in Brazil and in Iguaz\xfa National Park in Argentina only small numbers have been observed and the enforcement of habitat protection in these areas is often inadequate. The current priority for this species is therefore to conduct surveys to locate additional populations and to learn more about its biology so that effective conservation strategies can be employed (2).

Competition with a number of alien plant species such as fountain grass (<em>Pennisetum setaceum</em>) on Hawaii Island is also impacting the pu\u2019u wa\u2019awa\u2019a while the beetle (<em>Physomerus grossipes</em>) poses a significant future threat on Oahu where it has recently been introduced (2).,The pu\u2019u wa\u2019awa\u2019a is listed as Endangered in the United States (6) which means that it is forbidden to remove the species from the wild and that care must be taken not to disturb its fragile habitat. A number of conservation strategies have since been put in place which should hopefully help protect this species from the threats it faces. This includes fencing plants to protect them from cattle such as on the Navy\u2019s Lualualei Naval Reservation where a program of alien plant removal is also ongoing (2) and the development of fire protection plans such as in Kanepuu Preserve on Lanai Island (2) which should reduce the threat pu\u2019u wa\u2019awa\u2019a faces from fire.

The only viable population of pygmy hogs is today restricted to Manas National Park and it is thought that possibly as few as 100 to 150 pygmy hogs remain (4). Even within the park boundaries there are threats from livestock grazing poaching and fire; whilst continued political unrest in the area severely hampers effective conservation efforts (2).,The pygmy hog is protected under Schedule I of the Wildlife (Protection) Act 1972 in India and international trade is banned by its listing on Appendix I of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) (2). Manas National Park was declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1986 (2). The Pygmy Hog Conservation Programme (PHCP) was established in 1995 under the aegis of a formal 'International Conservation Management and Reseach Agreement (ICMRA)' between the Pigs Peccaries and Hippo Specialist Group (8) of the IUCN the Durrell Wildlife Conservation Trust (9) and relevant local and national governmental authorities (2). The PHCP has carried out a multi-faceted strategy including field status surveys behavioural studies captive breeding personnel training and local community awareness and assistance programmes (2). The Pygmy Hog Research and Breeding Centre near Guwahati in Assam was established in 1996 and by the year 2000 the only captive population of this species had grown from the original six individuals to a total of 77 (2). In 2008 16 of these pygmy hogs were released into the Sonai Rupai Wildlife Reserve where they will be carefully monitored (10). The captive population is a potentially crucial insurance for keeping this small pig from extinction (2).

Although droughts and population fluctuations have been a natural occurrence throughout Raso Island\u2019s recorded history there is concern that the effects of climate change may lead to more extreme periods of drought leading to this species\u2019 extinction (2) (3).,Not only is the Raso lark a protected species under Cape Verde law but Raso Island is classified as a National Park and requires official authorisation to visit (2) (3). Unfortunately despite these regulations poor enforcement means that unofficial visits to the island by fishermen and tourists are common (3). A priority for the conservation of this species is therefore to raise awareness within the burgeoning tourist industry and amongst local fishermen of the need to preserve the island\u2019s fragile ecosystem avoiding disturbance to the habitat and preventing the introduction of alien species (2).

Animalia,Red wolf ,Animalia,Chordata,Mammalia,Carnivora,Canidae,Canis (1),20 - 35 kg (4),The population of red wolves suffered as a result of persecution and habitat loss as mature woodlands were cleared to make way for agriculture (9). Red wolves were extensively trapped and shot as they were believed to pose a direct threat to livestock and game (5). <strong>Hybridisation</strong> posed a further threat to the survival of the species as the population became increasingly fragmented; isolated individuals would crossbreed with the closely related coyote (<i>Canis latrans</i>) (10). The taxonomic status of the red wolf has been widely debated. Recent genetic and morphological research suggests that the red wolf is a unique species rather than the hybrid offspring from gray wolf (<i>Canis lupus</i>) and coyote (<i>Canis latrans</i>) <strong>interbreeding</strong> (5) (11).,Despite the ongoing debate as to the species status of the red wolf the recovery programme initiated by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service is one of the most successful large mammal conservation efforts (9). Steps to save this much-maligned species began in 1967 and culminated in the <strong>re-introduction</strong> of captive-bred individuals into the wild. Four pairs of red wolves were released in North Carolina starting in 1987 (10). A second attempt in the Great Smoky Mountains National Park in Tennessee was conducted between 1992 and 1998 but was cancelled due to the inability of wolves to establish home ranges within the park and extremely low pup survival caused by diseases from domestic dogs (4). The North Carolina population is currently doing well an amazing feat considering the species was at one time extinct in the wild. The species is fully protected within the current range (12) but educational programmes around the release areas are essential in ensuring public support and success of the <strong>re-introduction</strong>. Public opinion surveys continue to show that local regional and national support for the program is favourable (4).

These reductions were believed to be due to various factors including the fall in populations of large <strong>ungulates</strong> as a result of uncontrolled hunting disease direct persecution of the birds and developments in waste disposal meaning that carcasses were more likely to be quickly disposed of in areas of human habitation (4) (6).,Although the red-headed vulture occurs in various protected areas throughout its range these are unable protect it from diclofenac treated livestock. Fortunately the manufacture of diclofenac has now been banned in India Nepal and Pakistan and its use is being phased out and replaced with a similar drug that is not toxic to vultures. However it may be some years before the use of diclofenac completely comes to an end in these countries. It is therefore urgent that captive-breeding programs similar to those being employed for <i>Gyps </i>species be developed in order to safeguard this species from total extinction (4).

red-nosed stubfoot toad,Red-nosed stub-footed toad ,Animalia,Chordata,Amphibia,Anura,Bufonidae,Atelopus (1),Male snout-vent length: 3.9 - 4.9 cm (2)Female snout-vent length: 4.6 - 5.8 cm (2),The red-nosed stub-footed toad has undergone a drastic population decline with most populations having completely disappeared. The last recorded sighting of this species was in 1994 and subsequent surveys have failed to find any individuals (1).,Few specific conservation measures exist for the red-nosed stub-footed toad but some subpopulations are believed to occur or have occurred within the Sierra Nevada and Sierra de la Culata National Parks (1).

red tailed shark, redtail shark, redtail sharkminnow, red-tailed labeo,Redtailed black shark ,Animalia,Chordata,Actinopterygii,Cypriniformes,Cyprinidae,Epalzeorhynchos (1),Length: up to 10 cm (2),The distinctive redtailed black shark was previously believed to be extinct in the wild and was known only from captivity. The aquarium fish trade may be one of the reasons for its decline in the wild although there is not yet any evidence to support this theory. A more likely reason for the redtailed black shark\u2019s demise is habitat alteration; during the 1970s numerous dams were constructed in Thailand which probably had severe impacts on the rivers in the region. Large areas of swamps in Thailand have also been drained destroying potential habitat for the redtailed black shark (1).,Due to its popularity in the aquarium trade (tens of thousands of captive bred individuals are exported annually from Thailand) (1) the redtailed black shark\u2019s survival is probably not currently at risk.

embroidered bee-eater, embroidered honeyeater, embroidered merops, flying coachman, mock regent-bird, mock-regent honeyeater, turkeybird, warty-faced honeyeater,Regent honeyeater ,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Meliphagidae,Xanthomyza (1),Head-body length: 20.4 - 24 cm (2)Average wingspan: 30 cm (3)Male weight: 41 - 45.5 g (2)Female weight: 33 - 45 g (2),The main threat to the regent honeyeater is the loss degradation and fragmentation of Australia\u2019s native woodlands. Around 75 percent of the regent honeyeater\u2019s habitat is thought to have been cleared for agricultural or residential purposes including substantial areas of yellow box (<em>E. melliodora</em>) and white box woodlands which are particularly important to the regent honeyeater (6). The natural regeneration of these woodlands is also limited through livestock overgrazing the removal of mature seed dispersing trees and unnatural fire regimes (3). Many remnant woodlands are now heavily degraded and highly fragmented limiting the regent honeyeater\u2019s ability to move across the landscape. Woodland fragmentation also allows populations of more aggressive honeyeaters such as the noisy miner (<em>Manorina melanocephela</em>) to expand which often out-compete the regent honeyeater for foraging and nesting opportunities (6). In the face of such severe pressure the regent honeyeater population is declining and is now estimated at an alarmingly low 1500 mature individuals (4).,The regent honeyeater is described as a flagship species for the conservation of Australia\u2019s native woodlands as efforts to save this species should help conserve many other threatened species found within its habitat. As a result the regent honeyeater has received a large degree of interest and conservation objectives are outlined in a detailed recovery plan (7). Consequently timber extraction grazing and mining have all been prohibited or minimised in a number of sites that are regularly used by the species while guidelines have also been employed to ensure proper land and forestry management and to protect suitable breeding and foraging sites (6).\xa0\xa0\xa0

boshaas, bushman hare, doekvoet, pondhaas,Riverine rabbit ,Animalia,Chordata,Mammalia,Lagomorpha,Leporidae,Bunolagus (1),Length: 34 – 47 cm (2)Male weight: 1.5 kg (2)Female weight: 1.8 kg (2)Weight at birth: 40 – 50 g (2),During the last 100 years over two thirds of the riverine rabbit\u2019s habitat has been lost and today only 250 mature riverine rabbits are estimated to exist in the wild. The majority of the land in the Karoo Desert is very unfertile but the riverine rabbit occupies the flood plains of the seasonal Karoo rivers and its tributaries which are fertile and have therefore been ploughed extensively in some areas. Removal of the natural vegetation along the rivers and streams prevents the rabbit from constructing stable breeding burrows due to the loss of the soft <strong>alluvial</strong> top soils and from feeding and escaping predation (1). Overgrazing by domestic herbivores also poses a threat to the rabbits\u2019 habitat and results in habitat degradation and fragmentation (2). As rabbits and hares are adding to the menu of farm workers they are shot or trapped with gin traps (1).,The Endangered Wildlife Trust\u2019s Riverine Rabbit Working Group (EWT-RRWG) was established in August 2003 with the aim of establishing and conserving an ecosystem and socioeconomic conditions in the Karoo that can support a stable population of riverine rabbits. The EWT-RRWG achieves this through surveys research and monitoring environmental education and awareness habitat management and rehabilitation and conservation stewardship programmes. At present none of the riverine rabbit habitat is protected and the species only occurs on private Karoo farmland. Therefore the establishment of Riverine Rabbit Conservancies is an important aim for the EWT-RRWG. Conservancies are areas established by a voluntary agreement with private landowners who have riverine rabbits and potentially suitable habitat on their properties. So far three have been established in the Karoo. The conservation and management of riverine rabbit populations and their habitat is outlined in the conservancy constitution and landowners strictly control or prohibit any hunting with dogs and the use of gin traps (7). With the EWT-RRWG raising awareness of the riverine rabbit\u2019s threatened status and coordinating conservation efforts it is hoped that the risk of extinction to this rare species can be reduced.

Rodrigues fruit bat,Rodrigues flying fox ,Animalia,Chordata,Mammalia,Chiroptera,Pteropodidae,Pteropus (1),350 g (2),This species is in grave danger of extinction in the wild on Rodrigues Island as a result of habitat loss shooting and hunting for meat (5). These are believed to be the causes of its extinction in Mauritius where the species was once found in the wild. Now it is only observed there in captivity. These bats also face severe natural threats annually of tropical cyclones which blow animals out to sea where they die as well as destroy their habitats depriving them of food and shelter (4).,In 1976 the Rodrigues fruit bats were on the brink of extinction. This species\u2019 survival in the wild seemed unlikely prompting the Jersey Preservation Trust to collect 25 bats for a captive breeding project (5). This species is now part of an international Species Program (SSP) with 16 participating North American Institutes (5) and in 1992 was listed as \u2018Priority Grade 1\u2019 in the IUCN\u2019s <i>Action Plan for Old World Fruit Bats</i> putting it into the most urgent conservation category (8).

Animalia,Royal cinclodes ,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Furnariidae,Cinclodes (1),50 g (2),The royal cinclodes is under severe threat from the loss and degradation of <em>Polylepis</em> woodland which is now scarce and fragmented occupying only a fraction of its original cover. Heavy grazing and the uncontrolled use of fire have degraded understorey moss cover and prevented <em>Polylepis</em> regeneration whilst cutting of trees for timber firewood and charcoal production have further reduced available habitat (2) (3) (4) (6) (7) (9). As a result of this widespread habitat loss the royal cinclodes has been reduced to tiny subpopulations and may number fewer than 250 birds in total (2) (4) (7).,The royal cinclodes occurs in a number of protected areas including Madidi and Cotapata National Parks in Brazil (2) (4) and the Historic Sanctuary of Machu Picchu in Peru a World Heritage Site (10). A number of conservation programmes are also underway or have been proposed for the species including projects working with local communities to conserve <em>Polylepis</em> woodland; further research into the species\u2019 status ecology and distribution; environmental education and awareness campaigns; and efforts to improve land-use management (3) (4) (7). A project run by the American Bird Conservancy and the Asociaci\xf3n de Ecosistemas Andinos (ECOAN) is also aiming to restore <em>Polylepis</em> woodland and establish community protected areas covering this vulnerable habitat whilst also undertaking sustainable development projects that will benefit local people (9) (11). Despite its perilous situation these conservation efforts may go some way towards providing a brighter future for the royal cinclodes and recent records of this rare bird several hundred kilometres outside of its known range have given new hope that it may be more widespread than previously believed (4) (7) (8).

Animalia,Russian sturgeon ,Animalia,Chordata,Actinopterygii,Acipenseriformes,Acipenseridae,Acipenser (1),65 - 115 kg (2),The Russian sturgeon faces many serious threats to its survival. Vast areas of <strong>spawning</strong> ground have been lost due to the damming and exploitation of river systems throughout its range and pollution in the Caspian and Black Sea basins is causing devastating hormonal imbalances and a greater number of <strong>hermaphroditic</strong> individuals (1) (8).,Although there is a restricted sturgeon fishing season and a license to fish is necessary in most of the countries within its range the Russian sturgeon remains largely un-protected in most of the areas in which it occurs. For example the absence of a strict monitoring system makes controlling fishing very difficult. Iran has banned private sturgeon fisheries but in general conservation measures are either absent weak or ignored (1).

Although it may be tolerant of small-scale farming it is found in much higher densities near streams away from farms and so the area of optimal habitat for the species may be small. In addition much of Sagalla Hill is now covered with eucalyptus plantations in which the dry compacted soil and lack of soil <strong>invertebrates</strong> presents an unsuitable habitat for caecilians\xa0(1)\xa0(2)\xa0(4). The species is also absent from remaining natural forest at higher elevations which may either be above its natural range or have otherwise unsuitable conditions\xa0(1)\xa0(4).,Very little is currently known about this recently discovered species\xa0(4) and it does not occur in any protected areas\xa0(1)\xa0(4). However a number of conservation initiatives are in place in the region including a study into amphibian diversity\xa0(4). This caecilian is seen locally as an indicator of rich fertile soil\xa0(2) and efforts have been underway to raise its profile amongst local communities including a competition to find a name for the species in the local dialect\xa0(4) (11).

Droughts or severe winters diseases and predation pressure from wolves can also act as threats of saiga populations although these are unlikely to be major causes of the decline (10).,The saiga antelope\u2019s listing on Appendix II of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) means that any trade in this species should be carefully monitored (3). Hunting is banned throughout the saiga\u2019s range (9). Further research into saiga reproductive behaviour is needed to assess the impact of hunting and this may be used to produce an effective conservation action plan (7).

St. Croix ground lizard,Saint Croix ground lizard ,Animalia,Chordata,Reptilia,Squamata,Teiidae,Ameiva (1),Length (excluding tail): 35 – 77 mm (2),The main reasons for the disappearance of the Saint Croix ground lizard on Saint Croix Island are habitat loss and the introduction of a mammalian predator the Indian mongoose (<i>Herpestes auropunctatus</i>) both of which continue to threaten the future of the species in its remaining range (2). There is evidence that the decline on Saint Croix Island correlates with the introduction of the Indian mongoose in 1884 (2). The accidental introduction of the mongoose onto Green Protestant or Ruth Cay could be catastrophic most likely resulting in the extinction of the species (4).,Green Cay was established as a National Wildlife Refuge in 1977 by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to protect the largest remaining population of the Saint Croix ground lizard. This refuge protects 14 out of the 18 acres of designated critical habitat on Green Cay which is closed to the public keeping human disturbance to a minimum (4).

As a result its population is estimated to have declined by over 80 percent in the past 25 years (1). The forests that this monkey inhabits are being torn down for timber firewood and to cultivate rice coffee and other crops and titi groups are becoming increasingly isolated in the remaining forest fragments (1) (7) (10).,International trade in the San Martin titi monkey should be carefully regulated under this species\u2019 listing on Appendix II of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) (4).

Animalia,Santa Catalina Island rattlesnake ,Animalia,Chordata,Reptilia,Squamata,Viperidae,Crotalus (1),Snout-vent length: 68 cm (2),Once thought to be a common species the Santa Catalina Island rattlensnake has suffered declines primarily due to the killing and illegal collection of individuals; unfortunately its reported passive behaviour makes it an easy target (1).  On Santa Catalina Island \u2018pit fall\u2019 traps have been found and people have been seen collecting reptiles in bags.  In addition predation by feral cats and a decline in the Santa Catalina Island rattlesnake\u2019s main prey the deer mouse may pose a threat to this now Critically Endangered species (1).,There are currently no conservation plans in place for this highly threatened reptile.  Like many other snakes this species may receive less conservation attention than it deserves due to long-standing and fairly widespread negative attitudes towards snakes (4).  The implementation of a program to control the population of feral cats on the island has been suggested as a measure to help secure the survival of this rare and fascinating snake (1).

Newton's fiscal, São Tomé fiscal, Sao Tome fiscal shrike, Sao Tomé fiscal shrike, São Tomé fiscal shrike,Sao Tome fiscal ,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Laniidae,Lanius (1),Length: 20 – 21 cm (2),Forest clearance began on S\xe3o Tom\xe9 in the late 15th century when early colonisers made space for the cultivation of sugar cane. In the 1800s the rate of deforestation accelerated dramatically first with the production of coffee and later with cocoa. At one stage in the early 20th century S\xe3o Tom\xe9 was the world\u2019s largest producer of cocoa with an estimated 42 percent of the island being devoted to its production. The crash in the price of cocoa and the island\u2019s conversion to independence in 1975 put a stop to forest clearance but not before almost all the island\u2019s lowland <strong>primary forest</strong> had been destroyed (5). The impact of this large scale loss of habitat for the S\xe3o Tom\xe9 fiscal is plain to see with its population estimated in 2000 to be less than 50 individuals (2). While much of the cultivated land has now reverted back to <strong>secondary forest</strong> the S\xe3o Tom\xe9 fiscal appears to be restricted to the tiny remaining areas of lowland <strong>primary forest</strong>. Fortunately because these areas are so remote they are not under immediate threat but with road development opening up more and more land on the island this could very easily change in the future. Furthermore there is high probability that introduced animals such as rats monkeys weasels and civets have had a negative impact on nesting birds including the S\xe3o Tom\xe9 fiscal (2) (5).,With patches of <strong>primary forest</strong> protected within Obo Natural Park on S\xe3o Tom\xe9 it is hoped that habitat suitable for the S\xe3o Tom\xe9 fiscal will be preserved for the future. However the benefit this species derives from this protected area is unclear as its specific ecological requirements are still so poorly understood (2) (7). It is therefore paramount that further research is carried out to develop a greater understanding of this species\u2019 ecology as well as its population size and dynamics. This information will be invaluable in determining which areas should be prioritised for protection. Unfortunately as with many developing countries human and financial resources for conservation are limited and consequently at this stage law enforcement is non-existent. Nonetheless proposals have been made to actively manage and protect these areas as well as to list the S\xe3o Tom\xe9 fiscal as a protected species under national law. This is something that will become more and more crucial as development begins to encroach on the remnant patches of <strong>primary forest</strong> favoured by the S\xe3o Tom\xe9 fiscal and many other <strong>endemic</strong> species (2).

Sao Tome canary, Sao Tome goldfinch,Sao Tome grosbeak ,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Fringillidae,Neospiza (1),Length: 18 cm (2),Forest clearance began on S\xe3o Tom\xe9 in the late 15th century when early colonisers made space for the cultivation of sugar cane.

At one stage in the early 20th century S\xe3o Tom\xe9 was the world\u2019s largest producer of cocoa with an estimated 42 percent of the island being devoted to its production. The crash in the price of cocoa and the island\u2019s conversion to independence in 1975 put a stop to forest clearance but not before almost all the island\u2019s lowland primary forest had been destroyed (3). Naturally this had a devastating impact on much of the <strong>endemic</strong> wildlife including the S\xe3o Tom\xe9 grosbeak population (2) (3). Today the population is estimated at less than 50 individuals restricted to habitat under increasing pressure from land privatisation (2) (4). Furthermore road developments along the east and west coasts are increasing access to previously remote areas while introduced rats monkeys weasels and civets are all potential predators (2) (3).,Primary forest is protected as a Zona Ecologica and within Obo Natural Park but there is no law enforcement within these areas and owing to the lack of information on the S\xe3o Tom\xe9 grosbeak\u2019s ecological requirements it is not known how much it benefits from its occurrence within these areas. Fortunately this species mainly occurs in a relatively remote part of the island visited only by hunters who do not pose a threat to it. \xa0Recently the Associa\xe7\xe3o dos Bi\xf3logos Santomenses has been offering training course to the local community in order to raise awareness and involve people in the monitoring and conservation of S\xe3o Tom\xe9\u2019s <strong>endemic</strong> birds. Further research into this Critically Endangered species\u2019 population size distribution and ecological requirements is now needed to refine conservation measures. Proposals have also been made to ensure the effective protection of designated areas and to list the S\xe3o Tom\xe9 grosbeak as a protected species under national law (2) (5).

Vu Quang Ox,Saola ,Animalia,Chordata,Mammalia,Cetartiodactyla,Bovidae,Pseudoryx (1),80 - 100 kg (3),After its relatively recent discovery the saola is now the focus of attention for another reason - its grave danger of extinction. The species has a small range where it is increasingly threatened by habitat loss and especially hunting and snaring (1). Hunters intensively pursue animals valued in traditional East Asian \u2018medicine\u2019 and the local bushmeat trades and although the saola itself apparently has limited value and is not pursued aggressively it is killed incidentally in the pursuit of other species. In the past hunters have also tried to capture the saola because of the intense interest in this new and strange species (3). Sadly the more than a dozen saola known to have been captured and held in captivity were all poorly kept and with the exception of two that were quickly released into the wild all died within days or weeks or at most five months of their capture (2) (7). None are in captivity anywhere in the world today. As of November 2010 the most recent confirmed record of the species was an adult male captured by villagers in northern Laos in August 2010 and held by them for several days before it too died (9).\xa0,The saola is found in a number of protected areas in which conservation initiatives have been implemented. In Vietnam in the Vu Quang Nature Reserve where the saola was first discovered the Ministry of Forestry has cancelled its logging operations (8) and surveys and other conservation activities have also been conducted in the Pu Huong Nature Reserve in cooperation with Vietnam's Vinh University (7). Furthermore within the Pu Mat National Park many surveys on the distribution and ecology of the saola were carried out between 1998 and 2003 as part of the Social Forestry and Nature Conservation project (7). The Ministry of Forestry in Vietnam has also issued a ban on further capture trade or holding of this rare animal given its apparent inability to survive captivity (2).\xa0

Gobemouche paradis noir,Seychelles paradise-flycatcher ,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Muscicapidae,Terpsiphone (1),Length: 20 cm (2),Habitat destruction has been the major cause of the deleterious decline in paradise flycatcher numbers (2). Suitable forests on La Digue have been cleared to make way for tourist and private development (2) and for coconut plantations (3). Recently a disease affecting takamaka trees has provided further cause for concern (2).,In 1981 a small area of mature woodland habitat was designated as a reserve areas of standing water have been created and public awareness programmes put into action (2). The remnant populations on additional islands require further investigation as to whether they are viable (2). Encouragingly the population on La Digue has recently shown a marked increase and may be more adaptable than was previously feared; <strong>territories</strong> have been found in woodland near to housing developments (2).

Animalia,Seychelles sheath-tailed bat ,Animalia,Chordata,Mammalia,Chiroptera,Emballonuridae,Coleura (1),Head-body length: 55 – 65 mm (2)Male weight: 10.2 g (2)Female weight: 11.1 g (2),The Seychelles sheath-tailed bat has been lost from the majority of islands where it was originally found. The precise cause of this dramatic decline is unclear; it has been speculated that introduction of the predatory barn owl (<i>Tyto alba</i>) and declines in insect availability resulting from use of pesticides may be involved (3). However the recent discovery of a second roost near marshes on Silhouette showed that the bats here feed on different insects than those eaten by roosts that forage in palm woodlands elsewhere (4). It has therefore been argued that this variability in the diet demonstrates that food is not a limiting factor for the species and the decline in the species may rather be attributable to habitat alteration caused by invasive plants obstructing roost entrances (4).,The Nature Protection Trust of the Seychelles has monitored the known population of Seychelles sheath-tailed bats since 1997 (5) (6). As with other bats the protection of roosts and foraging habitat are of great importance. Existing roosts must be preserved not only from human disturbance but also from introduced plant species that smother the cave entrances (4). To this end one roost site had the invasive Kudzu vine <i>Pueraria phaesolides</i> cut back from its entrance in 2001 and 2004 and ongoing management aims to completely remove the species from the area (4). It is hoped that removal of invasive creepers from existing and abandoned roost sites will help to increase the desperately low numbers of this critically endangered bat to more sustainable levels.

Lophornis brachylopha,Short-crested coquette ,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Apodiformes,Trochilidae,Lophornis (1),Length: 7 cm (2),Although there is a lack of data for this species the population of the short-crested coquette is believed to be in decline. Due to its restricted range this species is particularly sensitive to human disturbance such as habitat destruction (2). In the early 1990s <strong>semi-deciduous</strong> forest between Paraiso and Nueva Delhi was cleared to allow small-holder farming of maize coffee and fruit. Estimating the extent of the resulting habitat loss and degradation has been problematic as the remaining forest provides cover for the growth of illegal drugs (2).,The short-crested coquette is listed on Appendix II of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) which serves to regulate the trade in this species (3)<warehouse:ref entitytype="ScientificReference"></warehouse:ref>.

Crocodile Du Siam,Siamese crocodile ,Animalia,Chordata,Reptilia,Crocodylia,Crocodylidae,Crocodylus (1),Male length: 3 m (2),Siamese crocodiles are under threat from human disturbance and habitat occupation which is forcing remaining populations to the edges of their former range (5). The conversion of rainforest habitat to agricultural use along with aggressive hunting for crocodile skins have contributed to the decline of this species of crocodile (5). In Cambodia which is the species' last remaining stronghold incursion into pristine habitat is now occurring through aid development programs and the hunting of adult females for crocodile farm stock is reported to be widespread (2).,Until recently very little data existed on Siamese crocodile numbers and distribution a factor which led to the species being reported as virtually extinct in the wild in 1992 (5). Since then a large amount of research has been conducted and this has shown a slightly more encouraging picture although the status is still hard to judge. Siamese crocodiles appear to be mainly found in Cambodia where updated estimates suggest a population of no greater than 5000 individuals (2) though it may be considerably less (5). However the species is extensively maintained and bred in captivity in both Thailand and Cambodia where it is farmed for the commercial value of its skins (2). The species is considered relatively inoffensive to humans making restocking programmes a distinct possibility provided sufficient habitat is maintained and protected. Local people have been reported to protect crocodiles which they view to be sacred (2). Programs are already underway in Thailand (2) and although the future of the Siamese crocodile remains in the balance there is more optimism than a decade ago.

Siberian white crane, snow crane,Siberian crane ,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Gruiformes,Gruidae,Leucogeranus (1),4.9 - 8.6 kg (2),Main threats include habitat loss and degradation in the wintering grounds migratory stopover sites and breeding grounds. The construction of the Three Gorges Dam and the resulting hydrological changes to the lower Yangtze River is likely to have a major impact on the wintering population (6). Human pressures throughout the range are increasing and drainage agricultural development oil extraction and development are identified risks (7). Hunting in Pakistan and Afghanistan is a concern (6) and the recent war in Afghanistan is also thought to have affected migrating cranes (8). At present the populations are so small that they are vulnerable to chance events such as an outbreak of disease or extreme weather conditions genetic problems may arise as a result of increased <strong>inbreeding</strong> and the structure of the population in terms of sex-ratio and age may become skewed leading to further problems (7).,The Siberian crane is legally protected in all the countries in which it occurs and is protected from international trade by its listing on Appendix I of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) (6). Conservation of this species began in the 1970s and a number of protected areas have been established at key sites and migratory stopovers in Russia China Pakistan and India. Educational programmes have been carried out in India Pakistan and Afghanistan. Three captive-breeding facilities have been set up and a number of releases have been made (7) particularly to augment the central population (6). Research into the species is ongoing and current efforts are attempting to establish an International Siberian Crane Recovery Team and a Recovery Plan for the species (7).

Plantae,Sicilian fir ,Plantae,Tracheophyta,Coniferopsida,Coniferales,Pinaceae,Abies (1),Height: 10 - 15 m (2)Trunk diameter: 40 - 60 cm (2),The Sicilian fir was already severely reduced by the beginning of the 19th Century as a result of extensive logging for timber and firewood (3). This species appears to be facing competition from the beech <i>Fagus sylvatica</i> which may be more adaptable to climatic changes. A reduction in deep soil following deforestation could also have played a part in the decline of the Sicilian fir (2). The small numbers of firs remaining are now at an inherent risk from any chance event and fire poses a particular danger.,The Sicilian fir has been the subject of a concerted conservation programme to protect this rare and unique local species. The remaining wild trees occur within a Regional Park; grazing and visitor numbers in the valley are carefully controlled and the trees are monitored and fenced off (3). In addition an <glos><i>ex-situ</i></glos> conservation programme has been established and has produced around 110000 trees that are available for replanting. To date replanting efforts have met with little success but scientists at the University of Palermo are investigating this species\u2019 optimum ecological conditions in an effort to rectify this (3). The rare Sicilian fir is a flagship species for the wealth of <strong>endemic</strong> flora found on this island (3).

Propithecus diadema candidus,Silky sifaka ,Animalia,Chordata,Mammalia,Primates,Indriidae,Propithecus (1),5 – 6.5 kg (2),With an estimated 250 mature individuals remaining in the wild (1) the silky sifaka is one of the three rarest lemurs in all of Madagascar (4). Habitat destruction and hunting are the primary threats that have brought the silky sifaka to this perilous position and continue to threaten the future survival of this species. Habitat destruction such as <strong>slash-and-burn</strong> agriculture logging and mining takes place even within so-called protected areas and (7) unfortunately with such activities often comes improved infrastructure such as roads augmenting hunting opportunities (1). Sadly unlike several sifakas no taboos against hunting this species exist and many people in Madagascar view wild lemur meat as a delicacy (7).\xa0\xa0 \xa0,The silky sifaka is present in a few protected areas: the Anjanaharibe-Sud Special Reserve Marojejy National Park and more rarely the Anjanaharibe and Manandriana portions of the Makira Protected Area\xa0 (1) (7). Marojejy National Park forms part of the World Heritage Site \u2018The Rainforests of the Atsinanana\u2019 for which the silky sifaka is a flagship species (7) (8). It has been recommended that other areas of forest where the silky sifaka has been recorded should be protected (1). However as mentioned above the designation of protected areas does not always provide this Critically Endangered sifaka with the absolute protection it requires. A lack of awareness and understanding amongst local people of this sifaka\u2019s rarity and uniqueness is one obstacle in conservation efforts and as a result a conservation education programme took place in 2004 with encouraging results; many local people were interested in learning more about this species and showed concern for its plight (4).

Further changes to the climate caused by human activities may result in even greater reductions in the available habitat for this species (1).,The Sinai baton blue occurs entirely within the St Katherine Protectorate where rangers are monitoring this species by carrying out 9 to 14 survey days each year (7). Recent conservation efforts for the Sinai baton blue are mainly focused on preserving its endangered host plant with the Protectorate recently banning the collection of Sinai thyme with enforced fines. A fence has also been erected around a patch containing the largest butterfly population to prevent public access and stop further plant loss. Two dams have been built in this patch to hold more water in the soil and improve the condition of the thyme (1) (8).

Courlis à bec grèle,Slender-billed curlew ,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Charadriiformes,Scolopacidae,Numenius (1),Length: 36 - 41 cm (2),The decline in the population of slender-billed curlews may have been due to the extensive hunting of waders for food in the latter half of the 19<sup>th</sup>and early 20th Century. Curlews were a prime target due to their large size and slender-billed curlews may be tamer than other species making them easy targets (8). The threat of hunting remains and the continued loss and degradation of wetlands in the Mediterranean and North Africa as well as in the breeding and staging areas is also a serious threat (7). Population estimates made in 2000 put the number of slender-billed curlew at fewer than 50 individuals (7).,The slender-billed curlew is protected in the majority of range states through which it passes and is listed on Appendix I of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) (7). It is also listed on Appendix I of the Convention on Migratory Species (CMS) under which a Slender-billed Curlew Working Group (SbCWG) has been established in the framework of a \u2018CMS Memorandum of Understanding\u2019 for the species (5) (9). The group works to allow the cooperation of scientists and governments for the conservation of this species (9) and BirdLife International produced an Action Plan for the conservation of this species in 1996 (8).

Gyps indicus tenuirostris,Slender-billed vulture ,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Falconiformes,Accipitridae,Gyps (1),Length: 80 – 95 cm (2),Having suffered an extremely rapid decline in numbers due to a previously unknown cause the slender-billed vulture is in danger of imminent extinction without immediate conservation action. By 2000 dead and dying <i>Gyps</i> vultures were being found so frequently in Nepal and India it was thought that they were suffering from an epidemic. The unnaturally high death toll was thought to be caused by a fatal virus but testing has revealed that the vultures were suffering from kidney failure following the consumption of cattle that had previously been treated with the anti-inflammatory drug diclofenac (2). In fact the decline is a result of a lethal level of the drug in a small proportion of the <strong>ungulate</strong> carcasses available to vultures but as vultures travel long distances to reach <strong>carrion</strong> a considerable proportion of the population has been affected (7).,It is necessary to prevent exposure of vultures to livestock carcasses that have been contaminated with diclofenac and to find an alternative replacement drug (7). Government commitment to the control of the use of the drug is crucial but until it has been entirely removed from the environment a collaboration of bird protection organisations plan to take all slender-billed vultures into captivity for the next 20 to 30 years to avoid further deaths which would further reduce the chance of a successful recovery of this already rare species (8).

Accidentally caught sawfish are rarely returned to the water alive as they are difficult to disentangle from nets and are dangerous to fishermen. Sawfish are purposefully caught for sport for food and for their oil which is used to make soap medicine and for polishing leather as well as for their saws which are removed and sold as curios. Habitat modification is also contributing to the decline of this species which is slow to recover from population crashes due to slow maturation and a long reproductive cycle (1) (2) (3).,Florida has established three wildlife refuges to protect the habitat of the smalltooth sawfish and in the hope that numbers might increase sufficiently for re-colonisation of other areas (3). It has been protected from harvesting in Florida since 1992 and over the rest of American waters since 2003 (5). Research into smalltooth sawfish life-history and population distribution as well as education and awareness initiatives may help to prevent further decline of this species but these efforts must be made worldwide to ensure the protection of this amazing fish (6).

Sociable plover,Sociable lapwing ,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Charadriiformes,Charadriidae,Vanellus (1),Length: 27 – 30 cm (2),The cause of the recent decline in sociable lapwing numbers is unknown but it has been suggested that their habitat may have been changed after a reduction in grazing by large herds of native <strong>ungulates</strong> and domestic cattle. This species increasingly breeds near villages where conversion of the land to farmland is imminent and where additional threats such as predation by domestic animals are more likely. A further concern is the substantial increase in numbers of a predator of the sociable lapwing the rook <i>Corvus frugilegus</i>. Finally both the breeding and wintering grounds of this species have become drier which may be disrupting prey organism availability (2).,The sociable lapwing is legally protected in Armenia Kazakhstan Russia Turkmenistan Ukraine and Uzbekistan. Plans to survey the bird\u2019s movements in Kazakhstan should help to identify key threats. Protecting grassland <strong>steppe</strong> habitats regulating livestock numbers and managing colonies during the nesting period are all key aims in plans to conserve this species (2).

Thon Rouge du Sud,Southern bluefin tuna ,Animalia,Chordata,Actinopterygii,Perciformes,Scombridae,Thunnus (1),up to 158 kg (2),The southern bluefin tuna has been heavily exploited over the years and has been fished to the brink of extinction (6). During the 1960s the annual catch was around 80000 tonnes worldwide (5). The flesh of this species has a particularly high fat content and is prized in Japan especially for 'sashimi' markets (5) where an individual fish can fetch as much as US$ 10000 (4). Fishing mainly takes the form of <strong>purse seine netting</strong> in Australia (6) and longline fishing in the other range states; namely New Zealand Japan the Republic of Korea Taiwan and Indonesia (5).,In 1994 Australia Japan and New Zealand signed the Convention for the Conservation of Southern Bluefin Tuna in an attempt to curb the overfishing of this species (5). The Commission for the Conservation of the Southern Bluefin Tuna (CCSBT) has subsequently formed and in 2001 was joined by the Republic of Korea (5). The objective of the Commission is to ensure the conservation and optimum utilisation of the global southern bluefin tuna fishery through management measures including reduced fishing quotas and research (5). Some scientists and conservationists are worried however that the Commission does not go far enough and that global breeding stocks having been reduced by as much as 97% will require more drastic measures if they are ever to recover (6).

Pyxide Arachnoide, Tortue-araignée,Spider tortoise ,Animalia,Chordata,Reptilia,Testudines,Testudinidae,Pyxis (1),Average shell length: 11.1 (2),This species\u2019 habitat has been seriously degraded with an estimated 1.2 percent loss in habitat per year. The main causes of habitat loss and degradation in Madagascar include human-caused fires conversion to agriculture charcoal production firewood exploitation and invasive alien plants (1) (11). Madagascar\u2019s burgeoning human population can only cause this problem to worsen (11).,The Critically Endangered spider tortoise is protected by national law in Madagascar and listed on Appendix I of CITES which prohibits international trade in this species. Unfortunately compliance with the law is proving difficult to enforce with large numbers leaving the country illegally to support the exotic pet trade (4) (5) as well as being hunted for food by certain communities within Madagascar. The spider tortoise\u2019s occurrence in two protected areas (Lake Tsimanampetsotsa National Park and Cap Sainte-Marie Special Reserve) offers some much needed protection but owing to a lack of resources within the protected areas system habitat destruction and poaching still continues (4) (14). The need for a specific conservation action plan has been raised in addition to stricter measures to protect its habitat and the implementation of education programmes to try and protect this tortoise from hunting (9).\xa0These measures in addition to ensuring that populations of all <strong>subspecies</strong> are represented within protected areas (1) (15) are essential if the long-term survival of the spider tortoise is to be assured.

little blue macaw,Spix’s macaw ,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Psittaciformes,Psittacidae,Cyanopsitta (1),Length: 55 - 57 cm (2),It is thought that the destruction of caraiba forest and other human activities over the last 500 years are largely responsible for the decline of the Spix\u2019s macaw. More recently trapping for the illegal bird trade has driven this parrot to extinction in the wild (4) (5).,Until 2001 the Spix\u2019s macaw recovery programme was coordinated and implemented through the Permanent Committee for the Recovery of the Spix\u2019s Macaw (CPRAA) composed of the Brazilian government scientific advisors and Spix\u2019s macaw holders (4). While the solitary male remained in the wild he was the subject of a number of study programmes and valuable information on the natural ecology and behaviour of this species was obtained (4). The wild male had mated with a blue-winged macaw (<em>Primoliismaracana</em>) and the pair successfully fostered blue-winged macaw nestlings which were introduced to them (4). This is an encouraging finding as wild blue-winged macaws could in theory be used to foster captive-bred Spix\u2019s macaws in the same way (4). The future of Spix\u2019s macaw depends on the success of the captive-bred population and its possible reintroduction into the wild. There have been recent problems however leading the Brazilian government to suspend CPRAA in 2001 due to internal conflicts (7). While the loss of Spix\u2019s macaw in the wild was a devastating blow to the conservation programme if the different parties can cooperate there is hope that a wild population of Spix\u2019s macaws can be successfully reintroduced.

spoonbill sandpiper,Spoon-billed sandpiper ,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Charadriiformes,Scolopacidae,Eurynorhynchus (1),Length: 14 – 16 cm (2),With very particular habitat requirements high nest site fidelity and a small population habitat loss has had a large impact on this species. As with many coastal regions tidal mudflats are being reclaimed for industry or aquaculture. Pollution climate change and human disturbance have also altered the habitat of this species and hunting of shorebirds contributes to the decline of the spoon-billed sandpiper. Recent population surveys indicate an extremely rapid decline in this species with reduced productivity leading to fears that the population is ageing rapidly (2).,The spoon-billed sandpiper is protected in several areas throughout its range but would benefit from enforced legal protection wherever it is present. Shorebird hunting is prolific and affects many species; a ban would have wide-ranging benefits. A Species Action Plan was produced for the spoon-billed sandpiper in 2008 but urgent conservation action is now required to prevent its extinction (2).

Animalia,Spotted handfish ,Animalia,Chordata,Actinopterygii,Lophiiformes,Brachionichthyidae,Brachionichthys (1),Length: 10 - 15 cm (2),The spotted handfish was common in the lower Derwent River estuary until the mid 1980s when the species underwent a catastrophic decline (2). Although unproven it is thought that the introduction of the northern Pacific seastar (<i>Asterias amurensis</i>) to Tasmania at this time may be the key to the decimation of the handfish population (3). These seastars are voracious predators of shellfish and it is thought that they may also eat the eggs of handfish or the sea squirts upon which the eggs are attached (2). The deterioration of coastal habitats due to development may also be involved in the decline (3). This species is under added threat from its vastly reduced population limited dispersal restricted distribution and low reproductive rate (3).,Just two spotted handfish were reported between 1990 and 1994; this dire state of the population led to the formation of the Spotted Handfish Recovery Team in 1996 (3). The Recovery Team consists of a number of government agencies concerned with saving this rare and bizarre fish. Research into existing wild populations and the development of captive breeding techniques are some of the priorities of the recovery plan (3). Initial work has been encouraging with successful breeding attempts from two adult pairs of spotted handfish at the Tasmanian Department of Primary Industry and Fisheries Aquaculture (2). A captive population may be used in a future <strong>re-introduction</strong> programme to restore these fish to some of their previous range (6).

Plantae,St Helena boxwood ,Plantae,Tracheophyta,Magnoliopsida,Solanales,Solanaceae,Mellissia (1),Height: 1 - 2 m (2),The island of St Helena has suffered over 450 years of human exploitation and has come to symbolise the environmental collapse of the world's oceanic islands. Today the landscape is altered beyond recognition and many of the <strong>endemic</strong> and unique species have been lost for ever (5). The introduction of goats and other livestock as well as the clearing of native forests for timber have ravaged the island; 60 percent of St Helena became barren ground known as the Crown Wastes following massive soil erosion (5). The St Helena boxwood appears to contain toxins that prevented it from being damaged by goats and therefore widespread erosion is likely to have been the main cause of its disappearance from the island (2).,Today all that survives of the St Helena boxwood are a precarious wild population and around 50 cultivated plants many situated at the Royal Botanic Gardens Kew in the UK (4). It is hoped that some of these will be returned to St Helena and <strong>re-introduced</strong> to the wild however early attempts at <strong>re-introduction</strong> have not proven successful and there is a lack of expertise on the island itself (4). Recent studies have revealed that there is no genetic variation amongst the remaining plants of this species providing a further predicament to the conservation drive as individuals will be less adaptable and more likely to succumb to pests (4).

Plantae,St Helena ebony ,Plantae,Tracheophyta,Magnoliopsida,Malvales,Sterculiaceae,Trochetiopsis (1),Height: up to 4 - 5 m (2),The native flora and fauna of St Helena have suffered centuries of exploitation and many of the <strong>endemic</strong> and unique species have been lost. The most striking example of the devastation that has occurred is an area known as the Crown Wastes a barren ground that has suffered massive erosion and covers 60 percent of the island (5). The St Helena ebony was once common in this area which stands as a pertinent warning of the effects of over-exploitation. Goats were introduced to the island in the early 16th Century in order to provide food for sailors passing through the area (4). Vast herds of wild goats roamed the island and fed on native plants such as the ebony; the low branches of this species made it highly accessible and seedlings were particularly vulnerable thus preventing population growth (4).,The St Helena ebony has proven easy to propagate and cuttings taken from the two remaining wild shrubs have been used to cultivate plants as part of the conservation programme for this species (4). Wild goats have been all but removed from the island following a concerted campaign in the 1960s (4). The ebony has been established in cultivation at two key sites: behind High Peak (not formerly within the range of the ebony) and Ebony Plain although limited regeneration has been observed at either site (3). There are currently around 2000 individuals (3) but these were all derived from the two remaining plants and subsequently have little genetic variation (4). At both sites the Ebony is planted with the hybrid <i>Trochetiopsis x benjaminii</i> Cronk also known as \u2018Rebony\u2019 and <strong>introgression</strong> is a possible threat (3). Smaller collections have been established at Scotland Pounceys and White\u2019s Cottage (Norman Williams Nature Reserve); in the latter two sites the hybrid is also planted (3). In addition the ebony is also in cultivation in private gardens usually derived from clonal material of the upper cliff plant (3). These cultivated populations are a mere shadow of the former glory of this species.

Saint Helena plover, wirebird,St Helena plover ,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Charadriiformes,Charadriidae,Charadrius (1),Length: 15 cm (2),As a result of land management changes and introduced predators the population of the St Helena plover is critically low. A census carried out during 2005 and 2006 showed that this species had undergone a decline of more that 40 percent in just five years to a mere 235 individuals (3). There has since been a small increase in numbers however (6). The major factor suspected of causing the decline is a reduction in livestock grazing which has become unprofitable (2) and has led to longer grass swards and encroachment by shrubland (3). This is detrimental to breeding success as the birds rely on short swards in which to construct nests and forage. In addition to this threat growing populations of introduced predators are consuming large numbers of this species\u2019 eggs and chicks. To compound these existing problems there are now plans to build an airport on St Helena potentially reducing available habitat and causing further disturbance and degradation due to tourist activity. With its population currently at the lowest level ever recorded the St Helena plover is perilously close to extinction and will require careful management to ensure its survival (3).,Protected by law on St Helena since 1894 in recent years the plight of the St Helena plover has galvanised a significant amount of attention from researchers and conservationists (2) (3). Even the plan to construct the airport on St Helena has had some positive impact as it has reinforced efforts to find out more about this threatened bird\u2019s status and how it can be preserved (3). The airport mitigation process has also provided resources to allow restoration of some degraded but formerly important grassland habitat (6).

Plantae,St Helena rosemary ,Plantae,Tracheophyta,Magnoliopsida,Rhamnales,Rhamnaceae,Phylica (1),Height: up to 3 m (2),The island of St Helena has undergone a dramatic loss of native fauna and flora following centuries of exploitation; over 60% of the island has suffered massive erosion or is colonised by introduced plant species (3). Although there are around 100 rosemary plants remaining these are mainly in small highly fragmented and genetically distinct populations. Growing on or below rock outcrops the populations are vulnerable to chance factors and to competition from introduced plants. No regeneration has been observed at the High Hill site in the last 10 years (4).,The Environmental Conservation Section nursery at Scotland St Helena has raised a number of plants of St Helena rosemary and some of these have been planted out in private gardens to aid their survival (2).

Animalia,Staghorn coral ,Animalia,Cnidaria,Anthozoa,Scleractinia,Acroporidae,Acropora (1),,Staghorn corals face the many threats that are impacting coral reefs globally. At present around one third of the world's reef-building corals are threatened with extinction. The principal threat to corals is the rise in sea temperature associated with global climate change. This leads to coral bleaching where the symbiotic algae are expelled leaving the corals weak and vulnerable to an increasing variety of harmful diseases. Climate change is also expected cause more extreme weather incidents and to increase ocean acidification which impairs the coral's ability to form a skeleton. These global threats are compounded by localised threats from pollution destructive fishing practices invasive species and human development (6).,Staghorn corals are listed on Appendix II of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) and therefore trade in this coral should be carefully regulated and a permit is required to bring the coral or objects made from them into the countries that have signed the CITES convention (2). Staghorn corals will also form part of the marine community in many marine protected areas or in areas where management plans are in place to protect the coral community. In some areas coral reefs restoration attempts are being undertaken; in Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary efforts have been made to reattach coral fragments or culture and settle coral larvae. Both activities have had limited success and new techniques are being pursued (5).

star sturgeon,Stellate sturgeon ,Animalia,Chordata,Actinopterygii,Acipenseriformes,Acipenseridae,Acipenser (1),Length: up to 2.18 metres (2),The major threat to the stellate sturgeon\u2019s survival is overfishing for its meat and more significantly for caviar sold under the name \u201csevruga\u201d. This is produced from the sturgeon\u2019s unfertilised eggs and is almost always extracted by killing the female. The caviar industry is currently in crisis as the dwindling stocks of the stellate sturgeon and the other major caviar producing species can no longer provide sufficient caviar to meet the huge worldwide demand (2). Despite attempts to manage stellate sturgeon stocks illegal fishing and black market trade in caviar are threatening to drive this already endangered species to extinction (2) (7).,In 1998 the stellate sturgeon was listed by the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) meaning that all international trade in this species is controlled by maximum export quotas and trade permits (2) (3). The countries which are party to the CITES agreement must agree on sustainable catch and export quotas based on scientific surveys and must adopt regional conservation strategies and attempt to combat illegal fishing. The strict enforcement of these regulations meant that in 2006 caviar export was banned for all of the countries bordering the Caspian Sea since the countries failed to provide sufficient information about the sustainability of their catch. This promoted an agreement between the countries to reduce their stellate sturgeon caviar export quotas in 2007 by over 25 percent (8). The countries bordering the Black Sea have adopted an even stricter policy regarding their sturgeon stocks maintaining a zero quota policy which has continued into 2008 (9). Whether these reduced quotas will prove sufficient to allow the stellate sturgeon\u2019s population to recover remains to be seen.

It is currently known from only a handful of locations; however due to the extended period in which the larval shrimp are thought to remain in the <strong>plankton</strong> passively floating in oceanic currents it is possible that Sterrer\u2019s cave shrimp will be discovered in new areas of suitable habitat within the Caribbean region (4). \xa0,There are currently no conservation measures underway targeting this little-known shrimp (1). As Sterrer\u2019s cave shrimp is restricted to such a specific habitat affording adequate protection to the caves in which it is found may be deemed a high priority for its conservation.

Indeed adult striped narrow-headed softshell turtles are prized as status symbol pets in Thailand where commercial breeding farms have often taken dozens of animals from the wild without producing a single captive-bred hatchling (6).,The striped narrow-headed softshell turtle is given national protection in Indonesia under the law on Conservation of Biological Natural Resources and their Ecosystems.\xa0This prohibits utilisation of the species in any form except with special permission for circumstances such as research or captive breeding. In Thailand this turtle is specifically protected under the Wild Animals Reservation and Protection ACT (WARPA) which controls hunting trade possession import export and commercial breeding of wildlife (6).

Animalia,Sulu hornbill ,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Coraciiformes,Bucerotidae,Anthracoceros (1),Length: 50 cm (2),The islands of the Sulu archipelago escaped large-scale deforestation until the end of the 20th Century (2). Today however the islands of Jolo and Sanga-sanga have been almost completely logged and have consequently suffered the local extinction of the Sulu hornbill (5). Logging in Tawitawi has also caused the deleterious decline of the species in its final stronghold. Hunting has also been a major cause of the destruction of this species; nestlings are collected annually for food and adults are reportedly shot on site either for food or target practice (5). The tiny population of Sulu hornbills that remain is on the verge of extinction; political unrest in the region continues to hamper conservation efforts (2).,The Sulu hornbill does not currently occur within any protected areas (4) and is in grave danger of disappearing before it has been properly studied. Research into the life history and biology of this rare bird are urgently needed along with survey work and protection measures (2). The Sulu hornbill is listed on Appendix II of the Conventional on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) and the Mindano State University have carried out some public awareness campaigns (5). Time is running out however and the Sulu hornbill may soon receive the dubious accolade of being the be the first hornbill to become extinct in the 21st Century (5).

Sumatran orang-utan,Sumatran orangutan ,Animalia,Chordata,Mammalia,Primates,Hominidae,Pongo (1),Female: 40 - 50 kg (2)Male: 60 - 90 kg (2)Female head-body length: 78 cm (2)Male head-body length: 97 cm (2),Orangutans were hunted relentlessly throughout the majority of their South East Asian range their large size and slow movements making them easy targets for hunters (8). However the main threat to orangutans today is loss of habitat (7). In the past twenty years 80 percent of orangutan habitat has been lost to illegal logging gold mining and conversion to permanent agriculture in particular palm oil plantations. What is special about these animals is their unique vulnerability to exploitation. Much of this may be attributed to their extremely long inter-birth interval typically eight years making them the slowest breeding primates on earth (7).,The Sumatran orangutan is fully protected by law in Indonesia and is listed on Appendix I of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) which bans international trade in this species. The key to saving this species is protecting tracts of unexploited forest that are interconnected and contain sufficient habitat (8). A massive national park has been proposed in the north of Sumatra covering 25000 square kilometres and encompassing the existing Gunung Leuser National Park. The Leuser ecosystem will play a key role in protecting important refuges of the critically endangered Sumatran rhino (<i>Dicerorhinus sumatrensis</i>) elephant (<i>Elephas maximus sumatranus</i>) and tiger (<i>Panthera tigris sumatrae</i>) as well as the orangutan and numerous lesser-known species (8). Due to the large home ranges that these apes require it is the protection of habitat that will ensure that these beautiful and enigmatic 'people of the forest' survive into the next century (7).

Rhinocéros De Sumatra,Sumatran rhinoceros ,Animalia,Chordata,Mammalia,Perissodactyla,Rhinocerotidae,Dicerorhinus (1),up to 1,000 kg (2),The Sumatran rhinoceros was driven from large regions of its former range as a result of the habitat destruction and hunting (2). Today the small isolated populations that remain continue to be primarily threatened by poaching (1) as sadly the Sumatran rhinoceros is one of the unfortunate animals that is highly valued in traditional Asian medicines. Many parts of its body are believed to have aphrodisiac and medicinal properties but its distinctive horn is most in demand and ends up either a powdered ingredient in medicines or artistically carved (2) (5). The populations of the Sumatran rhinoceros are now so small that breeding has become a rare activity and successful births are infrequent; as a result <strong>inbreeding depression</strong> has become a real and serious risk (1). The small numbers mean that even the death of a single animal brings the species a step closer to extinction (5).,Despite being listed on Appendix I of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) since 1975 (which prohibits trade in the species) (3) and being legally protected in all the countries in which it occurs (1) the Sumatran rhinoceros is still in a precarious situation. International efforts to prevent poaching of this rare species are underway (1) and their success is imperative if this species is to survive.

Malayan pangolin,Sunda pangolin ,Animalia,Chordata,Mammalia,Pholidota,Manidae,Manis (1),4.5 - 14 kg (2),The primary threat to the <em>Sunda pangolin</em>\xa0is hunting and poaching (1). In parts of Asia the flesh of pangolins is considered a delicacy and powdered pangolin scales are thought to hold high medicinal and aphrodisiacal qualities despite being made of keratin the same substance found in human nails and hair (4) (8). The Sunda pangolin is also threatened by the widespread habitat loss that has occurred throughout its range (1) (7).,The Sunda pangolin is listed on Appendix II of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) which means that international trade in this species is strictly regulated (3). This species is protected by wildlife laws in Myanmar Thailand Cambodia Vietnam Indonesia Singapore and Malaysia which are all regions where it is threatened by hunting although these laws are often not enforced to an appropriate degree (1).

The spread of alien vegetation and in particular the planting of exotic pines gums and poplars has resulted in the clogging of streams creating areas of stagnant water unsuitable for the Table Mountain ghost frog. Consequently even within its restricted range it has become locally extinct along certain stretches. Other potential threats include the construction of dams which reduce water flow frequent fires global climate change and intensive eco-tourism while in recent years the deadly fungal disease chytridiomycosis has been found in some populations of this Critically Endangered species (1) (2) (3).,The whole of the Table Mountain ghost frog\u2019s range is incorporated within the Table Mountain National Park itself a part of the Cape Floristic World Heritage Site (1) (4). Given this species imperilled conservation status Western Cape Nature Conservation also has a monitoring programme in place (1). One of the main conservation priorities is to ensure the preservation of swift-flowing perennial mountain streams on Table Mountain. Furthermore with the looming threat of further cases of chytridiomycosis spreading through the population the establishment of a captive population may prove vital to this species survival (2) (3).

Tahiti flycatcher,Tahiti monarch ,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Monarchidae,Pomarea (1),Length: 15 cm (2),The Tahiti monarch used to be common throughout the island but during the last century populations underwent a dramatic decrease and now number less than 50 restricted to a few valleys. These perilous declines have largely been the result of the accidental introduction of the black rat (<i>Rattus rattus</i>) to the island which prey on the eggs and chicks. However two introduced birds the Indian mynah and red-vented bulbul also pose a significant threat to the monarch\u2019s survival. It is thought that the Indian mynah which was introduced to control wasps preys on eggs and chicks whereas the red-vented bulbul competes with the monarch for nest sites and territories (5).,In 1997 the total population was only 27 individuals. Since then a conservation programme was implemented and intensive surveys revealed the population had increased to 40 to 45 birds in 2004 (2) (3). The recovery plan is largely focused on the control of the black rat. During each breeding season a rat-baiting programme takes place on accessible Tahiti monarch territories (12 territories in 2006); the remainder live in remote areas that are extremely difficult to access. Trees which hold Tahiti monarch nests are fitted with metal rings to protect the nests from climbing rats and since 2001 the population has been stable or very slowly increasing and old territories are being reoccupied (6).

Animalia,Taita apalis ,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Cisticolidae,Apalis (1),10 - 12 g (3),Most of the original forest of the Taita Hills has now been lost either to cultivation or to plantations of non-native timber trees. The Taita apalis is thought to be confined to just five of the remaining tiny isolated forest fragments and these fragments are still under serious threat from agriculture plantations firewood extraction and cattle grazing which may prevent natural regeneration (2) (3) (5) (7) (8). Although now protected a lack of clear boundary demarcations can make it difficult to effectively conserve these forest fragments and wildfires are also a threat in some areas (2). This highly endangered bird was believed to number no more than 600 to 930 individuals in 2001 (2) (6) (7) and its population is fragmented into tiny isolated subpopulations (2) putting it at increased risk of extinction. Alarmingly surveys in 2009 and 2010 indicated a major crash in the remaining population with possibly only 60 to 130 birds now remaining although the causes of this dramatic decline are unclear (4). As it lives close to the maximum altitude within its range climate change is a potential threat as it could leave the Taita apalis with nowhere to move to if local conditions change (2).,Fortunately for the Taita apalis a range of conservation activities are now underway in the Taita Hills. The remaining forest fragments are being safeguarded by the Kenya Forest Department while Nature Kenya is committed to conservation in the area (2). An international research project is ongoing which includes studies into the Taita apalis (2) (9) and conservation actions include reforestation plans to reconnect forest patches and the development of alternative income-generating activities such as bee-keeping and butterfly-rearing. Local farmers have also been taught about responsible agricultural practices and tree nurseries have been established to provide native trees for restoring degraded habitat and fast-growing non-native trees to create buffer zones and to reduce pressure on the native forest (2) (6) (7).

Turdus olivaceus helleri,Taita thrush ,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Turdidae,Turdus (1),Length: 20-22 cm (2),Decades of forest clearance for cultivation and non-native timber plantations have reduced the indigenous forest of the Taita Hills to a tiny fraction of its former range. Today the surviving forest patches on which the highly specialised Taita thrush depends remain under serious threat from clearance and degradation. As a result the Taita thrush is currently listed as Critically Endangered on the IUCN Red List. One of the smaller sub-populations also has a highly male-biased sex ratio which might have significant consequences for the subpopulation\u2019s long term survival\xa0(2)\xa0(3)\xa0(6) (7).,In cooperation with local communities considerable conservation work is underway in the Taita Hills. In order to restore existing forest fragments and hopefully enhance connectivity between them efforts are being made to reforest areas with indigenous seedlings. Farmers are also being educated in environmentally responsible agricultural practices and local people are being taught alternative income generating activities such as bee-keeping and butterfly rearing. In addition an ongoing collaborative research project is in place which will provide the ecological data necessary to implement appropriate conservation measures. As part of future conservation measures a translocation project for the most threatened subpopulation of the Taita thrush is being developed\xa0(2)\xa0(3)\xa0(6).

Sport hunting poaching for food and habitat destruction have all been cited as the causes behind the tamaraw\u2019s precarious present day situation (5) as well as an outbreak of <strong>rinderpest</strong> in the Philippines in the 1930s (5).  Its head was once a valued trophy of hunters and many local people depended on it as a source of meat (4).,Despite significant efforts to protect the tamaraw numbers remain alarmingly low (6).  The tamaraw is fully protected under Philippine law (1) and the Iglit-Baco National Park (now also known as the Mangyan Heritage Park (5)) was established for its protection (2) although this area is not exempt from being impacted by the threats mentioned above.  In 1979 the Tamaraw Conservation Program was initiated with the aim of safeguarding the tamaraw and its habitat undertaking population and habitat surveys reforestation programs and educational campaigns although there is some concern over how well any of these measures have been so far been achieved (6).

Lagarto Canario Moteado,Tenerife speckled lizard ,Animalia,Chordata,Reptilia,Squamata,Lacertidae,Gallotia (1),Snout-vent length: up to 15 cm (2)Tail length: 28.3 cm (2),The Tenerife speckled lizard has an extremely restricted range with just 40 isolated populations occurring along a 9 kilometre stretch of the west coast of Tenerife and one further population in the south. The population of this species is thought to total no more than 600 individuals and is at risk from the effects of inbreeding (1).,The most important conservation measure for the Tenerife speckled lizard is the control of <strong>feral</strong> cat populations. Measures so far have included the use of fencing to exclude <strong>feral</strong> cats from the known habitat of the Tenerife speckled lizard (1). Future control measures of <strong>feral</strong> cat populations need to take into account the potential for inadvertently casing rat numbers to increase through the removal of their main predator (6).

Measures to protect the remaining wild population have also been recommended together with a ban on all trade in wild specimens and strict regulation of traffic with aquarium stocks (4) (5).

The total population may number only around 200 to 250 individuals and is fragmented into small subpopulations which are unable to interbreed (1) (6) (7) (8) (11). As with many of Vietnam\u2019s primates (8) hunting is the most immediate threat to this species (1) (2) (6) (14). Although described as bad-tasting and not the main target of hunting trips the Tonkin snub-nosed monkey is still commonly shot when encountered and is either consumed or used in traditional medicine (1) (8) (11) (14). Groups often do not flee from hunters making the species particularly vulnerable to being shot (1) (8) (12).,International trade in the Tonkin snub-nosed monkey is prohibited under its listing on Appendix I of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) (5). The Tonkin snub-nosed monkey is also protected by law in Vietnam making it illegal to kill capture or trade in the species and is listed as Critically Endangered on the Red Data Book of Vietnam (11). The Tonkin snub-nosed monkey occurs in at least two protected areas Na Hang and Cham Chu Nature Reserves and may also occur in others although populations in these areas are still under threat and continuing to decline despite conservation efforts (1) (6) (8) (11). A population occurring in Khau Ca an isolated forest within the buffer zone of the Du Gia Nature Reserve will likely benefit from the creation of a Species and Habitat Conservation Area (1) (6) (11) (15) whilst a range of conservation activities have been put in place by Fauna &amp; Flora International for a newly discovered population in Quan Ba District near the border with China (7) (15).

Pava de Trinidad, Pava Rajadora, Yacutinga Cariazul,Trinidad piping guan ,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Galliformes,Cracidae,Pipile (1),Length: 69 cm (2),The Trinidad piping guan has undergone a drastic decline in population numbers mainly due to illegal hunting but also from the effects of deforestation either for timber or for the conversion to plantation agriculture (2). These factors continue to threaten this species today (1).,The Trinidad piping guan has been legally protected since 1963 and international trade in the species is banned by its listing on Appendix I of CITES (2). Much of the present range is within forest reserves but the laws protecting both the species and the habitat are generally poorly enforced (2). Recent campaigns appear to be finally changing attitudes and species-specific ecotourism may have a role to play in the future of this species (2). Presently however the population is extremely small (estimated at around 200 individuals) (2) and time to save this species may be running out.

Diomedea exulans dabbenena,Tristan albatross ,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Procellariiformes,Diomedeidae,Diomedea (1),Length: 110 cm (2)Wingspan: up to 3.5 m (2),The Tristan albatross is in grave danger of becoming extinct in the foreseeable future with numbers having decreased by 28 percent over 46 years on Gough Island disappeared almost entirely on Inaccessible Island and already become extinct on Tristan da Cunha. The dramatic decline in numbers on Inaccessible Island is attributed to predation by feral pigs (now absent) and humans while the extinction on Tristan was probably the result of human exploitation in addition to predation by rats. On Gough storms have caused peat slips that have buried and killed nesting adults although this is likely to be only a very rare occurrence (3). The main threat comes from <strong>bycatch</strong> from longline fisheries with satellite tracking indicating a substantial overlap between the range of these birds and areas where longline fisheries are well known for their high rates of seabird bycatch mortality (3) (9). Furthermore if one parent is lost at sea the other cannot cope with the food demands of their chick and the chick will most probably die. Astonishing recent research has also shown that invasive introduced house mice three times the size of those in Europe are also devastating seabird populations on Gough Island by preying upon chicks (3) (10). The chicks are up to 250 times the weight of the mice but are largely immobile and defenceless the species having evolved over millions of years on an island with no natural predators (10). Approximately 1000 Tristan albatross chicks are thought to be killed each year by these seemingly unlikely predators (10). In fact a recent survey has shown that in 2008 the number of Tristan albatross chicks that have gone on to fledge is five times lower than it should be.,The Tristan albatross is listed on Annex 1 of the Agreement on the Conservation of Albatrosses and Petrels (ACAP) which seeks to coordinate activity to mitigate known threats to albatrosses. Gough and Inaccessible Island are nature reserves and together form a World Heritage Site. Both islands are uninhabited apart from a meteorological station on Gough. Satellite tracking monitors the dispersal of these birds which helps provide information on the potential impact of longline fisheries. Educating fisheries about mitigation measures to reduce <strong>bycatch</strong> mortality is an ongoing conservation priority for all albatross species (3).

The area of Mexico where this species lives has been significantly affected by deforestation leaving only very small areas of the original dense tropical forest for the native species. This deforestation is the result of agricultural development in the area (1).\xa0\xa0,Although there are no official conservation strategies known to be in place for the Tumbala climbing rat (9) this species is legally protected by the Mexican government (1).

Plantae,Turbinicarpus ,Plantae,Tracheophyta,Magnoliopsida,Caryophyllales,Cactaceae,Turbinicarpus (1),Diameter: up to 9 cm (2),Illegal collection is the main threat to <em>Turbinicarpus alonsoi</em> (1). At the time of its discovery it was one of the most sought-after cacti. Artificial propagation in high numbers made it quickly available to collectors although wild plants and possibly seeds were still exported illegally from Mexico. Nowadays plants seedlings and seeds of cultivated origin are quite common but wild populations have suffered significantly from illegal collection with the plants having drastically diminished in number at the more accessible sites near the road (5). The wild population is currently estimated at around 5000 individuals restricted to just one tiny area and its numbers have more than halved since the species\u2019 discovery (1).,<em>Turbinicarpus alonsoi </em>is listed on Appendix I of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) which includes species threatened with extinction which are or may be affected by trade. Trade in this species should be subject to particularly strict regulation in order not to further endanger its survival and must only be authorized in exceptional circumstances (3).

Much of the terrain within its range is too steep for cultivation but nevertheless the main threat to this shrike remains the extensive loss of forest habitat due to clearance for cultivation and cutting for timber and firewood. Most of this destruction has occurred at lower elevations in the <strong>submontane forest</strong> the preferred habitat of this species\xa0(2)\xa0(3)\xa0(4)\xa0(5) (8). A further threat introduced to the area more recently is banana farming with bananas planted beneath the forest canopy as a cash crop\xa0(3)\xa0(4) (9). Unfortunately this involves clearing shrubs and thinning the trees as well as gradually felling further trees to provide additional nutrients for the banana plants. Eventually this process destroys the forest with the land then usually converted to subsistence maize farming\xa0(9).,Uluguru North and Uluguru South Forest Reserves are managed as important water catchment areas for the 3.5 million people of the city of Dar-es-Salaam and are also of high importance in terms of biodiversity\xa0(2)\xa0(5)\xa0(8)\xa0(9). There are plans underway to reconnect the two reserves and to upgrade them to the status of Nature Reserve\xa0(2)\xa0(5)\xa0(7) and a range of conservation projects are underway in the area including work with local communities habitat restoration further surveys of the Uluguru bush-shrike population and monitoring of the species\u2019 preferred habitat\xa0(2)\xa0(7)\xa0(8)\xa0(9). The development of ecotourism may also provide an alternative source of income for local people and an incentive to protect the forest\xa0(8)\xa0(9). Further conservation measures recommended for this rare <strong>endemic</strong> bird include additional monitoring and population estimates increased efforts to reduce firewood and timber harvesting within the reserves reforestation at lower elevations raising awareness of the importance of the area and continuing to work closely with local communities to ensure the appropriate management and sustainable utilisation of forest resources\xa0(2)\xa0(5)\xa0(8).

Swamper,Utila spiny-tailed iguana ,Animalia,Chordata,Reptilia,Squamata,Iguanidae,Ctenosaura (1),Ctenosaura (1),The tiny distribution of the Utila spiny-tailed iguana makes it incredibly vulnerable to any threats. Currently those threats come in the form of habitat degradation and hunting. As tourism on the island of Utila increases the mangrove forest habitat of the spiny-tailed iguana is being cleared for the construction of houses and marinas and used as a garbage dump site (1). Beaches are also being affected with some beaches being sold for the development of houses hotels and road construction and other beach areas becoming covered with introduced invasive plants creating a habitat unsuitable for egg-laying (1). In addition despite being protected by Honduran law this rare reptile is still hunted locally for its meat (1).,Tremendous conservation efforts have been initiated for the Utila spiny-tailed iguana in an attempt to prevent its extinction. In 1994 the Frankfurt Zoological Society and the Senckenberg Nature Research Society together initiated work to preserve the Utila spiny-tailed iguana. As well as conserving the iguana and its mangrove habitat the project aimed to promote the sustainable development of the island and create environmental awareness among the local inhabitants (3).

Animalia,Valencia toothcarp ,Animalia,Chordata,Actinopterygii,Cyprinodontiformes,Cyprinodontidae,Valencia (1),Female length: 71 mm (2)Male length: 67 mm (2),The population of the Valencia toothcarp has undergone a decline of more than 80 percent in the past 10 years which is mainly attributable to the introduction of a non-native species but also as a result of habitat loss and degradation (1) (7). In the early 20th century the eastern mosquitofish <i>Gambusia holbrooki</i> was introduced to the <strong>Iberian Peninsula</strong> in order to control malaria. The fish were not only successful in preying upon the mosquito larvae found in the wetland water bodies but were also more efficient at foraging than the native Valencia toothcarp. The invasive fish were therefore able to out-compete the Valencia toothcarp for resources during periods of scarcity and have promoted the native species\u2019 decline (7). This has been compounded by the increasing habitat loss and degradation predominantly fuelled by the fact that the Valencia toothcarp\u2019s range is a popular tourist destination. Many areas of this species\u2019 wetland habitat have been drained to make way for development and to reduce mosquito breeding grounds (3) while the remainder are affected by urban and agricultural pollution (1). At present the Valencia toothcarp is perilously close to extinction with just ten wild populations of which only five have favourable conservation status (2),The Valencia toothcarp is listed in the Annexes II and IV of the European Union Habitats Directive and in the Appendix II of the Bern Convention both of which require that efforts are made to protect this species and its habitat (1). In order to fulfil this requirement three European action programmes have been developed to create a reserve network within this the Valencia toothcarp\u2019s range. In addition since 1993 extensive reintroductions have been carried out restocking regions from which this species was previously extirpated. Nevertheless further protection is still required for the remaining wild populations along with the continuation of reintroductions and implementation of educational programmes to raise awareness of this threatened species\u2019 plight (2).

Animalia,Vancouver Island marmot ,Animalia,Chordata,Mammalia,Rodentia,Sciuridae,Marmota (1),3.0 - 6.5 kg (4),Natural <strong>successional processes</strong> are probably responsible for the original scarcity of the Vancouver Island marmot through tree encroachment in the alpine meadows it inhabits. The main causes of the recent severe decline are thought to be the disruption of the habitat due to logging activities weather fluctuations and increases in deer numbers which can cause an influx of predators. (4).,The Vancouver Island marmot gained legal protection under the British Columbia Wildlife Act in 1980 and a recovery team was set up in 1988 to devise a Recovery Plan (2). A captive breeding programme is now underway with the help of Toronto Zoo (3) and reintroductions are planned.

cochito, Gulf of California harbour porpoise, Gulf of California porpoise, Gulf porpoise,Vaquita ,Animalia,Chordata,Mammalia,Cetartiodactyla,Phocoenidae,Phocoena (1),Average male length: 134.9 cm (2)Average female length: 140.6 cm (2),It was estimated in 2007 that only around 150 vaquita remained in the world (4); a number that is declining rapidly as the species is impacted by significant threats (7). The upper Gulf of California is not only home to this Critically Endangered species it is also the site of intensive commercial and artisanal fishing (7). Vaquitas become entangled in the gill nets and trawl nets that are used in these activities claiming the lives of an estimated 39 to 84 vaquitas each year (2). This is considered the principal threat to the vaquita\u2019s survival (7).,Time is quickly running out for the vaquita with a group of scientists in 2007 stating that they believed there were only two years remaining in which to find a solution to saving this species (4). Some measures have already been implemented; the Mexican government created the Upper Gulf of California and Colorado River Delta Biosphere Reserve in 1993 to protect the vaquita and other endangered species (2). In 2005 the Government also created a vaquita reserve the area of which partially overlaps with the Biosphere Reserve (10). A ban on gillnet fishing is currently being enforced within the vaquita reserve but gillnetting and shrimp trawling continues in the Biosphere Reserve and elsewhere within the range of vaquita (10) (11). Whilst these are incredibly important steps in the battle to save the vaquita if conservation efforts are not increased substantially the vaquita will become extinct (7).

brown spider monkey,Variegated spider monkey ,Animalia,Chordata,Mammalia,Primates,Atelidae,Ateles (1),Male head-and-body length: 47 – 50 cm (2)Female head-and-body length: 45 – 48 cm (2)Male tail length: 76 – 81 cm (2)Female tail length: 74 – 76 cm (2)Male weight: c. 10 kg (2)Female weight: c. 7.3 kg (2),Both <strong>subspecies</strong> of variegated spider monkey are considered to be at enormous risk in Colombia (1) having suffered widely from hunting for food (2) and habitat destruction due to human encroachment and conversion to agricultural land (4). Sadly the species\u2019 large size deems it an easy target for hunters while its slow reproductive rate and generally low population densities makes it especially vulnerable to population collapses as a result of over-hunting (4). The habitat of the hybrid spider monkey (<i>A. h. hybridus</i>) is patchily distributed and there is a concern that few populations remain that are of an adequate size to be viable in the mid to long term. Populations are failing to be actively managed even within protected areas. However the brown spider monkey (<i>A. h. brunneus</i>) does not occur in any protected area and its population size is thought to be much smaller than that of the nominate subspecies (1). The brown spider monkey (<i>A. h. brunneus</i>) has a small geographic range where forest loss degradation and fragmentation are unfortunately widespread. Thus this subspecies has been officially recognised in 2004 and 2006 as one of the world\u2019s 25 most endangered primates (4).,The hybrid spider monkey (<i>A. h. hybridus</i>) is known to occur in 4 protected areas: Catatumbo-Bar\xed El Cocuy National Park and Tam\xe1 National Park in Colombia and Guatopo National Park in Venezuela (2). Although not in any protected areas a refuge remains for the brown spider monkey (<i>A. h. brunneus</i>) in the Serran\xeda de San Lucas in southern Bol\xedvar which has been identified as an important site for the potential establishment of a national park. A park in the Serran\xeda San Lucas would protect a number of species <strong>endemic</strong> to the region including two other threatened primate species the white-footed tamarin (<i>Saguinus leucopus</i>) and woolly monkey (<i>Lagothrix lagothricha lugens</i>). However the region has been a centre of civil unrest for years and census work there would be hazardous since guerilla groups have placed anti-personnel mines in some parts of the mountain range. Although limiting opportunities for surveys and conservation work this civil unrest has proved to be a double-edged sword since it is also probably the reason why forest is still remaining considering the insatiable destruction of the forests elsewhere across the country (4).

Animalia,Visayan warty pig ,Animalia,Chordata,Mammalia,Cetartiodactyla,Suidae,Sus (1),Females: 25 - 30 kg (5)Males: 35 - 40 kg (5)Male head-body length: 115 - 125 cm (5)Female head-body length: 90 - 100 cm (5),The Visayan warty pig is highly endangered; the species has been lost from 3 of the 6 major islands where it was found and is on the verge of disappearing from a fourth (4). Deforestation in the Philippines has been widespread and habitat loss along with hunting pressure is one of the main causes of the precipitous decline in numbers. Interbreeding with domestic pigs provides a further threat to the few surviving populations and it seems unlikely that purebred forms will persist in the wild for long (4). These pigs also suffer from persecution by local farmers who view the animals as pests; they are subject to high levels of illegal hunting pressure for local consumption are caught in pitfall traps or wire snares and may sometimes be killed with explosive devices that are baited and buried in the ground to be excavated by rooting individuals (6).,The Visayan Warty Pig Conservation Programme was established in 1991 (4) with the long-term aim of reintroducing 'warties' into areas from which they have been lost (3). Two captive breeding and rescue centres have been established on Negros one by Silliman University and another at the Negros Forests and Ecological Foundation (4). In addition a centre has been established on the island of Panay by the College of Agriculture and Forestry; as of June 2001 the total captive population for the species was 41 (4). The Visayan Warty Pig Conservation Programme is also involved with research into these poorly understood pigs and works to increase local awareness of the issues involved. The Philippines has more species of wild pig than any other nation however most of these are severely endangered and habitat loss and hunting are rife; the efforts to save the Visayan warty pig are a battle against time (3).

dulungan, Rufous-headed hornbill, writhed-billed hornbill,Visayan wrinkled hornbill ,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Coraciiformes,Bucerotidae,Aceros (1),Length: 60 - 65 cm (2),Habitat loss in the form of deforestation has been the major cause of a precipitous decline in the Visayan wrinkled hornbill and has resulted in its local extinction from the island of Guimaras (4). Shifting agriculture has cleared vast areas of forest and development and plantations have also played a part in habitat loss (7). In 1988 it was estimated that only four percent of Negros and eight percent of Panay remained forested (4). These birds have also been hunted for food and for collection for the pet trade in parts of their range and the isolated fragments of populations that remain are extremely vulnerable to any chance events such as the local failure of fruiting trees (4).,In 2001 the Visayan wrinkled hornbill was on the brink of extinction with only 60 to 80 breeding pairs remaining in the wild (8) (9). Fortunately effective conservation measures initiated by the Philippine Endemic Species Conservation Project (PESCP) saw the number of occupied nest holes on Panay increase to 1108 in 2008 (9). This was achieved primarily through a highly successful nest guarding scheme involving local communities (8) (9). Although it is not known how many Visayan wrinkled hornbills remain on Negros if any at all the success of the conservation measures on Panay offer considerable hope for the future of this species (8).

Animalia,Water frog ,Animalia,Chordata,Amphibia,Anura,Leptodactylidae,Telmatobius (1),Length: 5 cm (2),<em>Telmatobius espadai </em>is now an extremely rare species; a population census undertaken in 1998 found just one tadpole. This tadpole showed symptoms of chytridiomycosis a disease that causes death in frogs and is thought to contribute to declines and even extinctions in frog species around the world (1) (6). There are also significant concerns over the possible effects of a road situated very near to one of the locations where the frog has been located (1). In addition various species of water frog are sometimes consumed as part of drink with supposed aphrodisiac qualities and this may also have contributed to the decline of this species (7).,Despite <em>Telmatobius espadai </em>being classified as Critically Endangered by the IUCN Red List there are presently no known conservation methods in place for this species and no current information on its status. The Rio Apaza population is located on the edges of the Carrasco National Park and if it persists it will hopefully benefit from this proximity (1) (3).

Diomedea irrorata,Waved albatross ,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Procellariiformes,Diomedeidae,Phoebastria (1),3 – 4 kg (3),Like other albatross species the greatest threat to the waved albatross is human fishing activities. Many are unintentionally drowned by longline fishing boats; a fishing method that involves a single line up to 130 kilometres long with thousands of baited hooks attached to it being pulled behind a boat. Waved albatrosses scavenging in the ocean try to eat the bait from the line as it is set behind the boat but instead swallow the hooks and are dragged under and drowned (7). Currently waved albatross are only affected by longlining when feeding off the coast of Peru as industrial longline fishing is prohibited in the Galapagos Marine Reserve. However there is pressure from the fishing industry to allow longlining within the reserve which would have an extremely damaging impact on the population of waved albatross (8).,Espa\xf1ola is part of the Gal\xe1pagos National Park and Marine Reserve and World Heritage Site which means that this breeding site of the waved albatross is well protected. There are no introduced species on the island and tourism is well regulated. The other potential breeding site the Isla de la Plata is part of Machalilla National Park but does not have the same level of protection as Espa\xf1ola and therefore the albatross could benefit from increased protection of this island (5).

Animalia,Wellington’s solitary coral ,Animalia,Cnidaria,Anthozoa,Scleractinia,Dendrophylliidae,Rhizopsammia (1),,Before 1982 Wellington\u2019s solitary coral was considered to be abundant at some sites.  Then the <strong>El Ni\xf1o</strong> event of 1982 and 1983 struck which destroyed most colonies of this species except for colonies at Cousins and Gordons Rocks.  Yet since 2000 Wellington\u2019s solitary coral has not been found even around these two small islets despite targeted searches.  The dramatic loss of this species since the <strong>El Ni\xf1o</strong> event suggests that this coral is particularly sensitive to changes to the temperature of the water in which they live and hints at their vulnerability to the effects of global climate change (1).,The unique biodiversity of the Gal\xe1pagos Islands and the surrounding waters is recognised and valued and thus the region is protected by being designated a Marine Reserve and World Heritage Site (1).  Wellington\u2019s solitary coral is also included in Appendix II of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) meaning that any international trade in this species should be carefully regulated (2).  Unfortunately neither of these measures protects this Critically Endangered coral from the threats of natural or man-induced climate change.

From 1992 to 2007 it is thought that around one third of the total population found in protected areas was killed by this lethal virus (1). Increasingly the trade in bushmeat is posing more of a threat to the survival of the species and cleared forests are ever more accessible to hunters. The demand for meat has increased from both road labourers and a growing urban market (7). Western gorillas are very susceptible to the illegal bushmeat trade as gorilla meat is viewed as a symbol of wealth and prestige (8). Male gorillas will actively defend their females and offspring if their group encounters a threat and this increases their chances of being killed by a hunter (8).,The western gorilla is listed on Appendix I of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) (3) and there has been a decline in international trade of the species (4). The United Nations Environmental Program (UNEP) has recognised the urgent need to protect our closest relatives and has established a Great Ape Survival Project (GRASP) aimed at identifying the conservation initiatives required to secure the future of the apes and at obtaining political support and funding to allow these to be achieved (9).

Western short-necked turtle,Western swamp turtle ,Animalia,Chordata,Reptilia,Testudines,Chelidae,Pseudemydura (1),Male weight: up to 0.55 kg (2)Female weight: up to 0.41 kg (2)Male carapace length: up to 155 mm (2)Female carapace length: up to 135 mm (2),This turtle has always had a restricted distribution; the species depends on marginal habitat and has low reproductive potential (4). Today however the western swamp turtle is Critically Endangered and the population at Twin Swamps became extinct in 1985 (4). The swamps of this turtles' habitat have been drained and filled in for agricultural purposes greatly reducing the available range (6). In addition the population at Twin Swamps in particular suffered from predation by the introduced red fox (<i>Vulpes vulpes</i>); <strong>aestivating</strong> individuals protected only by leaf litter are especially vulnerable (6).,The two remaining swamps containing this species were made into nature reserves in 1962 and a captive breeding programme at Perth Zoo has been running since 1988 (6). The captive population has been used to re-establish a viable population of western swamp turtles within the Twin Swamps Reserve (4). A fox-proof fence has been constructed around remaining swamps to provide further protection (4). The Western Swamp Turtle Recovery Plan has been running since 1992 it aims to at least double the population of this rare turtle in 10 years and to establish a captive population of at least 50 individuals (4).

Indian copal tree, Piney varnish tree, White dhamar,White damor ,Plantae,Tracheophyta,Magnoliopsida,Theales,Dipterocarpaceae,Vateria (1),Average height: 40 m (2),<i>Vateria indica</i> has been severely affected by overexploitation and habitat loss and today few healthy populations remain (1). In addition to the large-scale timber-harvesting operations that began in the 19th century the Western Ghats have also been impacted by clearance for agriculture and plantations. The forests are now mostly restricted to steep areas that are difficult to access (8).,Some populations of <i>Vateria indica</i> are found in forest reserves and small-scale replantation efforts are being made in some degraded rainforests and barren areas (1) (6). Although the status of this species is critical it apparently shows good regeneration where conditions permit hence adequate protection of areas from clearance and degradation could allow it to make a recovery (1).

Plantae,White lauan ,Plantae,Tracheophyta,Magnoliopsida,Theales,Dipterocarpaceae,Shorea (1),Height: up to 50 m (2)Trunk diameter: up to 182 cm (2),Numbers of white lauan have become depleted due to logging and <strong>slash-and-burn</strong> agriculture (2) (4).  The valuable timber of the white lauan is used for general construction and for furniture making (2).,The white lauan most likely occurs in a number of protected areas throughout the Philippines such as the Sierra Madre.  However despite this so-called protection illegal logging activities can continue to pose a threat (5).

In the Philippines large areas of forest had already been cleared by the end of the nineteenth century for agricultural expansion which continued throughout the twentieth century (7). However the most extensive and rapid deforestation in the latter half of the century has been caused by commercial logging with has particularly impacted the valuable primary lowland dipterocarp forests which shrunk from an estimated 10 million hectares in the 1950s to only one million by the late 1980s (7). Forest clearance and habitat degradation throughout Borneo and the Philippines may also be having a detrimental effect on the tree\u2019s natural pollinators reducing the rate at which the species can reproduce and recover its populations (4).,This threatened species is located in a proposed reserve site (1) which if awarded official reserve status in the future would confer some degree of protection to the species. The Philippines\u2019 Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR) has also established a <strong>genebank</strong> of economically useful <strong>endemic</strong> and endangered forest tree species including white seraya (8). This project has involved collecting and propagating the species to be maintained in an arboretum and gathering data on growth and survival of the species planted (8). A large scale project has also been initiated in Sabah Malaysia to rehabilitate 25000 hectares of logged forests using indigenous tree species such as dipterocarps in order to counteract atmospheric carbon dioxide (9). <i>Parashorea malaanonan</i> has been one of the main dipterocarp species planted to date (9). Indeed although such conservation efforts are not directed specifically at white seraya the tree is likely to benefit indirectly from a variety of such efforts to conserve lowland forests generally. Whether for environmental concerns or to protect the host of endangered species that inhabit lowland forests across Borneo and the Philippines conservation of such forests will undoubtedly help preserve this enormous tree which needs to be recognised for its crucial ecological importance as much as for its economic value.

Animalia,White-bellied cinclodes ,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Furnariidae,Cinclodes (1),99 – 109 g (2),The habitat of the white-bellied cinclodes has been relatively undisturbed by humans due to its high altitude. However in the past five years the use of peat by humans has increased for use in activities such as mushroom-growing and gardening and this peat is extracted from the bogs which are inhabited by the white-bellied cinclodes. Due to the cinclodes\u2019 apparently very specific habitat requirements the activities of humans in towns and cities could reduce the survival chances of this species high-up in the mountains (2) (3).,The white-bellied cinclodes occurs within Jun\xedn National Reserve and has been the focus of a few recent studies attempting to estimate the species\u2019 population (2). This is an important step towards determining its status and therefore enabling appropriate conservation measures to be taken such as designating important reserves and monitoring the effects of peat extraction on the population (3).

imperial heron,White-bellied heron ,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Ciconiiformes,Ardeidae,Ardea (1),Length: 127 cm (2),For over a century the white-bellied heron has been at risk due to deforestation because its preferred habitat is mature forest (3). It is also under threat from the fragmentation and degradation of its wetland habitats through pollution over-exploitation of resources and the rapid growth of aquatic vegetation due to leaching of artificial fertilisers (2). In addition the white-bellied heron is vulnerable to disturbance and habitat degradation as a result of agricultural expansion human settlements and poaching (2) as well as overfishing (3).,The white-bellied heron population is extremely small at fewer than 250 mature individuals and is rapidly declining putting this species at severe risk of extinction (2).

Forbes’s kite,White-collared kite ,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Falconiformes,Accipitridae,Leptodon (1),550 - 580 g (2),With a total population so far estimated at perhaps fewer than 100 mature individuals and a highly restricted and fragmented range (3) (10) the white-collared kite may be the most endangered bird of prey in South America (6) and indeed is one of the rarest birds in the world (5). The <strong>Atlantic coastal forest</strong> of Brazil is highly threatened by habitat loss mainly in the form of clearance for sugarcane and coffee plantations and pressure from urbanisation (7) (8) (13). Within this species\u2019 range massive deforestation has drastically reduced forest cover to less than one percent of its former extent and the small remaining forest fragments are under continued threat from logging as well as from fires (3) (10). In addition a lack of knowledge about the white-collared kite whose very existence as a distinct species was still debated as recently as 2005 hinders efforts to conserve it (5) (6) (8).\xa0,The white-collared kite is listed on Appendix II of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) meaning that any international trade in the species should be carefully monitored (4). In addition a large area of Murici Alagoas is legally protected and organisations such as the Instituto para a Preserva\xe7\xe3o da Mata Atl\xe2ntica (IPMA) are working to create forest reserves on privately-owned land (3) (10). Further surveys and research into the white-collared kite are urgent priorities (3) (6) (10) and studies have been recommended to clarify its <strong>taxonomic</strong> status using genetic analysis (3). The designation of Murici as a biological reserve and the protection of other forest areas (3) (10) (13) such as Mata do Coimbra Ibateguara Alagoas (12) will also be important to its continued survival. Birds of prey make ideal charismatic \u2018flagship\u2019 species for conservation (6) and so any efforts to conserve this highly endangered kite would also be likely to benefit many of the other threatened species that share its fragile habitat.

Trachypithecus francoisi poliocephalus,White-headed langur ,Animalia,Chordata,Mammalia,Primates,Cercopithecidae,Trachypithecus (1),Male head-and-body length: 55 â 62 cm (2)Female head-and-body length: 47 â 55 cm (2)Male tail length: 82 â 89 cm (2)Female tail length: 77 â 82 cm (2)Male weight: 8 â 9.5 kg (2)Female weight: 6.7 â 8 kg (2),Granted the dubious honour of being one of the International Primatological Society\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x98World\xe2\x80\x99s Top 25 Most Endangered Primates\xe2\x80\x99 the white-headed langur is in the company of such conservation priorities as the Sumatran orangutan (<i>Pongo abelii</i>) and the eastern gorilla (<i>Gorilla beringei</i>) (6). The focus of conservation efforts must fall primarily on the Cat Ba Island <strong>subspecies</strong> with possibly as few as 59 individuals remaining today. This shockingly low number is the result of a massive 98% decline over the course of 40 years from between 2500 and 2800 individuals in the 1960s to just 53 in 2000. Such a dangerously small population of Cat Ba langurs gives the impression that the Chinese <strong>subspecies</strong> <i>Trachypithecus poliocephalus leucocephalus</i> is thriving with between 600 and 800 individuals alive today. This is of course far from the truth particularly as declines were recorded in the populations at Longgang National Nature Reserve and the Fusui Rare and Precious Animal Reserve in 1998 (5).,With just 53 Cat Ba langurs in the wild and two in captivity at the Endangered Primate Rescue Centre of Cuc Phuong National Park the Cat Ba Langur Conservation Project was started in 2000 by M\xc5\xb1nster Zoo and the Zoological Society for the Conservation of Species and Populations (ZGAP). Given the cause of the langur\xe2\x80\x99s decline the main aim of the project was to halt poaching with the additional intention of promoting conservation awareness amongst the inhabitants of Cat Ba Island. The project has been extremely successful in dramatically reducing deaths as a result of poaching bringing the number from 30 deaths in the eight months prior to its start to three deaths in the first four years of the project. In this time nine langurs were born and have survived. The langurs are closely monitored and protection measures are in place particularly in the newly created langur sanctuary within the National Park. This highly protected area is home to 20 individuals from a large reproducing group which are protected by a rotation of 20 rangers \xe2\x80\x93 an incredible ratio of one ranger to one langur. The sanctuary is visibly marked around its circumference and is inaccessible to tourists. The Cat Ba Langur Conservation Project has constructed two new ranger stations provided boats to ease patrols and has even seen the voluntary relocation of several local floating households to support the rangers (3). The Cat Ba langur also has the support of Flora and Fauna International\xe2\x80\x99s Flagship Species Fund (5) and the Cat Hai District Women\xe2\x80\x99s Union who implemented a project entitled \xe2\x80\x98Contributing to Biodiversity Conservation in Cat Ba National Park through Community Activity\xe2\x80\x99 (7).

Davison’s ibis,White-shouldered ibis ,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Ciconiiformes,Threskiornithidae,Pseudibis (1),Size: 75 – 85 cm (2),The white-shouldered ibis has been left with an extremely small fragmented vulnerable population of fewer than an estimated 250 mature individuals after having suffered dramatic declines as a result of deforestation drainage of wetlands hunting and disturbance. Much of the species\u2019 historical decline is due to habitat loss through logging of lowland forest and drainage of wetlands for agriculture (most of the Mekong floodplain in southern Laos has been converted to rice-paddy) livestock-grazing grass-harvesting and development. Habitat destruction has been compounded by hunting for food and human disturbance which now pose the greatest threats to the species (2).,The white-shouldered ibis is legally protected in Indonesia Myanmar and East Malaysia (4) and occurs in several protected areas including Cat Tien National Park Vietnam where it probably breeds Ang Trapeang Thmor Cambodia and Xe Pian National Biodiversity Conservation Area (NBCA) and Dong Khanthung proposed NBCA Laos (2). BirdLife International's Cambodia Programme Office is working with relevant government departments to promote Western Siem Pang as a protected area a site that supports the only known potentially viable population (up to 70 individuals) of white-shouldered ibis in mainland Southeast Asia and which contains three other Critically Endangered birds. In partnership with local communities ongoing public awareness campaigns are being conducted in Laos and Cambodia to educate people about the status of these bird populations discourage persecution and establish activities to prevent further population declines (5). The governments of Laos and Vietnam are also having notable success in controlling gun ownership which is apparently benefiting populations of large waterbirds in some areas and may be helping the white-shouldered ibis (4).

Pava Aliblanca,White-winged guan ,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Galliformes,Cracidae,Penelope (1),Length: 85 cm (2),The initial decline in the white-winged guan was believed to result from overhunting which continues to be a threat today and which may also explain the species\u2019 disappearance from coastal areas. In addition the white-winged guan is under pressure from habitat destruction and fragmentation with forests being cleared for agriculture timber charcoal firewood and artisanal woodcrafts (2) (4) (5) (9) (10). Indeed over 90 percent of the original forest cover of the region may have already been removed (11) and the guan\u2019s decline was exacerbated after land reforms in 1968 allowed greater public access to privately owned land (4) (5). After its rediscovery in 1977 the white-winged guan was believed to number only a few hundred birds at most and is estimated at around 150 to 250 individuals today (2) (4) (5) (7) with around 75 birds held in captivity in 2007 (2). In addition to its small size and restricted range the population is also severely fragmented with only a small number of individuals known from most sites (2) (4).,The white-winged guan has been the subject of a range of conservation efforts since its rediscovery. International trade in the species is banned under its listing on Appendix I of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) (3) and the white-winged guan and its habitat are legally protected within the Laquipampa Wildlife Refuge an area established specifically to protect this species (2) (7) (10). In 1980 a captive breeding programme was set up (4) (12) (13) (14) (15) and the first captive-bred birds were reintroduced to Chaparri Private Conservation Area a community owned and managed reserve in 2001 (2) (9) (14) (16). Training programmes were provided for park guards (2) (10) (13) and the programme has also involved environmental education and outreach in local communities (2) (7) (12) (14) (17). The released birds have started breeding successfully in the wild with over 50 wild-born chicks already added to the population (2) (15) (16) (17).

Mongolian wild camel,Wild Bactrian camel ,Animalia,Chordata,Mammalia,Cetartiodactyla,Camelidae,Camelus (1),600 – 1000 kg (2),Wild Bactrian camels have been heavily hunted for their meat and hide over the centuries (4) and today only a few highly fragmented populations persist (1). These camels continue to be persecuted mainly as they are seen as competition with domestic livestock for the precious water and grazing of the desert (1). Bactrian camels persisted in China even though the Gashun Gobi desert (Lop Nur) was used as a nuclear test site for 45 years (3) today further habitat loss has occurred with the development of a gas pipe-line in the north of the reserve (1) and highly toxic illegal mining (3). Competition with domestic camels and livestock as well as <strong>hybridisation</strong> with domestic camels poses a further threat to the survival of the unique Bactrian camel (1). The total population is predicted to undergo an 80% reduction over the next three generations prompting the species to be listed as Critically Endangered by the World Conservation Union (IUCN) (1).,Areas of the Gobi and Gashun Gobi desert (Lop Nur) where the Bactrian camel remain are protected by the Great Gobi Reserve in Mongolia which was established in 1982 and by the newly established national reserve \u2018Lop Nur Wild Camel Reserve\u2019 in China (1) (7). Both governments have agreed to protect this trans-boundary migrating species in a historic move (3). A captive breeding programme based in Mongolia and run by the Wild Camel Protection Foundation began in 2003 in an effort to safeguard the future of this fascinating animal (3). Recent studies of dromedary (one-humped) camels (<em>Camelus dromedarius</em>) have revealed an extraordinary immune system; camel milk has been found to arrest diabetes in humans and has proved to be a substitute for insulin with these results prompting hopes that further studies of the wild Bactrian camel may yield similarly remarkable discoveries (3) (7).

Plantae,Wollemi pine ,Plantae,Tracheophyta,Coniferopsida,Coniferales,Araucariaceae,Wollemia (1),Height: 35 m (2),The remaining population of Wollemi pines may represent a relict of the previous extent of this species; it is thought that these trees may have been undergoing a slow natural decline for thousands of years (3). The species is today threatened by the small size and limited range of its population which is intrinsically at risk from any chance event that may occur such as fire or the spread of disease (3).,The Wollemi pine is protected in Australia and the population is located within the Wollemi Pine National Park. A Recovery Plan has been drawn up outlining strategies for the management of this fragile population; the overall objective is to ensure that this species remains viable in the long-term (3). Such a fascinating tree may have much to reveal about ancient species that were previously known only from fossils. Its discovery underlines the vital role that habitat conservation has to play in the preservation of biodiversity (3).

Plagoptere Argente,Woundfin ,Animalia,Chordata,Actinopterygii,Cypriniformes,Cyprinidae,Plagopterus (1),Length: up to 10 cm (2),From being the most abundant species in the Virgin River the woundfin has suffered a dramatic population decline (2). Loss and fragmentation of its habitat due to human activities is thought to be a major contributing factor in this decline (1) (4). The damming of the rivers and use of the water for agriculture and mining have also led to changes in the flow regimes of the rivers in the woundfin\u2019s range (2) (4).,A major priority for the conservation of the woundfin is the protection and monitoring of its remaining habitat (4). Research is also being carried out in order to refine captive breeding methods so that this species can be re-introduced back into its historic range. However previous attempts to reintroduce the woundfin have proved unsuccessful (4).

Plantae,Wright's gardenia ,Plantae,Tracheophyta,Magnoliopsida,Rubiales,Rubiaceae,Rothmannia (1),Height: up to 6 m (2),Wright's gardenia is restricted to one single population on Aride Island in the Seychelles. Other nearby populations have become extinct for unknown reasons which could also affect the only remaining population. Although the reason for local extinction is unknown it is thought that introduced pests may have been the cause as well as competition with <em>Pisonia grandis</em>. The highly restricted range of Wright\u2019s gardenia makes it particularly vulnerable to extinction (1).,The island of Aride is a Special Reserve (1) and has been the focus of a long-running habitat restoration programme carried out by the Royal Society for Nature Conservation which involves the removal of introduced plants such as coconut palms (3). Almost all non-native trees have been removed and <strong>endemics</strong> such as Wright's gardenia have been planted and are showing encouraging sings of recovery (3). Stands of Wright's gardenia have also been planted on the islands of Fregate and Silhouette; the first wild germination on an island other than Aride for over 100 years has recently occurred on Fregate (3). Careful monitoring and management of these populations are required but the future of this beautiful tree now appears more secure thanks to concerted conservation efforts in the Seychelles.

Dabry’s sturgeon,Yangtze sturgeon ,Animalia,Chordata,Actinopterygii,Acipenseriformes,Acipenseridae,Acipenser (1),16 kg (2),The Yangtze sturgeon is at risk from over-fishing pollution and habitat degradation and loss. An important factor in its decline was the construction of the Gezhouba Dam across the Yangtze River at Yichang in Hubei Province in 1981. As this prevented upstream migration necessary for spawning the Yangtze sturgeon is now only found above the dam (2).,Conservation of this fish is now urgent with emphasis needed on habitat protection capture control and stock replenishment. This sturgeon species spawns earlier in life than most sturgeons and therefore has aquaculture potential for caviar production. Controlled production of the Yangtze sturgeon could both reduce fishing levels and allow <strong>reintroductions</strong> of fish back into the river (2).

Not only is the very limited range of this monkey being reduced due to deforestation but the yellow-breasted capuchin is trapped for the pet trade and hunted for meat (6).,Some protection of this species is achieved as a result of its presence in the Una Biological Reserve the Condur\xfa State Park (2) and at two biological research stations. A survey of this species is being conducted believed to be among the rarest of Neotropical primates (2) but numbers will continue to decline unless the habitat of the yellow-breasted capuchin is protected (6).

Lesser sulphur-crested cockatoo,Yellow-crested cockatoo ,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Psittaciformes,Psittacidae,Cacatua (1),350 g (2),The main factor responsible for the precipitous decline of all of the races of the yellow-crested cockatoo has been unsustainable over-exploitation for the pet trade. Habitat loss has also played a part in the decline (4).,The yellow-crested cockatoo is now fully protected by Indonesian law and international trade is restricted by CITES. It occurs within a number of protected areas and a species Recovery Plan was initiated in 1998. This programme continues today and is making progress in five key areas namely: controlling trade conserving key habitats removing the market demand for wild birds by establishing captive breeding facilities research into ecology and population dynamics and awareness campaigns (4).
