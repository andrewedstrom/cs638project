Birds are strongly attached to nest sites and clearings are more exposed to wind turbulence which has a detrimental effect on breeding success and causes higher adult mortality (6). Recent development proposals for the island have again raised concern over the viability of remaining breeding habitat (5).,The majority of Abbott's booby nest sites occur within the Christmas Island National Park which was established in 1980 and covers 63 percent of the island (6). Nest site locations are monitored and the regeneration of previously cleared forest has occurred on much of the island (5). Although mining was resumed in 1990 it only involved the reworking of previously mined areas (6). The continued preservation and ban on clearing of the unique Christmas Island rainforest will be the key to the future viability of the Abbott's booby population (5). , , ,0,01,Abbotí¢ŒóŒ»s duiker,Cephalophus spadix,Abbottí¢ŒóŒ»s duiker (Cephalophus spadix),Animalia,Chordata,Mammalia,Cetartiodactyla,Bovidae,Cephalophus (1),50 í¢ŒóŒñ 60 kg (2),Like many other duikers Abbott\xe2\x80\x99s duiker is being impacted by a combination of hunting and habitat destruction (1) (2) (5).\xa0Hunted for its meat Abbott\xe2\x80\x99s duiker falls prey to snares laid in the forests it inhabits even within so-called protected areas (1) (7) while suitable habitat is gradually encroached upon by agriculture and logging (1) (2) (5).\xa0These human activities have resulted in the extinction of Abbott\xe2\x80\x99s duiker in areas where it once occurred and in 2008 the total population of Abbott\xe2\x80\x99s duiker was estimated at fewer than 1500 individuals (1).,Although Abbott\xe2\x80\x99s duiker occurs within several protected areas such as the Kilimanjaro National Park Udzungwa Mountains National Park and New Dabaga/Ulangambi Forest Reserve this does not completely protect this duiker from the threats of habitat loss and illegal hunting (1) (2) (5).\xa0In the Southern Highlands of Tanzania there are current efforts to employ hunters in environmental education initiatives in exchange for the cessation of hunting.\xa0The Abbott\xe2\x80\x99s duiker is also being used as a flagship species in village education programmes.\xa0This will hopefully be beneficial for many forest-dwelling animals including the Abbott\xe2\x80\x99s duiker (1).\xa0The expansion of certain protected areas to incorporate other important forests inhabited by Abbott\xe2\x80\x99s duiker (1) in addition to the enforcement of hunting bans within those areas (7) may be essential if this Endangered duiker is to survive. ,hunting; ,protected; ,1,12,Adelaide pigmy blue-tongue skink; pygmy bluetongue,Tiliqua adelaidensis,Adelaide pygmy bluetongue skink (Tiliqua adelaidensis),Animalia,Chordata,Reptilia,Squamata,Scincidae,Tiliqua (1),Male snout-vent length: 3.8 - 10.6 cm (2)Female snout-vent length: 8.8 - 10.7 cm (2)Tail length: 2.2 - 7.9 cm (2),The Adelaide pygmy bluetongue skink was once feared to be the first of Australia\xe2\x80\x99s approximately 700 reptiles to become extinct since European colonization. Thankfully it was rediscovered in 1992 after 33 years of being presumed extinct (3). Currently only ten small populations of the Adelaide pygmy bluetongue skinkare known to exist (6). Arguably Australia\xe2\x80\x99s most enigmatic reptile its scarcity can be attributed to its unique ecology as well as population declines due to extensive habitat destruction (2)(3).,The South Australia Department of Environment and Conservation has produced a National Recovery Plan for the Adelaide pygmy bluetongue skink with the overall objective to achieve down-listing of the species from Endangered to Vulnerable within 10 years. The plan details actions such as ensuring remaining habitat is protected from any further degradation and undertaking field studies to establish the skink\xe2\x80\x99s habitat requirements (6). At present all populations of the Adelaide pygmy bluetongue skink occur on private land making the establishment of agreements with landowners an essential part of any plan and incentives may be offered to landowners to become involved in establishing sanctuaries for the Adelaide pygmy bluetongue skink on their land (6). , ,protected; ,0,13,Adriatic trout; softmouth trout,Salmo obtusirostris,Adriatic salmon (Salmo obtusirostris),Animalia,Chordata,Actinopterygii,Salmoniformes,Salmonidae,Salmo (1),80 - 425 g (4),The Adriatic salmon faces a number of threats including overfishing for sport and for food as well as habitat destruction and competition with introduced species (1).,There are currently no known conservation measures in place for the Adriatic salmon (1) (5). It has been recommended that a number of key rivers in which this species occurs should be given full protection and guarded from any habitat alteration (5). ,fishing;overfishing;invasive;pet; , ,4,04,black-footed penguin; jackass penguin,Spheniscus demersus,African penguin (Spheniscus demersus),Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Sphenisciformes,Spheniscidae,Spheniscus (1),Length: 60 - 70 cm (2),The population of the African penguin has declined and it is estimated that its current size is a mere 10 percent of what it was at the turn of the 20th Century. Originally the fall in numbers was the result of the over-collection of eggs for food and disturbance caused by the collection of <strong>guano</strong> for fertiliser. Today however depleted fish stocks due to over-fishing and the risk of oil pollution are the most pertinent threats to the survival of the African penguin (5); a recent oil spill affected around 40 percent of the population.\xa0 Predation by Cape fur seals (<em>Arctocephalus pusillus</em>) and competition with them for food and breeding sites as well as shark predation has also had severe effects on African penguin numbers (2). The ongoing and rapid decline of the African penguin led to the species being uplisted from Vulnerable to Endangered on the IUCN Red List in 2010 (2).,The African penguin is protected by its listing on Appendix II of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) (3) and on Appendix II of the Convention on Migratory Species (CMS) (4). All of the breeding areas of the African penguin in South Africa are protected as National Parks or Nature Reserves and the collection of <strong>guano</strong> or eggs is no longer permitted. The recovery of rescued oiled African penguins has also been shown to be successful. Populations need further monitoring and the possibility of conserving fish stocks is under investigation amongst other measures if the future of Africa\xe2\x80\x99s only penguin is to be secured (2). ,fishing;pet;pollution; ,cites;protected; ,3,25,Afrormosia; Assamela; Kokrodua,Pericopsis elata,African teak (Pericopsis elata),Plantae,Tracheophyta,Magnoliopsida,Fabales,Leguminosae,Pericopsis (1),Maximum height: 50 m (2)Diameter: up to 2m (2),The trade in the timber from this tree has soared since 1948 and the degree of exploitation has long been unsustainable across its range. The habitat has been lost and now regeneration is insufficient to replace lost populations (1). Illegal logging continues to decimate the remaining populations (2).,Urgent regulation of logging is necessary including the employment of Forestry Stewardship Council regulations on harvesting. In Ghana some enrichment planting is being practised where suitable areas with low numbers of African teak are planted with African teak seedlings but conservation of current populations is a priority (2). , , ,0,06,Cape hunting dog; painted hunting dog,Lycaon pictus,African wild dog (Lycaon pictus),Animalia,Chordata,Mammalia,Carnivora,Canidae,Lycaon (1),18 - 34 kg (2),African wild dogs require large home ranges to support viable populations and recent habitat fragmentation has caused a population decline (4). African wild dogs traditionally have a reputation for attacking livestock and despite this rarely occurring in practice they are therefore often persecuted wherever they come into contact with humans (2) (4). In addition road accidents and incidental snaring have recently become an important cause of mortality (2). These wild dogs are susceptible to disease; particularly those carried by domestic dogs such as canine distemper and rabies. A final threat that keeps African wild dog populations low is competition and predation with the other large carnivores of the African savanna such as lions and spotted hyaenas (6).,The current population of African wild dogs is estimated to be less than 5500 individuals (2). The majority of dogs are found in medium sized populations which are extremely vulnerable to sudden environmental change. Due to their expansive home ranges large areas of contiguous habitat are the key to the survival of this species and it is estimated that protected areas need to be greater than 10000 square kilometres in order to prevent detrimental contact with local human settlements (2) (4). Consequently even most of the larger reserves cannot fully contain African wild dog packs leading to clashes with humans (2). Preventing persecution through education is also a priority of the conservation action plan (2) (4) in an effort to preserve this most intriguing and unique <strong>canid</strong>. ,fragmentation;disease;pet; ,protected; ,3,17,Hemignathus wilsoni,Hemignathus munroi,Akiapola'au (Hemignathus munroi),Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Drepanididae,Hemignathus (1),Length: 14 cm (2),As with many species on Hawaii the \xe2\x80\x98Akiapola\xe2\x80\x99au is threatened by deforestation and habitat degradation due to livestock grazing and is also preyed upon by introduced rats and feral cats. The introduction of mosquitoes to Hawaii has resulted in the spread of avian diseases which confine many bird species including the \xe2\x80\x98Akiapola\xe2\x80\x99au to higher elevations. This species has a low reproductive rate and is slow to recover from population reductions (2).,Relatively large \xe2\x80\x98Akiapola\xe2\x80\x99au populations are found within the boundaries of Ka\xe2\x80\x99u Forest Reserve and Hakalau Forest National Wildlife Refuge. Outside these areas some habitat is being restored (2) and young koa forests on the volcano of Mauna Loa now support high densities of Akiapolaau (6). It is hoped that the \xe2\x80\x98Akiapola\xe2\x80\x99au might be <strong>re-introduced</strong> into other newly restored habitat. Plans to restore corridors of habitat between areas of forest occupied by the \xe2\x80\x98Akiapola\xe2\x80\x99au may reduce the damaging effects of habitat fragmentation including <strong>inbreeding depression</strong> (2). ,disease; , ,1,08,Albanian frog; Albanian pool frog; Balkan frog; Virpazar frog,Pelophylax shqipericus,Albanian water frog (Pelophylax shqipericus),Animalia,Chordata,Amphibia,Anura,Ranidae,Pelophylax (1),Male length: c. 71 mm (2)Female length: c. 74 mm (2),The main threats to the Albanian water frog are the drainage of wetlands and agrochemical and industrial pollution of aquatic habitats. Over-collection of this species for commercial purposes is a significant threat in the northern parts of its range such as along the shores of Lake Skadar (1) (3) (4).,The Albanian water frog is listed on Appendix III of the Bern Convention which means that it should be afforded protection (12). ,pet;pollution; ,protected; ,2,19,Albanian frog; Albanian pool frog; Balkan frog; Virpazar frog,Pelophylax shqipericus,Albanian water frog (Pelophylax shqipericus),Animalia,Chordata,Amphibia,Anura,Ranidae,Pelophylax (1),Male length: c. 71 mm (2)Female length: c. 74 mm (2),The main threats to the Albanian water frog are the drainage of wetlands and agrochemical and industrial pollution of aquatic habitats.

Alternatively it may simply be a misperception resulting from lack of observations (2). Pelts of this species have been seen in local markets occasionally killed by herders who carry guns (2). The high Andean Indians appear to have little knowledge of this species and the only pelts observed to be used in local ceremonies have been those of the pampas cat (5). There are no records of international trade of this species either. It is therefore thought that hunting of the Andean cat is primarily carried out to protect local cattle (1). The common threat of habitat destruction common worldwide does not apply here as there have been no significant changes in land-use of the high Andes over the last 2000 years. If anything the human population has decreased in these regions (2).,International trade of this species is prohibited by its listing on Appendix I of CITES (3) and according to national legislation the Andean cat is fully protected throughout its range (2). There is a huge gap in our knowledge of this species and how to best protect it. However since the publication of the Cat Action Treasury Plan there have been substantial increases in research efforts (1) (7). The Cat Action Treasury has sponsored surveys to determine the status of this species and improve our understanding of this cat in order to inform conservation measures (8). These surveys confirmed the rarity of this species. The Andean cat has been upgraded from Vulnerable to Endangered on the IUCN Red List (1) (7). It has been suggested by the Andean Cat Alliance (AGA) previously the Committee for the Conservation of the Andean Cat (COCGA) that because this cat needs large areas to live successfully and its range extends over the Andes through international borders a multinational cooperative approach is necessary for its long-term conservation (5). AGA has launched a multinational project to collate and analyse data on the on the Andean cat in order to initiate immediate conservation efforts and in 2004 a conservation action plan was drawn up for the species. The fact that there are no captive specimens or breeding programmes for the Andean cat means that the survival of this species depends on the development and success of these conservation measures (5). ,hunting; ,cites;protected; ,1,211,Mantidactylus microtympanum,Boehmantis microtympanum,Angelí¢ŒóŒ»s Madagascar frog (Boehmantis microtympanum),Animalia,Chordata,Amphibia,Anura,Mantellidae,Boehmantis (1),Male length: 5.3 cm (2)Female length: 7.6 cm (2),Owing to its restricted range Angel\xe2\x80\x99s Madagascar frog is highly vulnerable to the ongoing large-scale degradation and destruction of forest that is occurring in south-east Madagascar. Although this species remains relatively abundant at some localities a multitude of threats including expanding human settlements agriculture logging livestock grazing charcoal manufacture and the spread of invasive eucalyptus are causing its population to decline. The pressures have already proven severe enough to cause local extinctions around Fort Dauphin near the southern limit of the Angel\xe2\x80\x99s Madagascar frog\xe2\x80\x99s range (1).,While there are no known conservation measures specifically targeting Angel\xe2\x80\x99s Madagascar frog it is found in two protected areas the Andohahela and Midongy-du-Sud National Parks (1). Nevertheless increased protection of this species\xe2\x80\x99 habitat along with educational programs to inform local people of how best to manage the forests sustainably are vital measures that must be implemented if Angel\xe2\x80\x99s Madagascar frog is to be conserved (6). ,invasive; ,protected; ,1,112,Blind swamp eel,Ophisternon infernale,Anguila ciega (Ophisternon infernale),Animalia,Chordata,Actinopterygii,Synbranchiformes,Synbranchidae,Ophisternon (1),Length: up to at least 32.5 cm (2),The main threats to this species are various forms of water pollution caused by humans. In rural areas sewage is rarely treated before being discarded and industrial and domestic waste is sometimes disposed of in caves. Another threat comes from over-harvesting of freshwater which may lead to <strong>saline waters</strong> creeping into the normally freshwater zone. The human population of the Yucatan peninsula is growing so a greater and greater strain on water resources can be expected in the future. Another potential threat is the modification and/or the intensive use of this fish\xe2\x80\x99s habitat by humans for recreational or tourism purposes (2).,There are currently no conservation measures targeting the Anguila ciega. ,pollution; , ,1,013,armoured chameleon; stump tailed chameleon,Brookesia perarmata,Antsingy leaf chameleon (Brookesia perarmata),Animalia,Chordata,Reptilia,Squamata,Chamaeleonidae,Brookesia (1),Length: up to 11cm (2),Chameleons are favoured as pets across the world due to their fascinating appearance and behaviour. Collection and trade has therefore taken its toll on many chameleon species but international trade in this species is now prohibited (9). However habitat degradation remains a threat even though the species is found within a national park. As this species depends on the presence of leaf litter for food shelter and laying its eggs and also on low shrubs and seedlings for roosting at night its survival is dependent on maintaining the existing vegetation structure within the Tsingy forests (5) (10).,The Antsingy leaf chameleon is listed on Appendix I of the Convention on International Trade of Endangered Species (CITES) and as such international trade of this species is illegal (3). Its survival is not immediately threatened in the wild although it is still justifiably a conservation priority because of its limited range and the continued degradation of its favoured habitats within the national park (1) (2) (10). ,pet; ,cites; ,1,114,Apolinarí¢ŒóŒ»s marsh-wren,Cistothorus apolinari,Apolinarí¢ŒóŒ»s wren (Cistothorus apolinari),Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Troglodytidae,Cistothorus (1),Length: 12 cm (2),Apolinar\xe2\x80\x99s wren has a small population and this combined with its limited geographical range results in an inherent threat of extinction. Numbers of Apolinar\xe2\x80\x99s wren have indeed declined significantly in the last 50 to 70 years primarily due to a 95 percent loss in habitat (3). A significant cause of this habitat destruction is the burning of wetlands for agriculture mainly onion cultivation and cattle-farming. With agriculture also frequently comes the use of insecticides and other chemicals resulting in a reduction in this bird\xe2\x80\x99s insect prey and posing a toxic threat to the bird. In areas around the capital Bogot\xc3\xa1 remaining wetland habitats are at risk from human settlement and highway development and reed-harvesting and tourism also pose minor threats (1).,Apolinar\xe2\x80\x99s wren occurs in El Cocuy National Park Boyac\xc3\xa1 and in Sumap\xc3\xa1z National Park Cundinamarca which may offer protection against the threat of habitat loss (2). ,loss; ,captive breeding; ,1,115,Hemitragus jayakari,Arabitragus jayakari,Arabian tahr (Arabitragus jayakari),Animalia,Chordata,Mammalia,Cetartiodactyla,Bovidae,Arabitragus (1),c. 23 kg (2),The Arabian tahr is currently extremely endangered as a result of intense grazing competition from livestock illegal hunting and habitat degradation through human development (5). Unfortunately the species\xe2\x80\x99 dependence upon visiting waterholes leaves it vulnerable to ambush by poachers (3). Human migrations to urban areas have increased in Oman in recent years resulting in domestic goats being left to become feral which now forage in areas that were once the realm of the tahr. Additionally several roads and buildings have been constructed near and within the tahr\xe2\x80\x99s range which are new potential sources of disturbance pollution and habitat fragmentation. In particular plans for mineral extraction in southern parts of the range could result in significant habitat loss (6). Tahr populations in UAE appear to be especially localised and possibly isolated. The concern is that isolation of sub-populations will lead to the diminished genetic variation associated with inbreeding which in turn results in increased susceptibility to disease and decreased fertility spelling disaster for the Arabian tahr in UAE (3).,In 1973 efforts were initiated to protect the Arabian tahr and in 1975 active protection was granted over a wide range of the eastern Hajar Mountains of Oman with local men recruited as rangers under the Office of the Advisor for Conservation of the Environment (6). Unfortunately this area still awaits to be awarded official status by a Royal Decree with an approved funded and implemented management plan (6) (7). However in 2009 Wadi Wurayah Fujairah home to the Arbaian tahr and other rare and endangered species was officially declared as the United Arab Emirates\xe2\x80\x99 first protected mountain area (8). ,loss;fragmentation;hunting;disease;pet;pollution; ,captive breeding;protected; ,6,216,Lagartija Aranesa,Iberolacerta aranica,Aran rock lizard (Iberolacerta aranica),Animalia,Chordata,Reptilia,Squamata,Lacertidae,Iberolacerta (1),Snout-vent length: up to 6 cm (2),The rocky alpine habitat of the Aran rock lizard is currently threatened by overgrazing by cattle and may face further pressure in the future from the development of ski resorts and the associated building of roads and tracks (1). The IUCN who assessed the conservation status of this lizard also state the possible development of hydroelectric projects and mining as a future threat to this species (1). The low reproductive potential of the Aran rock lizard and its restricted distribution only act to enhance the devastating effects that such threats may have on the population (3).,The Aran rock lizard is listed on Appendix III of the Bern Convention a convention which aims to conserve wild flora and fauna and their natural habitats and to promote European co-operation in that field (4). Wild animal species on Appendix III are protected but can be exploited if regulated in accordance with the convention (4). It is yet to be seen whether this level of protection is sufficient to ensure the survival of this Endangered reptile. , ,protected; ,0,117,Obregnita,Obregonia denegrii,Artichoke cactus (Obregonia denegrii),Plantae,Tracheophyta,Magnoliopsida,Caryophyllales,Cactaceae,Obregonia (1),Head diameter: 2.5 - 20 cm (2),Artichoke cacti are in high demand for commercial trade and have previously been collected in large numbers (2). Local people use this species to treat rheumatism and over-collection for this reason is also a threat (1). Habitat destruction through urban development road construction and livestock grazing pose further threats to survival; accelerated erosion has been observed at both known sites of this species (2). The total population is thought to have decreased by as much as 50% over the past 50 years; although around 5000 individuals still remain (1).,International trade in wild-taken plants and seeds of the artichoke cactus is banned by its listing on Appendix I of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) (3). The species is also protected under Mexican law (4) although illegal collection does still occur (1). It has been suggested that the Valley of Jaumave is a prime candidate for a nature reserve (2) which if created would preserve the future of this appealing cactus amongst various others. , ,cites;protected; ,0,218,Japanese crested Ibis; Toki,Nipponia nippon,Asian crested ibis (Nipponia nippon),Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Ciconiiformes,Threskiornithidae,Nipponia (1),Length: 55 - 78.5 cm (2),Although abundant throughout Eastern Asia up until a century ago deforestation and habitat destruction caused the Asian crested ibis population to crash during the 20th century. When the last wild birds in Japan were taken into captivity in 1981 the species was believed to be extinct in the wild but later that year a tiny population of seven birds was discovered in a remote mountainous area of Shaanxi Province in China (4) (5) (9). Thanks to the implementation of a conservation programme and the enforcement of laws protecting habitat the wild population had risen to more than 600 wild individuals by 2009 (4) (5). However although its population continues to increase there are still fears for the Asian crested ibis with various factors still threatening to undermine this species\xe2\x80\x99 recovery. Indeed the ongoing conversion of rice fields to dry wheat production is rapidly reducing the availability of feeding areas. Additional threats include the use of agrochemicals at feeding sites occasional hunting and low genetic diversity (4) (9).,In addition to its legal protection in China numerous conservation measures have been introduced since the Asian crested ibis\xe2\x80\x99 rediscovery including the protection of nesting sites and the periodic prohibition of logging hunting with firearms and usage of agrochemicals (4) (9). As of 2009 there are around 500 birds occurring within several captive breeding programmes (5). Following the successes of these programmes captive bred birds are now being used to reintroduce the Asian crested ibis to parts of its original range in China and Japan (4) (5) (10). ,hunting; ,captive breeding; ,1,119,Indian elephant,Elephas maximus,Asian elephant (Elephas maximus),Animalia,Chordata,Mammalia,Proboscidea,Elephantidae,Elephas (1),Head-body length: 5.5 - 6.4 m (2)Shoulder height: 2.5 - 3 m (2)Male weight: 5.4 tonnes (2)Female weight: 2.7 tonnes (2),Numbers of Asian elephants were decimated by habitat loss and hunting throughout their historical range. Vast tracts of land have been logged or simply cleared to accommodate the growing human population in the region (2). Such disturbance from infrastructure development can also cause increased stress and confusion amongst elephants (8). Elephant populations have become increasingly isolated in the fragmented habitat that remains often coming into conflict with local farmers (7). Crops are damaged and lives lost; up to 300 people a year are killed by elephants in India (4) leading to retaliation on local elephants (9). Poaching for ivory is also a threat and because only males have tusks populations can become extremely skewed towards females thus affecting breeding rates (2).,The Asian elephant is protected from international trade by its listing on Appendix I of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) although illegal poaching remains a problem (4). Many elephants occur within protected reserves but these are often too small to accommodate them leading to human-elephant conflict (4). Many elephant populations are also found along international borders where management may be weak and a lack of trans-boundary cooperation also hinders elephant protection and management (8). The creation of wildlife corridors to extend reserve lands together with the cessation of poaching are just some of the conservation steps needed to secure the future of the Asian elephant (9). The World Wildlife Fund (WWF) launched the Asian Rhino and Elephant Action Strategy (AREAS) in 1998 to address these issues and this multifaceted conservation programme is also working with local people to reduce conflict with these magnificent animals (8). ,loss;hunting;poaching; ,cites;protected;wwf; ,3,320,Indian tapir; Malay tapir; Malayan tapir,Tapirus indicus,Asian tapir (Tapirus indicus),Animalia,Chordata,Mammalia,Perissodactyla,Tapiridae,Tapirus (1),250 í¢ŒóŒñ 540 kg (2),Widely abundant in Southern Myanmar Thailand Malaysia and Indonesia in the early 1930s Asian tapir populations have since rapidly declined and now survive only as isolated populations in remote or protected areas. Habitat destruction poses the predominant threat as a result of land being cleared for human settlement and agriculture and rivers being dammed and land flooded for hydroelectric development (11). In Sumatra uncontrolled illegal logging still occurs. The tapir population is strongest in Malaysia where deforestation has greatly declined (1).,Protective game laws exist in Thailand Myanmar Malaysia and Indonesia with varying success (11). In Malaysia the Asian tapir has been given total protection since 1955 under the Wild Animals and Birds Ordinance and law enforcement has generally been effective. The use of steel wire snares has been banned here with stiff penalties if caught. However ongoing monitoring of the illegal tapir trade across the range of this species is crucial (2). Asian tapirs can be found in a number of protected areas including the Huai Kha Khaeng Wildlife Sanctuary and the Khao Sok National Park in Thailand 12 protected areas in the Western Forest Complex along the Thai-Myanmar border (1) and the Way Kambas National Park in Sumatra which contains around 200 individuals (11). However much of the suitable habitat that remains in Sumatra does not lie within protected areas and a large proportion of the tapir population occurs outside of reserves. Conservation efforts should not therefore be restricted to national parks but should endeavour to involve the cooperation of local people across the species\xe2\x80\x99 range (11). ,hunting; ,protected; ,1,121,Asian brown tortoise; Asian giant tortoise; black giant tortoise; Burmese brown tortoise; Burmese mountain tortoise; six-legged tortoise,Manouria emys,Asian tortoise (Manouria emys),Animalia,Chordata,Reptilia,Testudines,Testudinidae,Manouria (1),M. e. emys carapace length: up to 50 cm (2)M. e. emys weight: up to 20 kg (2)M. e. phayrei carapace length: up to 60 cm (2)M. e. phayrei weight: up to 37 kg (2),Like other Asian turtles and tortoises this species is severely threatened by over-harvesting and exploitation for the food and pet trade compounded by habitat destruction.

Although imports are now totally banned in the European Community this has only served to shift the trade towards Japan and the U.S. (6). The Asian brown tortoise (<i>M. e. emys</i>) is legally protected in Sabah Malaysia under the Wildlife Conservation Enactment 1997 and a license is required from the director of the Wildlife Department to hunt or collect wild specimens (6). ,pet; ,cites;protected; ,1,223,yellow pond turtle,Mauremys mutica,Asian yellow pond turtle (Mauremys mutica),Animalia,Chordata,Reptilia,Testudines,Geoemydidae,Mauremys (1),Carapace length: up to 20 cm (2),The majority of Asia\xe2\x80\x99s freshwater turtles are threatened with extinction (7) (8) and the Asian yellow pond turtle is no exception (1). This \xe2\x80\x98Asian Turtle Crisis\xe2\x80\x99 is mainly attributable to largely uncontrolled trade for food traditional medicine and pets (7) (9) (10) driven primarily by increased demand in China (7) (11).,The Asian turtle trade was largely unregulated prior to 2002. However since then several species of Asian turtle have been listed under the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) (9). The Asian yellow pond turtle is listed on CITES Appendix II which requires export permits for international trade (3). Unfortunately enforcement appears limited and globally threatened species of turtle remain in trade in China (9). ,pet;pollution; ,cites;captive breeding; ,2,224,Asian wild ass; khulan; khur; kulan; onager,Equus hemionus,Asiatic wild ass (Equus hemionus),Animalia,Chordata,Mammalia,Perissodactyla,Equidae,Equus (1),200 - 260 kg (2),The greatest threat facing the Asiatic wild ass is poaching for meat and hides and in some areas for use in traditional medicine (5) (7). The extreme isolation of many of the subpopulations is in itself a threat as genetic problems can result from inbreeding (7). Overgrazing by livestock reduces food availability and herders also reduce the availability of water at springs. The cutting down of nutritious shrubs and bushes exacerbates the problem. Furthermore a series of drought years could have devastating effects on this beleaguered species (6). Habitat fragmentation is a particular concern in Mongolia as result of the increasingly dense network of roads railway lines and fences required to support mining activities (1) (5).,The Asiatic wild ass does occur in a number of protected sites where targeted conservation action has been taken. Domestic animals have been removed from some protected areas and artificial watering holes have been made. Hay is provided for the species and there are hefty fines for poaching. Moreover the species is legally protected in many of the countries in which it occurs (6). The priority for future conservation measures is: to ensure the protection of this species in particularly vulnerable parts of its range; to encourage the involvement of local people in the conservation of the Asiatic wild ass; and to conduct further research into the behaviour ecology and taxonomy of the species (1). Fortunately several Asiatic wild ass research programmes considering these issues are already underway (5) (6). ,fragmentation;poaching; ,protected; ,2,125,Northern bluefin tuna,Thunnus thynnus,Atlantic bluefin tuna (Thunnus thynnus),Animalia,Chordata,Actinopterygii,Perciformes,Scombridae,Thunnus (1),Maximum length: 4.6 m (2)Maximum weight: 684 kg (2),With its large size and high quality flesh the Atlantic bluefin tuna has long been a favourite of fishermen and a highly valued delicacy in Japan (3).

Despite catch quotas being in place limits are often not respected and catches are frequently under-reported (5). Unless adequate management measures are quickly implemented and most importantly enforced the collapse of some Atlantic bluefin tuna stocks is a real possibility (5). It is thought that the Critically Endangered western Atlantic stock may have already collapsed the result of overfishing and poor management. This stock is now in grave danger of extinction (6).,In 1966 the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (ICCAT) was formed taking responsibility for the conservation of tunas in the Atlantic Ocean and its adjacent seas (5).

Such a limited range places the bird at risk from chance events such as natural disasters or the introduction of mammalian predators (2) (6). On Gough predation by the introduced house mouse (<i>Mus musculus</i>) is having a severe effect on the Atlantic petrel\xe2\x80\x99s breeding success with just two percent of the chicks reaching fledging in 2007 (2). The large population of native southern skua (<i>Catharacta antarctica</i>) are also known to feed on seabirds including the Atlantic petrel (2).,Gough Island is both a Nature Reserve and World Heritage Site and while this provides good protection from human disturbance it does not offer the Gough bunting any protection from the mouse predation that is driving it towards extinction (2). A study of the mice conducted by The Royal Society for the Protection of Birds (RSPB) and funded by the UK government's Overseas Territories Environment Programme has shown that their eradication from the island is feasible. Unfortunately however until adequate funding is acquired this will not occur (7). Gough Island is widely recognised as having one of the most diverse bird colonies in the world including four endangered species and every effort should therefore be made to protect it and the rich biodiversity it hosts (8). ,hunting;pet; , ,2,028,Lagartija Pallaresa,Iberolacerta aurelioi,Aurelioí¢ŒóŒ»s rock lizard (Iberolacerta aurelioi),Animalia,Chordata,Reptilia,Squamata,Lacertidae,Iberolacerta (1),Snout-vent length: up to 6 cm (2),The rocky alpine habitat of Aurelio\xe2\x80\x99s rock lizard is currently threatened by overgrazing by cattle and may face further pressure in the future from the development of ski resorts and the associated building of roads and tracks (1).  The IUCN who assessed the conservation status of this lizard also state the possible development of hydroelectric projects and mining as a future threat to this species (1).  The low reproductive potential of Aurelio\xe2\x80\x99s rock lizard and its restricted distribution only act to enhance the devastating effects that such threats may have on the population (3).,Aurelio\xe2\x80\x99s rock lizard is listed on Appendix III of the Bern Convention a convention which aims to conserve wild flora and fauna and their natural habitats and to promote European co-operation in that field (4).  Wild animal species on Appendix III are protected but can be exploited if regulated in accordance with the convention (4).  It is yet to be seen whether this level of protection is sufficient to ensure the survival of this Endangered reptile. , ,protected; ,0,129,Australian bittern; black-backed bittern; boomer; brown bittern; bull-bird; bullhead; bunyip bird,Botaurus poiciloptilus,Australasian bittern (Botaurus poiciloptilus),Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Ciconiiformes,Ardeidae,Botaurus (1),Length: 66 - 76 cm (2) (3)Wingspan: 105 - 118 cm (2)Male weight: 875 - 2085 g (3)Female weight: 571 - 1135 g (3),The Australasian bittern has a small and rapidly declining population mainly due to the loss and destruction of its natural habitat (7).

In particular laurel forest has been cut for grazing and agriculture and lost due to <strong>afforestation</strong> by Japanese red cedar (<i>Cryptomeria japonica</i>) (3). Food shortages are now a cause for concern throughout the year but most severe in late winter. The species has been left with an extremely small population and restricted range on just one island. The resulting reduced genetic variation may make it vulnerable to random environmental changes and inbreeding may reduce reproductive output (2). In addition predation by feral cats and rats is a potential problem although their impact is currently unknown (2) (3).,The Azores bullfinch is protected under Portuguese law and the area in which it is found in Pico da Vara has been designated a Natural Forest Reserve by the Regional Government of the Azores (2) (4).

This species' habit of flying during the daytime makes it particularly vulnerable to persecution as colonies are easy to locate (1).,Although no specific protective legislation exists in the Azores for this species the Azores noctule is currently listed under the Bern Convention and is included in Annex IV of the EU Habitats and Species Directive meaning this species is afforded some protection (1) (8) (9). ,loss; , ,1,033,Tapir De Baird,Tapirus bairdii,Baird's tapir (Tapirus bairdii),Animalia,Chordata,Mammalia,Perissodactyla,Tapiridae,Tapirus (1),240 - 400 kg (2),Baird's tapir is primarily under threat from habitat loss throughout much of its former range. The low reproductive rate of this species means that populations are particularly vulnerable to disturbance such as habitat loss and hunting (5). Vast tracts of rainforest are being cleared to make way for cattle ranching and developments; almost all of the forest in El Salvador has been lost and there is no recent information to suggest that Baird's tapir persists in this country (5).,Baird's tapir the national symbol of Belize is protected in the majority of Central American countries although hunting laws are often poorly enforced (5). Populations are unable to withstand mass logging practices but have been known to survive and even prosper in areas where selective logging occurs which could be an important factor in their conservation (5). The IUCN/SSC Tapir Specialist Group has published a Species Action Plan identifying key actions required to protect this species; including species status surveys and the protection of habitat (5).

Ghana and Liberia both have a higher percentage of their natural forests remaining but even in these countries populations of baku have experienced significant declines and the extinction of this important species is a possibility (2).  Illegal and poorly controlled logging pose the greatest threat to the baku\xe2\x80\x99s continued existence (2) but it has also been reported that the reduction of forest elephant numbers in certain areas may limit the natural regeneration of baku (2) (8).,Baku trees are protected by law in C\xc3\xb4te d'Ivoire and due to the problem of overexploitation of timbers Ghana and Liberia have imposed bans on the exporting of baku in log form (8) (9).   Despite these measures improved regulation of the timber trade is still urgently required (2).  It has been recommended that re-planting in Liberia is necessary to prevent this species\xe2\x80\x99 extinction (8) and in all areas in which it is harvested certified sustainable forest management to Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) standards are required (2).  The Global Trees Campaign was set up with the aim of saving the world\xe2\x80\x99s most threatened tree species of which baku is one of and as a result Flora and Fauna International is currently working in Liberia with local and international partners to improve the basis for the conservation and sustainable management of forests (2).

Forest fires are a major cause of habitat loss as well as forest clearance for agriculture grazing firewood and timber. Since this species seems reluctant to cross open habitats the small pockets of birds that remain in forest fragments are in imminent danger of extinction (5). As a result Bannerman\xe2\x80\x99s turaco is only thought likely to survive if the c.100 square km of forest on Mount Oku (Kilum-Ijim forest) is preserved (2).,With the support of the BirdLife International Kilum-Ijim Forest Project local communities are now actively involved in conserving montane forest (2) (5). The condition of the forest and its endemic birds are monitored as well as the overall extent of forest cover in the Bamenda Highlands. In 2000 community-based conservation activities were also extended to other forest fragments in the Bamenda Highlands (5). Alternatives to forest clearance have been offered to farmers such as bee-keeping with the honey produced fetching a good price at local markets and plentiful honey requiring a healthy forest (2). ,loss; , ,1,041,Tembadau,Bos javanicus,Banteng (Bos javanicus),Animalia,Chordata,Mammalia,Cetartiodactyla,Bovidae,Bos (1),600 - 800 kg (2),The most significant threats facing banteng are hunting and habitat degradation and loss (1). Extinction is thought imminent in Vietnam and in Cambodia and Lao PDR habitat fragmentation caused by agriculture and new settlements is seriously threatening the remaining mainland Asian populations (3). These wild cattle have been domesticated in numerous locations most notably on the island of Bali with over 1.5 million domestic banteng thought to exist (2). Interbreeding with domestic and feral cattle threatens to contaminate the gene pool by hybridization of the remaining wild banteng and disease transmission from domestic livestock is also considered a serious danger (1) (6). The number of banteng trophies reported for sale within Cambodia and the Lao PDR along the Thai/Cambodia Thai/Lao and Thai/Myanmar borders strongly suggests that the banteng population on the mainland has been and remains under considerable pressure from hunters (2) (3). Despite legal prohibitions against trade in banteng law enforcement is inadequate and poaching and illegal trade in their meat and horns remains widespread (6) (7).,The banteng is legally protected across its range and occurs in a number of protected areas (1). However the natural resources of reserves often continue to be exploited with about 12 banteng poached annually for example in Baluran National Park Java (7). Several on-going field survey programmes exist (e.g. in Indochina) and a monitoring programme is conducted in East Java. A large captive population is maintained world-wide (1) with European zoos first importing captive banteng from collections in Indonesia as early as 1867 (4). Such populations provide a buffer against total extinction offer potential for future reintroductions into the wild and can be managed to maintain the genetic diversity of the species. In addition they now have a new and exciting role that utilises the very cutting edge of technology and scientific knowledge \xe2\x80\x93 cloning!

However the extent to which this threatens the species is not clear; the remote rugged habitat of breeding colonies may have limited access for these alien species (3). In the last 50 or so years urban development on the island has led to a dramatic increase in the number and intensity of streetlights and other bright lights which confuse large numbers of fledging Barau\xe2\x80\x99s petrels on their way to the sea at night. Grounded birds are then usually killed by vehicles or predated by dogs and cats. An additional potential threat comes from the increasing pressure for tourism to remote areas which could result in human disturbance at the nesting colonies (5).,A campaign was implemented to raise public awareness of the effect of urban lighting on petrels and to rescue as many grounded birds as possible. Each year many Barau\xe2\x80\x99s petrels are now found and rescued with increasing success; in 2001 787 petrels were rescued (2) (5). There are also proposals to reduce light pollution on the island (2). Increasing tourism suggests that conservation efforts should include strict regulation of human activities near the colonies particularly hiking and mountaineering.

In Algeria forest fires and livestock grazing are additional problems and some young animals are captured as pets. In Morocco the problems of logging and overgrazing are exacerbated by drought. Moroccan forestry authorities have considered culling macaques because of their bark stripping. They were once found throughout North Africa but now only exist in small areas (9).,Seen as a symbol of Gibraltar and valued as a tourist attraction these macaques are protected to some extent (4). In Algeria this species is protected in several national parks but there are few active conservation policies elsewhere.

Moroccan forestry authorities have considered culling macaques because of their bark stripping. They were once found throughout North Africa but now only exist in small areas (9).,Seen as a symbol of Gibraltar and valued as a tourist attraction these macaques are protected to some extent (4).

There is also a directed fishery for dogfish and skates on the Georges Bank which is thought to have led to a decline in this species. The flesh of this and other skates is used as lobster bait fish meal and pet food and the meat from its \xe2\x80\x98wings\xe2\x80\x99 (the <strong>pectoral fins</strong>) is sold as seafood (1) (2) (3) (4).,Since it was reported to be near to extinction in 1998 (7) the status of the barndoor skate has been the subject of much debate and a number of petitions have been made to list the species under the US Endangered Species Act (1) (2). The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) listed the barndoor skate as a \xe2\x80\x98Species of Concern\xe2\x80\x99 (4) but it was removed from the list in early 2010 after it was decided that there was no evidence the species was in imminent danger of extinction (8). There has been a ban on possession of the species in US waters (3) (4) and most significantly no-take zones in areas such as Georges Bank appear to have led to decreased mortality (9) and an increase in the number of juveniles (1) (2) (3) suggesting that areas protected from trawling would be effective in allowing the barndoor skate population to recover (1) (2) (7).

Logging of marri first for woodchips and now for use in flooring and furniture has dramatically reduced the availability of food and nesting trees. Additionally many nest hollows have been found to be occupied by <strong>feral</strong> bees which not only limit the bird\xe2\x80\x99s nest availability but are also known to have caused the loss of chicks and killed a brooding female. Competition for nests from maned geese (<i>Chenonetta jubatta</i>) and Australian shelduck (<i>Tadorna tadornoides</i>) may also be a factor as duck numbers increase in the south-west (9) (12).,Baudin\xe2\x80\x99s black cockatoo is listed under Appendix II of CITES limiting international trade in the species (3) and it is illegal to take these birds from the wild with a penalty of up to a maximum of $10000 for such an offence (12) (13). This cockatoo is given special protection under <i>Western Australia\xe2\x80\x99s Wildlife Conservation Act 1950</i> (4) and has been protected under Australian law since 1996 (9). Forest management has now changed so that woodchipping practices ceased in 2003 (9) (10). However the bird still clings to a precarious existence and further conservation measures are desperately required to safeguard its future including: making all shooting by commercial orchard farmers illegal; developing non-lethal methods of damage control; developing and implementing a feral bee control strategy; and protecting mature marri trees relied upon so heavily as nest and food sources by this rare <strong>endemic</strong> bird (9).

The species is also vulnerable to fire and hunting (4). Areas of prime habitat occur in and around the Morro do Diabo State Park; however five percent of this area was flooded in the early 1980's following the construction of a hydroelectric plant (7). The remaining black lion tamarin populations have been isolated for some time and studies have shown that genetic diversity is extremely low as a result of inbreeding (7). <strong>Inbreeding depression</strong> which can reduce the fitness of the population in terms of survival reproductive capacity and growth is therefore a cause for concern in this species.,A long-term programme of conservation and environmental education targeting the black lion tamarin is underway (7). An important measure to combat the effects of inbreeding will be to allow movement of individuals between the isolated sub-populations. This can occur through <strong>translocations</strong> of individuals or by creating corridors between habitat patches to facilitate movement between populations (4). Corridors have already been planted and some translocations have occurred (7). There is currently a captive population of around 100 individuals which require the occasional incorporation of wild individuals to maintain genetic variation (7). ,hunting; , ,1,051,Gaviota Maorí€Œ_,Larus bulleri,Black-billed gull (Larus bulleri),Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Charadriiformes,Laridae,Larus (1),190 í¢ŒóŒñ 270 g (2),Despite a substantial decline on South Island over the past ten to twenty years the black-billed gull remains more common on South Island than North Island where it has actually expanded its range since the 1970s. It is hoped that its overall declining trend has reversed recently partly due to a change in agricultural practices that has seen more insects and worms being revealed by ploughing. The black-billed gull has developed a habit of following ploughs and aiding farmers by picking out insect pests. However the breeding habitat of the bird continues to decline in size. This reduction in habitat is the cause of the drop in gull numbers over the last 30 years as land is increasingly turned over to agriculture. Additionally breeding habitat is currently threatened by the spread of exotic lupins which clog the waterways (2) (5).,The New Zealand Government has launched the New Zealand Biodiversity Strategy to respond to its obligations under the Convention on Biological Diversity. This includes management of wetland habitats by protecting them from development as well as by planting appropriate plant species in areas recovering from disturbance in order to stabilise the soil and reduce fertiliser run-off that can encourage the growth of exotic species such as lupins at the expense of native species. The water level must be maintained and a water care code has been established to ensure that users of wetland habitats are able to act responsibly (6). , , ,0,052,black-breasted hill turtle; Chinese leaf turtle; Indo-Chinese serrated turtle; scalloped leaf turtle; Spengler's turtle; Vietnamese leaf turtle; Vietnamese wood turtle,Geoemyda spengleri,Black-breasted leaf turtle (Geoemyda spengleri),Animalia,Chordata,Reptilia,Testudines,Bataguridae,Geoemyda (1),Carapace length: up to 11.5 cm (2),Like most Asian turtle species the black-breasted leaf turtle is in grave danger of extinction due to over-collection from the wild for the food medicine and pet trade. Turtles are highly prized for food and traditional \xe2\x80\x98medicinal\xe2\x80\x99 purposes and are ubiquitous in Asian food markets (9). Importation to the U.S. for the pet trade began in the 1980s and most specimens found in pet stores today are still freshly imported from Asia (6) although there is now substantial breeding of the species in China and some of the young exported into the global pet trade may come from farms (2). Nevertheless before reaching their destination many of these turtles have had to endure poor conditions in food markets and are malnourished or develop pneumonia mouth sores or other illnesses and almost all will have parasites from which many die (6). Another important factor in this species\xe2\x80\x99 decline is forest loss and degradation from clearance for agriculture and uncontrolled wildfires (2). Thus the high mortality rate amongst wild-caught leaf turtles combined with unsustainable rates of harvesting from the wild limited use of captive breeding and farming and ongoing habitat loss has led to a serious decline in population numbers and left this enigmatic turtle clinging to a precarious existence (9).,Substantial advances are being made in management and captive breeding of this turtle particularly in central Europe and the U.S. and captive breeding meets most of the serious hobbyist demand. However it remains cheaper to import animals for a few dollars/euros than to obtain captive-bred animals so the cheap pet imports continue and continue to be bought by impulse buyers (2). This pet market combined with habitat loss and the ongoing demand for turtles in the Asian food markets mean the outlook for the black-breasted leaf turtle and most Asian turtle species remains grim (9). ,loss;pet; ,captive breeding; ,2,153,Chanwan Lasí€Œ©l; Diablotí€Œ_n,Pterodroma hasitata,Black-capped petrel (Pterodroma hasitata),Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Procellariiformes,Procellariidae,Pterodroma (1),Length: 40 cm (2)Wingspan: 96 cm (3),Up until the latter half of the 19th century the black-capped petrel was relatively common within its breeding range (3) (10). Around this time a burgeoning human population in the Caribbean islands and consequential habitat loss harvesting for food and predation by introduced mammals saw petrel numbers crash almost to the point of extinction. Indeed for several decades prior to the early 1960s the species appeared to have vanished completely. Fortunately in 1963 an estimated 2000 breeding pairs were discovered at the existing colonies in Haiti (7). It soon became evident however that these populations were under the same pressures that extirpated the breeding populations on other islands. By the turn of this century the estimated number of breeding pairs had declined to 1000 with a total population size of approximately 5000 birds (3). Despite increased awareness the population in Haiti is likely to continue to decline as a result of continued conversion of broadleaf forest to cropland and pasture at Parc La Visite. Sadly this downward population trend on the breeding grounds may be further exacerbated by proposals to develop oil and gas fields within petrel foraging grounds off the coast of the USA (2) (15).,Most of the known black-capped petrel breeding populations occur within La Visite National Park and Pic Macaya National Park in Haiti while Sierra de Baoruco National Park in the Dominican Republic also contains small populations (7) (8) (9) (10). However despite official park status the implementation of a sustainable conservation plan in Haiti\xe2\x80\x99s two national parks has no measurable conservation effect due to political instability corruption absence of political will and the abject poverty of the local population who depend critically on the forest for their day-to-day survival. Given that almost the world\xe2\x80\x99s entire black-capped petrel breeding population occurs within these two parks ensuring their protection presents the most critical challenge to conservation efforts (16). Current proposals for Haiti\xe2\x80\x99s National Parks include establishing core ecological reserves that are strictly off-limits to humans maintenance of defined park boundaries and long-term monitoring and research of avian populations (17) (18). However with Haiti\xe2\x80\x99s breeding populations still under threat the presence of alternative nesting sites may be crucial to the species\xe2\x80\x99 survival. ,loss;pet; , ,2,054,Manorina flavigula melanotis,Manorina melanotis,Black-eared miner (Manorina melanotis),Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Meliphagidae,Manorina (1),Length: 23 - 26 cm (2),The major cause of the black-eared miner decline is habitat loss and fragmentation. Much of the eucalypt mallee in its former range was cleared for agriculture in the early 20th century by European settlers (2). This habitat alteration has led to the closely related yellow-throated miner (<em>Manorina flavigula</em>) which favours disturbed and cleared habitatscolonising areas within the black-eared miner\xe2\x80\x99s range and contact between the two species has led to <strong>hybridisation</strong>. Interbreeding between the two species is currently the greatest threat to the black-eared miner and there are now thought to be very few \xe2\x80\x98pure\xe2\x80\x99 black-eared miner colonies left (2) (4).,Although currently classified as Endangered the black-eared miner has actually improved in conservations status since 1994 when it was classified as Critically Endangered.

Prairies have been modified for intensive agriculture and there is now less than two percent of the original ferret habitat left (3). The ferret's main prey prairie dogs were systematically poisoned in vast tracts of their habitat by a government eradication programme in the mid 1900s (5). Prairie dog burrows were thought to damage cropland and ferret numbers fell in direct proportion with the dramatic decline of their prey (3). The final threat to black-footed ferret numbers and perhaps the most pertinent today is disease particularly canine distemper and plague (3). Plague introduced to North America causes even greater devastation in populations of prairie dogs and ferrets than it caused in human populations of Europe and Asia (8).,The black-footed ferret was thought to be extinct in the 1970s until a last population was discovered in Meeteetse Wyoming in 1981 (5). Under initial protection measures this population increased in numbers but then became infected by canine distemper and plague which threatened to completely wipe out the species (5).

It has been suggested that a National Park should be created in northern Russia which could help to secure some of the habitat in this region (5). ,loss;fishing;overfishing; ,captive breeding;protected; ,3,265,Whio,Hymenolaimus malacorhynchos,Blue duck (Hymenolaimus malacorhynchos),Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Anseriformes,Anatidae,Hymenolaimus (1),Length: 53 cm (2)Male weight: 1000 g (3)Female weight: 800 g (3),Habitat loss has been one of the major causes of decline in this species.

A decrease in water quality was probably the most significant agent as the loss of the species from the Cahaba River coincided with an increase in nitrogen and phosphorous caused by sewage discharge. This led to higher algal biomass and decreased levels of dissolved oxygen in the water (4) (5). The blue shiner is also threatened by increased siltation as it relies on sight to detect its prey while in Georgia urbanisation and resulting pollution and water extraction threatens the species\xe2\x80\x99 habitat. In many areas the blue shiner now exists in small highly fragmented populations which are more vulnerable to habitat degradation and a loss of <strong>genetic diversity</strong> greatly increasing the species\xe2\x80\x99 extinction risk (5) (7).,The future of the blue shiner very much depends on the protection of its habitat particularly the Conasauga River. Fortunately for this rare species efforts are underway to protect this fragile environment. The Nature Conservancy is working with private landowners and government agencies to protect the Conasauga River and conserve the populations of rare and endangered fish that inhabit its waters (5) (8). The National Resources Conservation Service is also working to protect <strong>riparian</strong> habitat around the Conasauga River and to tackle threats (5) (9).

A burgeoning population and rapid development along the southeastern coastal region of Brazil has taken its toll on the natural forest habitat (2) (6).  The clearance of land for coffee plantations sugar cane cocoa eucalyptus cattle pasture and most significantly timber extraction and charcoal production has left just a tiny fraction of original forest (6).

Surviving only on the smallest offshore islets where lack of soil prevented burrowing it was forced to compete for nest sites with the larger cliff-hole-nesting white-tailed tropicbird (<em>Phaethon lepturus</em>) which caused 70 percent breeding failure every year. Rat predation on new-hatched chicks remains as an occasional threat. During the 1960s and early 1970s before DDT pesticide use was banned DDT residues caused a 50 percent decline in breeding success due to eggshell thinning and embryo mortality (7). From the late 1960s through the 1990s light pollution from a nearby NASA tracking station and U.S. Naval air station inhibited new pair formation on the breeding islets (2). Erosion damage to the nesting islets from hurricane overwash has become a major problem due to global warming and sea level rise since 1995 (7).,The rediscovery of the Bermuda petrel\xe2\x80\x99s nesting grounds in 1951 enabled concerted conservation efforts and since 1961 all of the breeding sites have been intensively managed by a conservation officer employed by the Bermuda Government Ministry of the Environment. Periodic invasions of rats are controlled by trapping and baiting with anti-coagulant poisons and nest competition with tropicbirds has been eliminated by the installation of wooden entrances which exclude the larger tropicbirds. In addition man-made concrete burrows have been provided on the level tops of the islets to accommodate the cahow population increase. Furthermore since 1962 the six hectare soil-covered Nonsuch Island has been restored and kept predator-free as a much larger future home for the expanding population (7). ,hunting;pet;pollution; , ,3,080,Calamanian deer; Calamian hog deer; Philippine deer,Axis calamianensis,Calamian deer (Axis calamianensis),Animalia,Chordata,Mammalia,Cetartiodactyla,Cervidae,Axis (1),27 í¢ŒóŒñ 110 kg (2),These beautiful deer are hunted by local people primarily for their meat although their hides are sometimes used for drum-skins and their antlers for decoration (7).

The main reason for this is the clearance of native vegetation for agriculture which has severely reduced and fragmented this species\xe2\x80\x99 habitat (4) (8). In some cases parts of south-western Western Australia have lost over 90 percent of their original vegetation with the remainder being scattered in numerous patches of varying size and quality (12).,Carnaby\xe2\x80\x99s black-cockatoo is legally protected in Australia (2) (4) and international trade in this species should be strictly controlled under its listing on Appendix II of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) (6).

The distribution of the Carpetane rock lizard is now severely fragmented and there is an ongoing decline in the extent and quality of its habitat particularly due to alpine tourism and the construction of ski resorts (5) as well as road construction all-terrain vehicle use and overgrazing by cattle (1) (4). Additionally as with all montane species there is a concern that climate change could pose a serious threat in the future (1) (4).,The Carpetane rock lizard occurs in two protected areas: the Sierra del Guadarrama Natural Park and Sierra de Gredos Natural Park (1). ,loss;pet; ,protected; ,2,189,Phoca caspica,Pusa caspica,Caspian seal (Pusa caspica),Animalia,Chordata,Mammalia,Carnivora,Phocidae,Pusa (1),up to 86 kg (2) (3),Believed to have numbered over a million at the start of the 20th Century the Caspian seal has since undergone a dramatic decline of over 90 percent due to a range of human activities (1) (8) (9) and current losses still substantially exceed recruitment of young into the population (12). The species is particularly vulnerable as the Caspian Sea is a closed system from which the seal cannot disperse (1). The main threat to the Caspian seal is intensive commercial hunting (2) (3) (5) (9) (10) which although now regulated is still likely to exceed sustainable harvest levels (1). Illegal killing and poaching also occur (8). Intensive fishing is also a problem reducing fish stocks and resulting in seals being caught as <strong>bycatch</strong> injured by boats or deliberately killed by fishermen (1) (2) (8) (9) (10). Fish stocks are also under further threat from the voracious comb jellyfish <i>Mnemiopsis leidyi</i> which invaded the Caspian Sea via ship ballast in 1999 and which rapidly consumes <strong>zooplankton</strong> as well as fish eggs and young (1) (9) (13).,A range of measures have been put in place during the last century to protect the Caspian seal such as a ban on seal nets and restrictions on hunting including the protection of adult females during the breeding season (1) (11). However legal hunting for commercial and scientific purposes still continues (1). A number of conservation projects are in place in the region including the Caspian Environment Programme (CEP) which aims to halt environmental degradation in the Caspian Sea and promote sustainable development (4) (7) and the Caspian Seal Project which is supported by bodies such as the UK Darwin Initiative and which aims to monitor the Caspian seal population work for its conservation and raise its profile as a flagship species for the region. As part of this a Seal Conservation Action and Management Plan (SCAMP) has been developed although its most important recommendations have yet to be implemented (1) (9). The Caspian Seal Conservation Network (CSCN) is also coordinating research into the species (9). ,loss;hunting;poaching;fishing;disease; ,protected; ,5,190,Caucasus viper,Vipera kaznakovi,Caucasian viper (Vipera kaznakovi),Animalia,Chordata,Reptilia,Squamata,Viperidae,Vipera (1),Body length: up to 60 cm (2),For centuries fear-driven human persecution of the Caucasian viper has diminished population numbers (2). Today this snake is also threatened by illegal capture for the international pet trade habitat loss to urbanisation agriculture dam construction in Georgia and increased tourism-based development on the coast of the Black Sea (1). As a result of these threats populations have declined significantly and some have been lost altogether. If this rate of decline continues the Caucasian viper population is likely to be halved by 2018 (1).,The Caucasian viper is subject to state and regional level legal protection (7) and some areas of its habitat are protected such as Soci National Park which contains Russia\xe2\x80\x99s largest population of the Caucasian viper. Other protected areas such as Kackazsky State Biosphere Reserve Russia are home to small populations but these remain threatened as these reserves are also tourist destinations. Education of visitors and park staff is therefore vital in areas such as these to allow conservation of the Caucasian viper (7). A few individuals of the species also occur in small protected areas in Turkey and Georgia although overall most Caucasian viper populations remain unprotected (1) (7). Therefore it is thought an increase in the extent and quality of reserves is needed including international cooperation to establish a network of protected areas along the coast of the Black Sea (7). ,loss;pet; ,protected; ,2,191,Cayman Island ground iguana; Grand Cayman blue iguana; Grand Cayman iguana,Cyclura lewisi,Cayman Island blue iguana (Cyclura lewisi),Animalia,Chordata,Reptilia,Squamata,Iguanidae,Cyclura (1),Male snout-to-vent length: up to 51.5 cm (2)Female snout-to-vent length: up to 41.0 cm (2),Once abundant the Cayman Island blue iguana has been quietly heading for extinction in the wild since the colonization of the West Indian islands (4). Like other iguana species this beautiful creature is subject to many human-related threats including: destruction of habitats for farming residential and commercial developments; road casualties; trapping or shooting by farmers who perceive iguanas as a threat to their crops; and predation by wild and domestic cats and dogs (4) (7). Large scale deforestation and road construction has also increased enormously in the eastern districts over the last decade and is only expected to accelerate (7).,The Cayman Island blue iguana is fully protected under local legislation and kept out of international trade by its listing on Appendix I of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) (1). The National Trust for the Cayman Islands has established an integrated conservation programme incorporating research habitat protection captive breeding re-introduction/restocking and conservation education (7). These iguanas are being bred successfully in captivity and are subsequently released after two years into the Queen Elizabeth II Botanic Park and Salina Reserve (1) (4). Blue iguana populations in this reserve are being promoted as a major ecotourism attraction proving beneficial to both the Park and the iguanas (1). It seems that the future of wild blue iguanas must rest on managed populations in protected areas but suitable land is scarce on Grand Cayman (4). Thus despite encouraging conservation efforts the Cayman Island blue iguana still clings to a precarious existence (5) and more protected land must be obtained if there is any hope of securing its future in the wild (4). , ,cites;captive breeding;protected; ,0,392,Giant peccary; tagua,Catagonus wagneri,Chacoan peccary (Catagonus wagneri),Animalia,Chordata,Mammalia,Cetartiodactyla,Tayassuidae,Catagonus (1),29.5 - 40 kg cm (2),The recent decline in the range and numbers of this species is due to a number of factors including hunting for meat habitat destruction disease and predation by larger felids like jaguars <i>(Panthera onca) </i>(4). All species of peccary in the Gran Chaco are hunted for their meat by local people even in the national parks. This species is particularly susceptible as they frequently dust bathe in groups in open spaces including on roads and often react to danger by standing their ground rather than fleeing. This behaviour enables hunters to eliminate whole groups in one encounter (4).,Hunting of all wildlife in Paraguay is officially prohibited and its exportation in Argentina is illegal. However such regulations seem to be ignored and un-enforced as hunting of the Chacoan peccary exists across its range.

By 1880 the species was restricted to around ten hectares of woody vegetation on a mammal-free rock-stack known as Little Mangere Island (5). Habitat loss on this island further threatened the species however and prompted an intensive conservation programme that began in the 1970s (5). Today a population of around 250 to 300 birds exists on two small islands: Mangere and Rangatira (or South East) Islands (6). Although all are descended from just one pair and are genetically identical there are no apparent deleterious effects resulting from their small gene pool (6). The possibility of accidental predator introduction remains a threat (2).,In the 1970s habitat loss on Little Mangere Island was so severe that the population of seven birds was moved to Mangere Island. By 1980 however the situation had reached crisis point with only five birds left in the world including only a single breeding pair (5). The New Zealand Wildlife Service began '<strong>cross-fostering</strong>' eggs and young from this remaining pair of robins (known as 'old blue' and 'old yellow') to another species in an effort to increase productivity (4) (5). This innovative approach was a resounding success; today between 250 and 300 birds are distributed on Mangere and Rangatira Islands and there are plans to introduce a population to the much larger Pitt Island once it has been cleared of pests (4) (6). This is a remarkable conservation success story and an example of what can be achieved (5). ,loss; , ,1,095,Chatham Island petrel; Chatham Islands petrel,Pterodroma axillaris,Chatham petrel (Pterodroma axillaris),Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Procellariiformes,Procellariidae,Pterodroma (1),200 g (2),The main threat to the Chatham petrel is competition for burrows with the broad-billed prion (<em>Pachyptila vittata</em>) which breeds earlier in the year leaving the Chatham petrel at a competitive disadvantage (7). The broad-billed prion is also known to attack eggs chicks and occasionally adults causing burrow evictions and high rates of mortality in young Chatham petrels (10). Broad-billed prion interference has also been proposed as a contributing factor in pair bond disruption (4).,Intensive research into the reasons for the decline of the Chatham petrel in the last two decades has led to several conservation actions. Breeding burrows have been artificially blockaded to prevent occupation by the competing broad-billed prion and any prions found invading petrel burrows during absences are culled. Installation of neoprene flaps to burrow entrances has helped reduce broad-billed prion interference during the incubation period and continual burrow monitoring and artificial nest site protection has significantly improved Chatham petrel breeding success (11). ,loss;invasive;pet; ,protected; ,3,196,Amazilia Ventricastaí€Œ±a,Amazilia castaneiventris,Chestnut-bellied hummingbird (Amazilia castaneiventris),Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Apodiformes,Trochilidae,Amazilia (1),Average head-body length: 9 cm (2),Inhabiting a region with a large human population and intensive agriculture the chestnut-bellied hummingbird is suffering from extensive habitat loss. The status of this species has been somewhat unclear having been unrecorded over recent decades but it is now obvious that this rare species occupies a vulnerable position in a number of small fragmented populations (4). Deforestation has become progressively prevalent in the Colombian Andes with large tracts of forest replaced by coffee and sugarcane plantations pasture and crop cultivation (5) (7). Mining activity largely stimulated by a gold rush in 1996 has also had negative effects on the environment through habitat loss pollution and increased human immigration (4) (7).,Fortunately for the chestnut-bellied hummingbird it is the target of numerous conservation measures. Since 2002 the Colombian conservation organisations Fundaci\xc3\xb3n Colibri Organizacion Ambiental Ocotea and Fundacion Ecodiversidad have been directing community involvement projects in a reserve that supports the species. In 2008 they also began a banding and nest monitoring scheme and have undertaken awareness campaigns involving school children (8). Furthermore Fundaci\xc3\xb3n ProAves in collaboration with the Amercian Bird Conservancy have successfully created the Pauxi Pauxi reserve and the Cerulean Warbler Reserve and are working to protect the forests there (9).

Potential threats to the habitat in the Zapata region include drainage the expansion of agriculture and the associated pollution. Logging and grazing in swamps also alters the habitat to which the Cuban sparrow is adapted to (5). Subspecies <i>T.i.varonai</i> is threatened by habitat loss resulting from the expansion of the tourism industry and the cactus scrub habitat in Guantanamo is threatened by grazing felling of trees and the habitat conversion associated with increased urbanization (5).,Each of the subspecies has been recorded occurring within a protected area. For example in Zapata there is a UNESCO Biosphere Reserve a Ramsar site and also the Zapata Peninsula National Park. However the level of actual protection they offer the Cuban sparrow is variable. Increased protection to the areas they inhabit as well as investigation into proposed developments in these regions with steps taken to reduce the impact on Cuban sparrows is recommended to protect the future of this endangered bird (4). ,loss;pollution; ,protected; ,2,1113,Atlas gazelle; Edmi; mountain gazelle,Gazella cuvieri,Cuvierí¢ŒóŒ»s gazelle (Gazella cuvieri),Animalia,Chordata,Mammalia,Cetartiodactyla,Bovidae,Gazella (1),Shoulder height: 68 cm (2)Weight of males: 20 í¢ŒóŒñ 35 kg (2)Weight of females: 15 í¢ŒóŒñ 20 kg (2),The decline of Cuvier\xe2\x80\x99s gazelle in the first half of the 20th Century was caused by hunting for skins meat and sport.

Two big quarries are in continuous operation on western Milos which have considerably increased in size over the last 15 years and destroyed large areas of pristine habitat. Additionally there are plans for more quarries on western Milos which pose an extremely significant threat to this critically endangered species. Fires also cause habitat destruction destroying the large bushes and trees in which the main prey birds are found. During the period of \xe2\x80\x98reforestation\xe2\x80\x99 after a fire goat and sheep grazing can be highly destructive preventing trees and large bushes from growing. At present tourism does not threaten the snake\xe2\x80\x99s habitat but a new airport planned for Milos may increase tourism to a level that is damaging to viper habitats. The other islands appear to provide fairly pristine untouched habitat and the populations there are healthy although a little smaller than on Milos (2).,The Regional Development Agency of Cyclades is implementing a project called \xe2\x80\x98Protection and Promotion of the Habitats and Species of the Milos Island Natura 2000 Area\xe2\x80\x99 focussing on three main actions. Firstly monitoring of the region\xe2\x80\x99s habitats and species including this viper are to be ongoing. Secondly efforts will be made to raise public awareness of the threats that face Milos\xe2\x80\x99 flora and fauna including promoting Milos Island as a destination of great ecological and ecotourism value (6). Not only could the dissemination of information help reduce intentional killing of the snake but it could also help instil a sense of pride in the local fauna and encourage local inhabitants to support the police in their struggle against snake hunters (2). Finally roads will be made safer for crossing vipers through the construction of barriers and underground passages. The Standing Committee of the Bern Convention has also recommended that there is stronger and stricter police control of illegal trade in the species (6). Further conservation actions advocated include the establishment of protected areas with optimal habitats and connective corridors and the eradication of feral cats if studies verify the threat they pose to young snakes (2). A captive breeding programme has been started in collaboration with Jersey Zoo and a similar programme has been proposed for Budapest Zoo and Botanical Gardens (3) which will provide an important buffer against extinction and offer potential for future reintroductions into the wild. ,pet; ,captive breeding;protected; ,1,2126,Huchen,Hucho hucho,Danube salmon (Hucho hucho),Animalia,Chordata,Actinopterygii,Salmoniformes,Salmonidae,Hucho (1),up to 53 kg (2),Once widespread the Danube salmon is now amongst the most endangered fish species in Europe (3) (8). Numbers have been massively depleted due to overexploitation industrial and agricultural pollution deforestation (causing increased water temperatures) water redirection and badly designed or non-existent fish ladders in dams and reservoirs (2) (6). Barriers and dams are major obstacles for spawning fish and prevent genetic exchange between sub-populations (8). In addition the fish\xe2\x80\x99s popularity with anglers as a sports fish has probably also contributed to the species\xe2\x80\x99 decline (2). As a result of these combined threats the Danube salmon is now common in only around 33% of its former range rare in 28 % and has disappeared completely from 39 % (4).,Conservation efforts to date have involved the establishment of reserves restocking of populations and introductions into rivers not previously inhabited by the species legal restrictions on fishing times and quotas and even a total ban on fishing the Danube salmon in most European countries (4) (6). Unfortunately none of the measures have had long-term success partly due to the continuing pollution of rivers (4) (6). It has therefore been advocated that total protection should be given to the Danube salmon\xe2\x80\x99s habitat with particular focus on the halting of pollution and that more ecologically sound fishery management protocols be implemented (6). ,pollution; , ,1,0127,Deignaní¢ŒóŒ»s tree skink; Deignan's lankaskink,Lankascincus deignani,Deignan tree skink (Lankascincus deignani),Animalia,Chordata,Reptilia,Squamata,Scincidae,Lankascincus (1),Snout-vent length: 4 - 5.8 cm (2),The Deignan tree skink is considered to be under threat due to its very restricted distribution and the specific and highly fragmented nature of its habitat.

The Government of Kerala has introduced regulations for catch limits and restrictions on the use of fishing gear while plans have been developed for designated no-take zones and specific Denison barb sanctuaries.

Predation by introduced mammals such as foxes and cats are also considered a threat to this species (4).,In 1992 a recovery plan for this species was developed by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources (IUCN) addressing the threats facing this species (4). Predation by foxes and cats has now been brought under control by The Department of Conservation and Land Management (CALM) and in the last decade dibbler numbers have started to increase (5). Perth Zoo has been working with CALM to establish a captive breeding stock of over 100 individuals of this species (6). They have also translocated a group of dibblers to Escape Island; a predator free island which has suitable habitat for this marsupial. Here radio tracking devices and trapping practices will be used to monitor the populations (5). Considering that the dibbler was on the brink of extinction this recovery plan has been a great success. It is however essential to maintain these conservation efforts as the dibbler is still regarded as a severely endangered animal (1). ,fragmentation; ,captive breeding; ,1,1133,Chalcides polylepis,Chalcides parallelus,Doumergue's skink (Chalcides parallelus),Animalia,Chordata,Reptilia,Squamata,Scincidae,Chalcides (1),Length: up to 9.1 cm (2),Relatively little is known about the threats to Doumergue's skink. It is believed to be uncommon within its narrow and severely fragmented range and is likely to be under threat from the development of coastal areas for tourism and military purposes. Its habitat may also be declining in quality for example through the removal of ground cover as driftwood is collected for fuel. The species is not known to exist in modified habitats (1).,Doumergue\xe2\x80\x99s skink occurs in the Chafarine Hunting Reserve in the Chafarinas islands Spain as well as in the Sebkha Bou Areg and Embouchure Moulouya protected areas in Morocco (1). However no specific conservation measures are known to be in place for this small reptile and further research into its ecology life history and the threats it faces are likely to be needed if the species is to be given effective protection. , ,protected; ,0,1134,Dril,Mandrillus leucophaeus,Drill (Mandrillus leucophaeus),Animalia,Chordata,Mammalia,Primates,Cercopithecidae,Mandrillus (1),Head-body length: 70 cm (5)Male weight: 20 kg (5)Female weight: 12.5 kg (5),The mature rainforest in this equatorial region of Africa has been destroyed at an alarming rate causing many species to become endangered. The drill is under additional pressure from hunting as the sweet 'bushmeat' of this species is an important income for many people in the region (3).

Dramatic population declines have occurred in some areas with declines of over 99 percent recorded between 1976 to 1977 and 1996 to 1997 and the dumb gulper shark may now only be present in reasonable numbers in areas that cannot be trawled. <em>Centrophorus</em> species are harvested for meat and liver oil but the low reproductive rate late age of maturity and long lifespan typical of these deep-water sharks means that species such as the dumb gulper shark are unable to recover quickly after depletion (1).,In 2003 management changes to the South East Trawl Fishery (SETF) by the Australian Fisheries Management Authority brought in new limits to the permissible catch of dumb gulper sharks. In addition the livers of <em>Centrophorus</em> species were not allowed to be retained unless the carcasses from which they were obtained were also landed. In Australia recommendations have also been made to list the dumb gulper shark as an Endangered species on the Environmental Protection and Biodiversity Conservation (EPBC) Act a listing that would require that a Recovery Plan be put in place for this little-known deepwater shark (1). ,fishing; , ,1,0137,Dusky perch,Epinephelus marginatus,Dusky grouper (Epinephelus marginatus),Animalia,Chordata,Actinopterygii,Perciformes,Serranidae,Epinephelus (1),up to 60 kg (2),As a popular food fish the primary threat to the dusky grouper is over exploitation from commercial fisheries across its range (1) although adult fish are also caught as trophies particularly by spearfishing (9). Over-fishing and spearfishing have caused a dramatic decline in numbers over the last few decades leaving dusky grouper populations seriously depleted mainly in the north-western Mediterranean (5). The slow growth rate late onset of maturity and complex reproductive biology of this species compound these threats by making it harder for it to withstand or recover from high fishing pressure (1). The fact that it also forms <strong>spawning</strong> aggregations combined with its large size makes this fish particularly easy to catch and therefore vulnerable to over-harvesting (1). Indeed despite insufficient data from many range countries alarming declines have been recorded in Europe and the Mediterranean (mainly north-western) and there are also reports that <strong>spawning</strong> aggregations are being specifically targeted in Brazil (1).,Spearfishing of this species has been banned since 1993 in France (Mediterranean coast only) with evidence of small recoveries in this area (1). A number of Marine Protected Areas have also been established where the habitat of the fish is protected or where fishing is prohibited (1) (9). In South Africa the dusky grouper is part of a \xe2\x80\x98restricted group\xe2\x80\x99 of species governed by a bag limit of five fish a day (1). Additionally the dusky grouper was recently added to the endangered <strong>teleost</strong> list in Annex 3 to the Berne Convention (1996) under which management measures must be planned and aquaculture maintaining and breeding techniques developed in order to increase and repopulate endangered stocks (5). Unfortunately this fish does not adapt well to living and reproducing in aquariums (2) and research into successful husbandry techniques is therefore ongoing (5). ,fishing; ,protected; ,1,1138,Edmund,Ophiogomphus edmundo,Edmund's snaketail (Ophiogomphus edmundo),Animalia,Arthropoda,Insecta,Odonata,Gomphidae,Ophiogomphus (1),Length: 4.5 - 4.8 cm (2),Edmund\xe2\x80\x99s snaketail is threatened by the impounding and channelling of water to develop dams and reservoirs for hydroelectric schemes irrigation and water supplies. Siltation drainage and pollution also pose further threats to this species as they destroy freshwater habitats by lowering the water table sometimes turning permanent waterbodies into temporary water sources (1) (3) (8).,The Conasauga River runs through fairly rugged inaccessible country in national forests in Tennessee and Georgia which affords some level of protection to Edmund\xe2\x80\x99s snaketail in these areas.

In Africa declines have been caused by the loss of wild <strong>ungulate</strong> populations and in some areas overgrazing by livestock (5).  In Europe the Egyptian vulture has been suffering severe long-term declines; the result of disturbance lead poisoning from gun shot direct poisoning and electrocution by powerlines as well as regulations introduced within the European Union to control the disposal of animal carcasses which have greatly reduced food availability for this scavenger.  In addition Avian pox has been cited as the cause of Egyptian vulture deaths in Bulgaria (5).  In India diclofenac an anti-inflammatory drug often used for livestock is likely to be the source of recent and extremely rapid declines in Egyptian vulture populations (5) (7).  This drug which is also responsible for devastating declines in other vulture species poisons vultures when they feed on the flesh of treated livestock (8).,Throughout its range the Egyptian vulture occurs in a number of protected areas as well as being the subject of monitoring supplementary feeding programmes and campaigns against the illegal use of poisons (5).  In 2006 manufacture of the veterinary form of the drug diclofenac was banned by the Indian Nepali and Pakistani governments (9) (10).  While this was a remarkable step forward in vulture conservation the drug remains widely available and the human form of the drug is sometimes being used to treat livestock instead (9).    Many more measures may be necessary if the long-term survival of the Egyptian vulture is to be assured.  BirdLife International recommends relaxing European Union regulations with regards to the disposal of animal carcasses lobbying for the ban of diclofenac throughout the species range and protecting nest sites as just some of the measures which would benefit the Egyptian vulture (5). ,loss; ,protected; ,1,1140,Cotorra de El Oro; Perico de El Oro,Pyrrhura orcesi,El Oro parakeet (Pyrrhura orcesi),Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Psittaciformes,Psittacidae,Pyrrhura (1),Length: 22 cm (2),Deforestation associated with logging and clearance of trees for agriculture is a huge threat to the survival of the El Oro Parakeet. Although high altitude <strong>cloud forest</strong> is being deforested at a much slower rate this species is largely restricted to the more accessible lower altitude forest (2) (7). As habitat becomes more and more fragmented so the sub-populations are becoming more and more isolated and vulnerable. In 2006 the total population of El Oro parakeets was estimated to be less than 1000 birds (2).,In the past decade around 1500 hectares of forest has been acquired by the Jocotoco Foundation at Buenaventura the locality in which the El Oro parakeet was first discovered (2) (7) (8). Now known as the Buenaventura Reserve it is one of the richest ornithological regions of Ecuador and the only well protected site in which the El Oro parakeet occurs (7) (8). Approximately 80 El Oro parakeets are year-round occupants of the reserve but at certain times of the year the total number rises to around 120 (7) (9). The long-term aim is to expand the reserve to 5000 hectares and implement an environmental awareness campaign that will encourage and engage local people in conservation (2) (7) (8). , ,protected; ,0,1141,Brow-antlered deer; thamin,Rucervus eldii,Eldí¢ŒóŒ»s deer (Rucervus eldii),Animalia,Chordata,Mammalia,Cetartiodactyla,Cervidae,Rucervus (1),up to 150 kg (2),Eld\xe2\x80\x99s deer are widely hunted as food and for their antlers (6). In particular Eld\xe2\x80\x99s deer are thought to have been hunted to feed the armies during many Asian wars (10). They are a prized game animal because of their impressive antlers and hides which are sold in the local markets (6). Habitat destruction due to expanding agriculture has also had a major impact on this rare species. In Manipur the Manipur brow-antlered deer (<i>R. e. eldii</i>) population has declined primarily due to wetland reclamation for grazing cultivation and fish farming (6). Very little suitable habitat is protected; only one percent of the protected forests in Southeast Asia are suitable for Eld\xe2\x80\x99s deer (11). Even within protected areas these threats continue. The Chatthin Wildlife Sanctuary Myanmar is one of the last strongholds of the species yet the <strong>dipterocarp</strong> forest within it continues to be degraded under great pressure from local communities for cropland and timber (7). Sadly there is often a lack of funding and political will for protection (12). Due to their highly fragmented distribution this species is also at risk from <strong>inbreeding</strong> and loss of genetic variation (12).,Eld\xe2\x80\x99s deer occur in a number of protected areas throughout its range. The entire Manipur brow-antlered deer (<i>R. e. eldii</i>) population now resides within Keibul Lamjao National Park Manipur (1) created in 1977 specifically to protect this <strong>subspecies</strong> (6). Additionally local projects have helped raise public awareness and support for conserving the deer (6). Hainan Datian Nature Reserve on Hainan Island China was established in 1976 specifically to help the Thailand brow-antlered deer (<i>R. e. siamensis</i>) <strong>subspecies</strong> recover with the population now growing an average of 15 percent annually (8). This population has become so large in fact that large numbers have been translocated to other parts of the island (8). Kyatthin and Shwesettaw Wildlife Sanctuaries were established in Myanmar to protect the Burmese brow-antlered deer (<i>R. e. thamin</i>) <strong>subspecies</strong> and a community education project was initiated in 1995 to raise local awareness about the plight of the deer and the protected status of the Kyatthin Wildlife Sanctuary (6). Captive populations exist around the world but <strong>inbreeding</strong> is common and cooperative <strong>cross-breeding</strong> is required if captive populations are to be genetically varied enough for any future reintroduction programmes into the wild (12). ,loss; ,protected; ,1,1142,Sanghir sunbird,Aethopyga duyvenbodei,Elegant sunbird (Aethopyga duyvenbodei),Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Nectariniidae,Aethopyga (1),Length: 12 cm (2),When the tiny island of Sangihe was first colonised in the 17<sup>th </sup>century its forests were plundered for their natural resources of fruit spices and fibres. When these were gone the forests were replaced with plantations of bananas coconuts rubber and tea (7). After centuries of agriculture Sangihe has now been almost entirely stripped of forest and only tiny patches remain (6) (8). Naturally this has had a great impact on the island\xe2\x80\x99s wildlife including the elegant sunbird.,Action Sampiri a UK-based conservation group has been working to promote wildlife conservation on Sangihe since 1995 by conducting fieldwork running education and awareness programmes and developing ideas for future land-use that may be mutually beneficial to the local people and wildlife (2). The <strong>primary forest</strong> fragment at Mount Sahendaruman is nominally protected although action is limited (2) and forest in the Kentuhang valley also receives some protection as part of a <strong>watershed</strong> for a hydroelectric scheme (2). Improved effective protection of the forest at Mount Sahendaruman has been recommended (2) a measure that would not only help the elegant sunbird but also the other highly threatened species clinging to existence in this tiny patch of forest.\xa0 , ,protected; ,0,1143,pineapple tortoise; red-nosed tortoise; yellow tortoise; yellow-headed tortoise,Indotestudo elongata,Elongated tortoise (Indotestudo elongata),Animalia,Chordata,Reptilia,Testudines,Testudinidae,Indotestudo (1),3.5 kg (2),The elongated tortoise is under extreme pressure across most of its range largely\xa0due to it being widely harvested and sold on the Asian food markets (2).

The vegetation in the Yavello Wildlife Sanctuary has been shown to have become much denser between 1986 and 2002 as a result of the enforcement of fire suppression and this is thought to be the cause of the decline in Ethiopian bush-crows. Partial clearance of scrub for cattle grazing space appears to have benefited the crow but intensive clearing of scrub for firewood and grazing is said to be having a negative impact elsewhere. The spread of cultivated land is also reducing suitable habitat (2).,A detailed study of the Ethiopian bush-crow\xe2\x80\x99s ecology and habitat requirements is currently underway and it is hoped that this might shed light on the effect of clearing <i>Acacia</i>. Yavello Sanctuary was created in order to protect this species and the white-tailed swallow (<i>Hirundo megaensis</i>) but there is no active management and the sanctuary has been deemed a failure. Responsibility for the area has now been transferred to the regional government and it is hoped that in collaboration with the local communities the sanctuary will become highly valuable and act as a stronghold for both of these important species (2). , , ,0,0145,Abyssinian wolf; Simien fox; Simien jackal,Canis simensis,Ethiopian wolf (Canis simensis),Animalia,Chordata,Mammalia,Carnivora,Canidae,Canis (1),11 - 20 kg (2),The Ethiopian wolf has been reduced to a handful of mountain ranges due to pressures on the habitat particularly conversion to agriculture (2). As populations have become increasingly isolated by the fragmentation of their habitat the likelihood of local extinctions has increased. Rabies and distemper transmitted from domestic dogs to the wolves and <strong>hybridisation</strong> resulting from breeding with domestic dogs further threatens the survival of this species (4) (6).,Determined conservation efforts are needed in order to ensure the long-term survival of the remaining Ethiopian wolf populations. The Ethiopian Wolf Conservation Programme (EWCP) is a joint long-term project between the Wildlife Conservation Research Unit at Oxford University the Born Free Foundation and the Ethiopian Wildlife Conservation Organisation under the aegis of the IUCN Canid Specialist Group (4). The EWCP carries out vital conservation measures in the field working closely with local people and undertakes population monitoring and other needed research. Some of the activities undertaken so far in the Bale Mountains include assistance with park management in Bale vaccination and sterilisation of local dogs education programmes and tourism development (4) and the EWCP team has now expanded its activities to all wolf populations in the north of the country (7). ,fragmentation; , ,1,0146,Testudo euphratica; Trionyx euphraticus,Rafetus euphraticus,Euphrates softshell turtle (Rafetus euphraticus),Animalia,Chordata,Reptilia,Testudines,Trionychidae,Rafetus (1),Length: up to 68 cm (2),Habitat destruction caused by damming projects along the Tigris and Euphrates rivers is a major threat to the Euphrates softshell turtle (2) (6) (8).,Proposed conservation measures include further studies into the biology and habitats of the Euphrates softshell turtle as well as into the relationship between this species and local communities (5). ,poaching;environment;pollution; , ,3,0147,Evrotas dace,Squalius keadicus,European dace (Squalius keadicus),Animalia,Chordata,Actinopterygii,Cypriniformes,Cyprinidae,Squalius (1),Maximum length: 25 cm (2),Restricted to just a single river the European dace is primarily threatened by the loss of its habitat. Although the Evrotas River naturally dries up during periods of drought water extraction for agriculture has exacerbated this resulting in fish being stranded in stagnant pools of water with low oxygen concentration and high temperatures (1) (6). This was most severe in 2007 when a prolonged drought resulted in around 80 percent of the main river course drying up (6). As the European dace inhabits fast flowing cold waters mass fish mortality has been observed in areas where its habitat has been degraded in such a way (5). Fish communities within the Evrotas River have also suffered from pollution with lowland parts of the river often near urban areas being the most severely effected (1) (6).,The Evrotas River home to the European dace is a unique biodiversity hotspot within Greece. Its waters support many <strong>endemic</strong> species of plants and fish and consequently protecting this fragile environment is a key conservation priority (6). The importance of this river and a plan for its conservation is outlined in the EU Water Framework Directive. This requires habitat monitoring and management programmes to be implemented whilst tackling the threats to the river (6) (7). Furthermore establishing protected areas and developing sustainable water management plans will be crucial in preserving the European dace for the future (1) (2). ,loss;pollution; ,protected; ,2,1148,rock-cress,Phlebolobium maclovianum,Falklands rock cress (Phlebolobium maclovianum),Plantae,Tracheophyta,Magnoliopsida,Capparales,Cruciferae,Phlebolobium (1),Height: 45 - 60 cm (2),The biggest threat to the Falklands rock cress is grazing. In the past overgrazing by sheep and other livestock has caused the Falklands rock cress to undergo a major decline\xa0and it now only exists in small localised patches.

Intensive hunting in some areas especially Sumatra in the mid 20th Century also contributed greatly to the decline in population numbers (3). Further threats come from fishing practices with false gharials either becoming caught in nets poisoned by toxins used to kill fish or else loosing their food source to local fishermen (2).,International trade in the false gharial is prevented by its listing on Appendix I of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) (1) and many of the known populations occur within protected areas (3). Recent population estimates of the false gharial are under 2500 mature adults but data on distribution is still insufficient (2). Before a successful conservation management plan can be implemented more information needs to be collected on the current status of this species in Malaysia and Indonesia. Further research into behaviour and ecology must be carried out in order to identify priority habitats and population needs (3).

Destructive fishing practices have also greatly reduced the fishing cat\xe2\x80\x99s main prey base. Additionally fishing cats are hunted for food medicine and body parts in some areas of their range and have been persecuted for taking domestic stock (1). The skin of the fishing cat has occasionally been observed in Asian markets although far less frequently than other cats (4).,The Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) lists the fishing cat on Appendix II under which permits are required for international traffic in this species (5). The fishing cat is also protected by national legislation over most of its range with the exception of Bhutan Malaysia and Vietnam (4). Legal protection is extremely difficult to enforce however and illegal poaching does take place (4) (5). In addition to enforcing protective legislation for this species it is crucial that there is protection of its wetland habitat. Habitat degradation has been the most significant contributor to the decline in numbers and this must be addressed if we are to maintain populations of this beautiful and extraordinary cat throughout its range across southern and southeast Asia. ,hunting;fishing;pollution; ,cites;protected; ,3,2152,Oaxacan spinytail iguana; Oaxacan spiny-tailed iguana,Ctenosaura quinquecariniata,Five-keeled spiny-tailed iguana (Ctenosaura quinquecariniata),Animalia,Chordata,Reptilia,Squamata,Iguanidae,Ctenosaura (1),Total male length: c. 47.5 cm (2)Total female length: c. 32 cm (2),The population of five-keeled spiny-tailed iguanas could decline by as much as 30 percent if current rates of habitat loss are maintained.

In 1988 approximately four percent of Negros and eight percent of Panay remained forested and in the last 20 years the forest composition of both islands has almost certainly declined further. Given that only ten percent of the remaining forest occurs at a suitable altitude for this lowland bird it is no surprise that the flame-templed babbler is classified as Endangered on the IUCN Red List (2). While it is considered relatively tolerant of <strong>secondary growth</strong> the rate of clearance is so rapid that its ability to survive in degraded forests is more and more limited (2) (4).,While the flame-templed babbler occurs within existing and proposed national parks on both Negros and Panay there are no specific conservation measures in place for this species (2) (7). Further surveys and studies are required to establish the location of important sites and the capacity of the species to survive in degraded habitats.

With the cessation of hostilities in 2002 pressure on the forest will again increase as demand for agricultural land grows (4).  A growth in subsistence agriculture now poses the greatest threat to the Gabela akalat and other forest-dwelling birds of the region (2) (4).  In some areas 20 to 70 percent of canopy trees and all the undergrowth in valley bottoms are being cleared to plant bananas and sweet potatoes.  In other areas up to 95 percent of the forest canopy is being removed to plant cassava and maize (2).  In addition the re-establishment of coffee plantations would also have serious impacts on the Gabela akalat particularly if varieties that require shade (which thrive beneath the canopy of forests) were replaced by sun-tolerant varieties (which results in the destruction of the forest canopy) (4).,For the duration of the protracted civil war very little scientific research was undertaken in Angola.  Since the war was formally ended in 2002 surveys to determine the Gabela akalat\xe2\x80\x99s population size and distribution could now be carried out (2).  Ascertaining the call of this shy bird would be extremely useful in any future surveys that are undertaken; in 2004 a group of scientists first recorded a call emanating from the location of a Gabela akalat but more work is needed to confirm its repertoire (4).

In some parts of its habitat 20 to 70 percent of canopy trees and all the undergrowth in valley bottoms is being cleared to plant bananas and sweet potatoes. In other areas up to 95 percent of the forest canopy is being removed to plant cassava and maize (8). While the Gabela bush-shrike is said to be fairly tolerant of degraded habitats (4) (7) numbers of this species are still believed to have declined over recent years (2).,The protection of a 50 square kilometre area inhabited by the Gabela bush-shrike was recommended in the early 1970s (8) as it is home to several endangered birds (4) but this has not yet been established (8). The creation of a protected area to ensure the survival of the Gabela bush-shrike remains a priority and a number of other conservation measures have also been recommended. These include conducting surveys to determine the Gabela bush-shrike\xe2\x80\x99s distribution and population size and studies to determine the species\xe2\x80\x99 habitat requirements.

Charcoal production is claiming large tracts of dry forest near the escarpment while other areas are being cleared to plant subsistence agricultural crops such as bananas sweet potato maize and cassava. In addition now that conflict has ended on the escarpment large-scale coffee planting and farming is now likely to resume claiming more of this imperilled bird\xe2\x80\x99s habitat (2).,The Gabela helmet-shrike is found in the Kissama National Park which affords a degree of protection against habitat destruction (2). Unfortunately however a proposal to create another protected area the Gabela Nature Reserve which would have helped to protect this species against the resumption of commercial activities on the escarpment has not materialised (2) (5). In order to ensure this species\xe2\x80\x99 survival surveys of its population and habitat should be conducted along with research into its ecology. In addition a conservation strategy for the Angolan escarpment and surrounding areas should be implemented including the promotion of ecotourism and a supplement to agriculture (2). , ,protected; ,0,1166,Galapagos Islands fur seal,Arctocephalus galapagoensis,Galapagos fur seal (Arctocephalus galapagoensis),Animalia,Chordata,Mammalia,Carnivora,Otariidae,Arctocephalus (1),Male length: up to 150 cm (2)Female length: up to 130 cm (2)Average male weight: 64 kg (3)Average female weight: 27 kg (3),During the 19th century the Galapagos fur seal was severely impacted by the large-scale commercial seal hunting that was rampant at the time (3) (8).

However the impact of these activities is negligible compared to the major threat of habitat degradation and destruction (4).,The geometric tortoise is protected by Western Cape Provincial legislation which is rigidly and effectively enforced (4) and it is listed on Appendix I of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) meaning that trade in this species is only permitted in exceptional circumstances (3).  In addition around 75 percent of the total population exists in formal protected areas (4) such as the Elandsberg Private Nature Reserve and a number of smaller provincial reserves (8).  However the majority of remaining geometric tortoise habitat is in the hands of private landowners and efforts are being made to secure the future of some of these sites through a conservation stewardship programme (13).  Captive breeding of the geometric tortoise has had limited success and is currently not considered a priority thus the primary focus of conservation efforts is to ensure its continued survival in the wild (4).  The continued enforcement of conservation legislation and vigilance towards the unscrupulous collection of animals for the pet trade is called for (2) while the maintenance of protected areas is essential.  In addition it is imperative that private landowners take custodianship of the last remaining <strong>renosterveld</strong> remnants that contain geometric tortoise populations in partnership with conservation agencies since it is practically not possible to buy enough land to protect formally (2).  Without such measures the <strong>renosterveld</strong> habitat and its endangered inhabitants may disappear completely. ,loss;invasive;pet; ,cites;captive breeding;protected; ,3,3178,Germainí¢ŒóŒ»s silver langur; Germainí¢ŒóŒ»s silver leaf monkey; Indochinese lutung; Indochinese silvered langur,Trachypithecus germaini,Germain's langur (Trachypithecus germaini),Animalia,Chordata,Mammalia,Primates,Cercopithecidae,Trachypithecus (1),Head-body length: 49 - 59 cm (2) (3)Tail length: 72 - 84 cm (2) (3),Although a relatively widespread species Germain\xe2\x80\x99s langur is very rare throughout most of its range (1) (3) and its population is believed to have more than halved in recent decades (1).

Some giant bushy-tailed cloud rats have also been captured to be kept as pets. The deterioration and loss of forest habitat may also be threatening this species (5) as commercial agriculture population growth and poverty in the Philippines forces people to clear forest for cultivation at increasingly high altitudes (9).,The giant bushy-tailed cloud rat occurs in several national parks in northern Luzon (8) including Mount Pulag National Park (3).

A decline in habitat quality particularly in the Mediterranean is also likely to be impacting populations of giant devilray though to what extent is not known (1). Its preference for inhabiting the surface of the oceans makes the giant devilray vulnerable to disturbance from maritime traffic and oil spills (1).,In 2005 the General Fisheries Commission for the Mediterranean adopted a measure to ban trawling below 1000 metres and banned driftnets throughout the Mediterranean (6). This is likely to have substantially reduced the threat of <strong>by-catch</strong> to the giant devilray in the Mediterranean. Raising awareness with fishermen to maximise the number of giant devilrays that are disentangled and released unharmed after accidental capture has also been recommended as an important measure to protect this magnificent oceanic animal (1). , , ,0,0181,Cuban flycatcher,Tyrannus cubensis,Giant kingbird (Tyrannus cubensis),Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Tyrannidae,Tyrannus (1),Length: 23 - 26 cm (2),While the giant kingbird occurs in naturally low densities it is becoming increasingly rare throughout Cuba.

Large areas of forest in this part of Asia have been cleared for timber and to make way for developments and agriculture and it may be that these monkeys are now mainly restricted to forest reserves which are themselves under threat from illegal logging (7).,International trade in this species is banned by its listing on Appendix I of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) (3). Golden langurs are protected within a number of reserves such as the Manas National Park in Assam; a World Heritage Site that has suffered from conflict in the past but which is now undergoing a rehabilitation programme (8).

The habitat of the golden lion tamarin has therefore been drastically reduced and fragmented into isolated patches. A former threat to the species in the wild came from the collection of live individuals for private collections and zoos (6) but this practice became illegal in the 1970s and subsequently decreased (5). Occasionally specimens will still turn up in a local market (5) but the pet trade now has relatively little impact on numbers (2). Further more captive breeding in zoos and subsequent <strong>re-introductions</strong> have literally helped save this species from extinction so its former collection for zoos has also had a very positive impact (2).,Fortunately the golden lion tamarin has been the subject of a large-scale determined conservation effort. A captive breeding programme aims to maintain a zoo population of 500 individuals and since 1984 captive-bred individuals have been re-introduced to the wild (6) (10). Furthermore released individuals have successfully reared young in the wild (6). A huge conservation education programme in Brazil has raised the profile of the golden lion tamarin and the species is now widely regarded with pride as a national symbol of conservation (10). In 1980 the wild population had reached an all time low of less than 100 individuals (11) but by 2000 this had increased to 1000 424 of which were re-introduced from captive stock (12). Despite these efforts the species still requires protection and continued conservation efforts if it is to evade extinction.

At the turn of the millennium just 1000 to 2500 golden parakeets were estimated to be remaining in the wild (2). Undoubtedly deforestation and rampant exploitation for the caged-bird trade are chiefly responsible for its precarious status (2) (5). Road construction development and logging have depleted and fragmented large areas of biologically rich rainforests which the golden parakeet utilises for nesting roosting and foraging (2) (4). At the same time with high demand for this species in the caged-bird trade illegal trapping continues apace (10). Sadly it is also hunted for food feathers and sport and to reduce damage to crops (2).,The golden parakeet is protected by Brazilian law and since 1973 has been listed under Appendix I of the Convention on International in Endangered Species (CITES) which permits trade in this species only under exceptional circumstances (2) (3). Unfortunately the human and financial resources available to prevent wildlife exploitation are limited and consequently illegal trapping remains prolific and many birds continue to be smuggled out of Brazil (6) (10). There is a population of golden parakeet in the fairly well protected Tapaj\xc3\xb3s National Park but reserves can be limited in their effectiveness because of this species\xe2\x80\x99 nomadic behaviour (2). There is cause for optimism however as in 2001 the Golden Conure Survival Fund was established (4) (8). This has been instrumental in raising significant funds to support much needed research into the species\xe2\x80\x99 population and threats. Furthermore it is anticipated that future funds will be used to help implement direct conservation initiatives such as land purchase education of local people and law enforcement (8) (9) (10). , ,cites;protected; ,0,2192,Sichuan golden snub-nosed monkey,Rhinopithecus roxellana,Golden snub-nosed monkey (Rhinopithecus roxellana),Animalia,Chordata,Mammalia,Primates,Cercopithecidae,Rhinopithecus (1),Head-body length: 57 - 76 cm (2)Tail length: 51 - 72 cm (2)Male weight: 15 í¢ŒóŒñ 39 kg (3)Female weight: 6.5 í¢ŒóŒñ 10 kg (3),The golden snub-nosed monkey has long been hunted for use in traditional medicines with the pelt of the species once thought to prevent rheumatism as well as for its fur and meat.

As a result of deforestation and hunting populations all over the Philippines have declined considerably and this species has vanished entirely from a number of islands (5).  The natural habitat of the Philippines is amongst the most threatened in the world with only six to seven percent of the original <strong>primary forest</strong> remaining largely due to extensive commercial logging (8).  This undoubtedly has had a significant impact on the golden-capped fruit bat which favours <strong>primary forest</strong> (5).,While the golden-capped fruit bat is thought to occur in some protected areas (5) further action is urgently needed to prevent the extinction of this species.  In 1992 an action plan developed for the conservation of Old World fruit bats outlined a number of conservation measures recommended for this species.  Due to the problems with enforcing any hunting controls the plan recommended that the most effective method of protection would be to manage colonies on small islands where suitable habitat remains and where protection efforts would have a better chance of success (5).  In 2003 the Philippine Endemic Species Conservation Project implemented a programme for the protection of the golden-capped fruit bat on the tiny island of Boracay off the northwest corner of Panay.  The project\xe2\x80\x99s achievements included nearly eliminating hunting of the colony (9).  In combination with conservation efforts in the wild captive breeding may eventually be necessary to ensure the long-term survival of the golden-capped fruit bat (5). ,hunting; ,captive breeding;protected; ,1,2195,Tattersall's sifaka,Propithecus tattersalli,Golden-crowned sifaka (Propithecus tattersalli),Animalia,Chordata,Mammalia,Primates,Indriidae,Propithecus (1),3.5 kg (2),Of all lemurs the golden-crowned sifaka has one of the most limited distributions (3). Vast tracts of their habitat have been cleared and the isolated patches of forest that remain are under pressure from logging and bush fires (2). The species is also hunted in some areas (2) and the recent discovery of gold in the region has resulted in an influx of miners causing further habitat loss and the hunting of lemurs for food (4).,Recent studies have shown that these sifakas are fairly abundant in some of the remaining forest fragments within their range and estimates put the population at between 6200 and 10000 individuals (7). Based on these figures it has been suggested that the World Conservation Union (IUCN) should reclassify the species as Endangered (7). At present the captive population of golden-crowned sifakas numbers just three at the Duke University Primate Centre (4). The species does not currently occur within a protected area (2) but is listed under Class A of the African Convention on the Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources whereby hunting killing capture or collection of individuals is forbidden unless for scientific purposes and with permission (6). A network of protected areas has been proposed to conserve the remaining forest fragments in which the golden-crowned sifaka is found (7). ,loss;hunting; ,protected; ,2,1196,Gold and black lion tamarind,Leontopithecus chrysomelas,Golden-headed lion tamarin (Leontopithecus chrysomelas),Animalia,Chordata,Mammalia,Primates,Callitrichidae,Leontopithecus (1),480 í¢ŒóŒñ 700 g (2),Golden-headed lion tamarins are among the world\xe2\x80\x99s most critically endangered mammals (8). Their habitat is one of the first to be cleared because they live in lowland forests. Currently only 2-5% of its original habitat remains (3) the rest being removed for timber or charcoal and to make way for plantations cattle pasture and industry (7). Eastern and South-eastern Brazil was also one of the first areas to be colonised almost 500 years ago and is now one of the most densely inhabited areas in Brazil exerting huge pressures on the land\xe2\x80\x99s resources (5) (8). Critically low numbers in the wild are due almost exclusively to habitat loss (2). This primate also suffers losses because of natural predators such as ocelots snakes hawks and eagles. In addition this species has suffered from trade as its amazing appearance makes it a prize pet and very popular in zoos (7) (9). However captive breeding in zoos and subsequent reintroductions have also helped save this species from extinction so its former collection for zoos has also had a very positive impact (2). Since it has been listed as Endangered by the IUCN and hunting and trade of the species has been banned (1) (4) it is hoped that hunting no longer poses a threat though sadly there are still occasional reports of illegal trade in this species (7). Deforestation and habitat loss however are more difficult problems to solve (6).,In the 1970s the numbers of these monkeys in zoos were declining as fast as those in the wild (5) (7). At this time researchers from the National Zoological Park in Washington DC developed techniques for successfully breeding this species in captivity and created a conservation plan to implement genetic and demographic management of the captive population involving long term studies of the species educating local communities about conservation efforts and increasing the extent of protected habitats (5). ,loss;hunting;pet; ,captive breeding;protected; ,3,2197,Golden-rumped sengi,Rhynchocyon chrysopygus,Golden-rumped elephant-shrew (Rhynchocyon chrysopygus),Animalia,Chordata,Mammalia,Macroscelidea,Macroscelididae,Rynchocyon (1),540 g (2),Numbers of the golden-rumped elephant-shrew are severely threatened by habitat destruction along the Kenyan coast. Forests are being relentlessly cleared for farming development and timber collection (4).

(8). Both threats have come about as a result of a change in fire regime in combination with cattle grazing (8). Fire is a feature of their natural environment and the parrots are a fire-dependent species with fire maintaining their habitat and the availability of essential foods (9). A lack of burning or burning at the wrong time of year in association with cattle grazing which has reduced fuel loads has resulted in the invasion of woodland throughout the species\xe2\x80\x99 former range. The increase in woody vegetation is thought to have favoured predators such as the pied butcherbird (<i>Cracticus nigrogularis</i>). Predation of adults is a major cause of nest failure with almost one third of nests losing one or more adults (2). The shortage of food that occurs annually during the wet season may be made worse by the lack of early wet season burning and selective grazing by introduced cattle of early-seeding perennial grasses (7) (5). In addition feral pigs preferentially eat the same important grass species and reduce recruitment of the termite mounds used for nesting (7). Intensive conservation efforts have stemmed the long-term decline of the golden-shouldered parrot in closely monitored sites but in less well-monitored sites the population is probably still declining (1) (7).,Golden-shouldered parrots have been studied in detail for over 16 years and during this time land and fire management have been adjusted across much of its range to suit the parrot\xe2\x80\x99s ecological requirements (9). Over these years completed or current management actions include analysis of threats changing fire regimes vegetation change annual monitoring and supplementary feeding of the Artemis Station population and surveys of populations and nests in the remainder of the bird\xe2\x80\x99s range. Other actions include fencing and implementation of favourable fire regimes on leasehold land and National Parks signing of a conservation agreement with land-holders and inclusion of conservation requirements for the species in property planning in central Cape York Peninsula (2). As a result of these measures the bird\xe2\x80\x99s range which contracted greatly between 1992 and 1998 may now have stabilized (9). A small proportion of the parrot\xe2\x80\x99s range occurs inside the Staaten River National Park and reintroductions into Mungkan Kandju National Park are also planned (9). It has been advocated that future conservation efforts focus on providing supplementary food during the wet-season developing and refining a pastoral management strategy and securing land under conservation agreements (2). It has been estimated that around 1500 golden-shouldered parrots are held in captivity in Australia (3) with considerable numbers bred in captivity each season (6). A sustainable future for this bird in captivity is therefore safeguarded ensuring that this beautiful parrot is with us for a long time to come (6). The bird\xe2\x80\x99s prospects in the wild however currently appear somewhat bleaker despite considerable conservation efforts and successes and far more needs to be done if this enchanting bird is to be saved in its natural habitat where it belongs. ,environment; , ,1,0199,Ornate tree-kangaroo,Dendrolagus goodfellowi,Goodfellowí¢ŒóŒ»s tree kangaroo (Dendrolagus goodfellowi),Animalia,Chordata,Mammalia,Diprotodontia,Macropodidae,Dendrolagus (1),6 to 10 kg (2),Goodfellow\xe2\x80\x99s tree kangaroo is considered Endangered as a result of over-hunting and habitat loss (3). Hunted for its meat this species appears to be extremely vulnerable to poaching having rapidly disappeared from areas of intensive hunting even by surprisingly small human populations (6). Dwindling habitat is also a major cause for concern with forest having been destroyed due to logging mining oil exploration and agriculture. Lowland rainforest has undergone extensive clearance and those populations still surviving in highland forest have been fragmented and isolated markedly limiting their opportunity for out-breeding (3).,Its occurrence in a reasonable number of National Parks and reserves has helped ensure the survival of Goodfellow\xe2\x80\x99s tree kangaroo as has the almost complete lack of any large tree-climbing predators or competitors (3).

However the species is still under serious threat from hunting and habitat loss with most of its habitat having already been converted to agriculture plantations and grazing land and the remaining forest reduced to tiny isolated patches (2) (3) (6) (7). The highly restricted and fragmented range of the gorgeted wood-quail encompassing an area no more than 280 kilometres in length together with its small population size makes it particularly vulnerable to any threats (2) (3).

As the Grand Comoro drongo is found only surrounding an active volcano a volcanic eruption could potentially have devastating consequences for this bird.,A protected area has been proposed for Mount Karthala but this has not yet been established (5). If such vital forest habitat is not protected there is a high risk of further habitat loss and possibly the loss of many <strong>endemic</strong> species including the Grand Comoro drongo. , ,protected; ,0,1202,Renala baobab,Adansonia grandidieri,Grandidierí¢ŒóŒ»s baobab (Adansonia grandidieri),Plantae,Tracheophyta,Magnoliopsida,Malvales,Bombacaceae,Adansonia (1),Height: 25 m (2)Diameter: 3 m (2),<i>Adansonia grandidieri</i> is the most heavily exploited of all the Malagasy baobabs (2).  The seeds and the vitamin C-rich fruit pulp are eaten fresh and cooking oil is extracted from the oil-rich seeds.  The fruit is either collected from the ground or wooden pegs are hammered into the trunk so the tree can be climbed to collect the fruit (2).  The thick bark of the baobab is composed of tough long fibres that can be used to make ropes and the majority of trees bear scars from where the bark was cut from ground level to about two meters to obtain this material (2).  The spongy wood is comprised of sheets of fibre that are collected from dead or living trees dried in the sun and sold for thatch (2).  Most of these varied uses do not involve the tree being killed and thus are unlikely to pose a great threat to the baobab.  The greatest threat to this species has come from the transformation of its forest habitat into agricultural land.  Within these disturbed habitats there is a noticeable lack of young trees.  Fires seed predation competition from weeds and an altered physical environment might be affecting the ability of the Madagacar baobab to reproduce (2) which may have devastating consequences for its survival.,Numerous non-governmental organisations and scientists along with the Malagasy government realise the importance of conserving the unique biodiversity of Madagascar and are working to protect this magnificent island and its diverse fauna and flora (4).  One measure from which Grandidier\xe2\x80\x99s baobab is likely to benefit is the designation of protected areas.  In 2003 the President of Madagascar vowed to triple the amount of protected areas (5); a pledge that won\xe2\x80\x99t only help the magnificent giant baobab but also the Malagasy people whose livelihoods depend on the preservation of their watersheds and forests. ,environment;pet; ,protected; ,2,1203,Grauerí¢ŒóŒ»s brush warbler; Grauerí¢ŒóŒ»s rush warbler; Grauerí¢ŒóŒ»s swamp-warbler,Bradypterus graueri,Grauerí¢ŒóŒ»s scrub-warbler (Bradypterus graueri),Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Sylviidae,Bradypterus (1),15 í¢ŒóŒñ 19 g (2),The montane swamps which the Grauer\xe2\x80\x99s scrub-warbler inhabits are not well protected and therefore habitat destruction and alteration poses the greatest threat to this species.  The largest population occurs in Rugezi swamp Rwanda (3); an area which is being degraded and encroached by agriculture (2).  Many smaller swamp sites particularly those near dense human settlements are also being drained for cultivation or pasture (2) (3).,Several of the swamps which Grauer\xe2\x80\x99s scrub-warblers inhabit are protected within national parks such Bwindi-Impenetrable Forest National Park Uganda and Kahuzi-Bi\xc3\xa9ga National Park Democratic Republic of Congo (2) (both World Heritage Sites) (5).  However the latter is not secure (3) having been badly affected by influxes of Rwandan refugees and rebel soldiers (6).  Rugezi swamp in Rwanda home to the largest population of Grauer\xe2\x80\x99s scrub-warblers urgently needs protection (3).  An action plan which outlines a strategy to improve the conservation status of the Grauer\xe2\x80\x99s scrub warbler was published in 2006.  Priority actions include determining the distribution population size and trends of the species and minimising the impact of human activities at key sites (4).

Lowland forests have been converted to banana plantations and cattle ranching thus producing habitat that is no longer suitable for this parrot (2). In Costa Rica the mountain almond is logged as a valuable tropical hardwood used for flooring and truck beds; this tree provides vital food and shelter for the great green macaw and its removal has had devastating consequences to the species (8). In addition this highly attractive parrot is under demand from the illegal pet trade and may be captured as a result (2). In both Ecuador and Costa Rica numbers of the great green macaw are worryingly low (2).,The great green macaw is protected by law and international trade is prohibited by its listing on Appendix I of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) (3). The DariBiosphere Reserve Panama and the Los KatNational Park in Colombia protect the species\xe2\x80\x99 strongholds (2). The Great Green Macaw Research and Conservation Project has been working in Costa Rica since 1994 to raise awareness and carry out research into this stunning species (6). This parrot is an important flagship species as it is such a habitat specialist; its protection will help to conserve other rainforest species. The proposed creation of the Maquenque National Park would protect vital remaining habitat (6) of this species.

The meat is highly prized and the cartilage underneath the <strong>plastron</strong> (known as 'calipee') is used in the production of turtle soup (8). In addition the green turtle is affected by a number of incidental threats including fisheries <strong>bycatch</strong> habitat degradation and disease. Building construction beach armouring and sand extraction are responsible for degradation of nesting habitat while light pollution at nesting beaches fatally attracts emerging green turtle hatchlings away from the sea. In the marine environment increased effluent over harvesting of algae and contamination from coastal development all negatively affect the quality of foraging habitat. In particular the degradation of marine habitats is implicated in the increase of fibropapillomas; fibrous tumours that can grow on almost any part of a turtles body impeding movement or sight and often leading to death (1).,The green turtle is protected by a raft of international legislation including the prohibition of international trade through its listing on Appendix I of CITES (1) (3). The result of numerous designations and agreements has been to notably reduce the intensity of direct impacts on the green turtle and in particular the rate at which eggs and adults are harvested. Nonetheless human impacts on the green turtle are still a significant concern with the lack of effective monitoring of fisheries responsible for considerable direct and indirect mortality while uncontrolled development continues to degrade the ecosystems that the green turtle depends on (1). ,environment;disease;pollution; ,cites;protected; ,3,2210,amapola; Mexican red-headed parrot; red-crowned Amazon; red-crowned parrot,Amazona viridigenalis,Green-cheeked Amazon (Amazona viridigenalis),Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Psittaciformes,Psittacidae,Amazona (1),Length: 33 cm (2)Wingspan: 40 cm (3),With a street value of between $900 and $1200 (3) the green-cheeked Amazon is massively exploited for the pet trade. As a beautiful bird which talks occasionally the green-cheeked Amazon is a popular pet and consequently thousands of chicks are taken from nests each year. Adding to this problem poachers often fell or damage nesting trees preventing their use in subsequent breeding seasons. With little else affecting their decline the green-cheeked Amazon is an endangered species as a result of supplying humans with exotic pets (5).,Whilst protected under international law (Appendix I of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species) and Mexican law (Nom 059) as well as occurring in two of Mexico\xe2\x80\x99s Biosphere Reserves poaching is still a massive problem.

Commercial poaching for skins has since declined due to effective protection measures put in place by Kenya and the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES). However in some areas Grevy\xe2\x80\x99s zebra is still hunted for subsistence meat and some ethnic groups use their fat for medicinal purposes such as treating tuberculosis. Habitat loss presents a major threat to the long-term survival of the species as grasslands and water sources have significantly declined due to unplanned grazing by livestock.

However as with many groupers the long life span slow growth late maturity and unusual life history of the Gulf grouper together with its small geographical range and its tendency to come together in large <strong>spawning</strong> aggregations all increase its vulnerability to overfishing (1) (6) (7) (8). The population of this once abundant fish is believed to have declined severely more than halving in the last 30 years (1) (6) and even more alarmingly may have declined by over 99 percent since the 1940s (1). In the Gulf of Mexico the sex ratio of the population is currently skewed with significantly fewer males than females. Sadly increased coastal development in the northern Gulf of California and greater investment in recreational fisheries look set to increase reef habitat destruction and intensify fishing pressure on the Gulf grouper in the future (1).,The Gulf grouper occurs in a few protected areas throughout its range including within the Alto Golfo Biosphere Reserve although enforcement in this area is lacking (1).

The species occurs in a number of state owned forests; however the management of these areas does not necessarily take into consideration the management of this <strong>subterranean</strong> mammal. The potential for some of these forests to be sold to private ownership and commercial forestry operations also means that this species could become even more threatened (1) (9).

By the middle of the 1980s just 4.7 percent of the original forest cover remained (4). Hunting disturbance by humans and trade are also believed to have played a part in the decline (4). Deforestation continued illegally in Thailand throughout the 1990s and several Gurney\xe2\x80\x99s pitta <strong>territories</strong> were destroyed as a result (4).,A wildlife sanctuary was established in 1993 but much of the habitat of Gurney's pitta was excluded. In 1990 the Khao Nor Chuchi Lowland Forest project was established this is a socio-economic community-level conservation and development project the aims of which are diverse. Achievements include the creation of more wildlife friendly areas amongst a mosaic of cultivation tree planting supporting forest protection workers and promoting sustainable agriculture (4). However difficulties have plagued the project. It is clear that unless drastic action is taken and the crucial 30 kilometre squared area of suitable habitat is completely protected soon this species will become extinct (4). ,hunting; ,protected; ,1,1226,Neohylomys hainanensis,Hylomys hainanensis,Hainan gymnure (Hylomys hainanensis),Animalia,Chordata,Mammalia,Erinaceomorpha,Erinaceidae,Hylomys (1),50 í¢ŒóŒñ 69 g (2),The preferred habitat of the Hainan gymnure evergreen forest is under considerable pressure from clearance for timber and the expansion of agriculture (2).,Although the Hainan gymnure is poorly known the rate of habitat loss on Hainan Island is great enough to raise serious concern for this species\xe2\x80\x99 survival. It has therefore been recommended by the <strong>IUCN/SSC</strong> Insectivore Tree Shrew and Elephant Shrew Specialist Group that its precise distribution and status needs to be determined (2).

A single otter pelt may fetch up to $200 an attractive reward to many hunters who often live in economically poor areas and the hairy-nosed otter may also be hunted for its meat with hunting still particularly rampant in Tonle Sap Lake and the Mekong Delta (5) (10). As a result of this hunting otter populations across Southeast Asia have undergone substantial declines (1) (14).,The hairy-nosed otter is protected by law in all of its range states and is also listed on Appendix II of the Convention on the International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) which should ensure that international trade is monitored (1) (4). Its habitat is also protected in some areas by the RAMSAR Convention and the Convention on Biological Diversity and it is found in a number of protected areas (1) (10). In reality however this species has received little protection mainly because of a lack of law enforcement at the local level and hunting and habitat loss has continued to threaten this Endangered species (3) (10). In addition to improved law enforcement this species would also benefit from further studies into its ecology and further surveys in areas which could potentially support populations such as the Irrawaddy Delta as information on its distribution is limited while there is no such information on its population (3) (6).\xa0 \xa0 ,loss;hunting;disease;pollution; ,cites;protected; ,4,2228,Koloa maoli,Anas wyvilliana,Hawaiian duck (Anas wyvilliana),Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Anseriformes,Anatidae,Anas (1),461 - 605 g (3),By the mid 20th century the combined impacts of predation by non-native animals habitat loss for agriculture and urban development and over-hunting decimated the once abundant Hawaiian duck to around 530 individuals (2). Fortunately with protection and prohibition of hunting the population recovered to around 2000 at the beginning of this century (2) (5) (6). However today a much more subtle dynamic presents the greatest threat to the species survival. Non-native mallards were first introduced to Hawaii for ornamental ponds and farming in the 1800s and in the 1950s and 1960s hundreds were imported to stock hunting areas. Since then cross-breeding between the two closely related species has had a dramatic influence on the number of pure Hawaiian ducks particularly on Oahu and Maui. Furthermore it is now suspected that even the core populations on Kauai and Niihau contain hybrids (2) (5). In addition to <strong>hybridisation</strong> several other more conspicuous threats continue to have an impact on this species including predation by introduced mammals habitat loss wetland modification by alien plants and human disturbance (2).,The establishment of several State and Federal wildlife sanctuaries in conjunction with legal protection under endangered species laws and a program of re-introductions of captive bred birds was instrumental in the recovery of the Hawaiian duck population during the latter half of the 20th century (2) (4) (6). In the late 1980s a ban was placed on the importation of mallards except for research and exhibition and was followed in 2002 by the implementation of restrictive import regulations on all birds shipped to the islands to protect the public from West Nile Virus (2) (5). Even so the mallard continues to reproduce on the islands and is still sold commercially (5). The priority therefore is to control populations of mallards and <strong>hybrids</strong> to prevent irreversible genetic swamping of the Hawaiian duck populations (2). This is to be achieved via a three-pronged approach involving public outreach humane removal of feral mallards and hybrids and stronger regulatory controls on non-native potentially harmful ducks (4). Already underway is an outreach and communications plan and field key for differentiating pure birds from <strong>hybrids</strong> (4) (5). ,loss;hunting; , ,2,0229,New Zealand dolphin; white-headed dolphin,Cephalorhynchus hectori,Hector's dolphin (Cephalorhynchus hectori),Animalia,Chordata,Mammalia,Cetartiodactyla,Delphinidae,Cephalorhynchus (1),40 - 60 kg (2),Currently the major threat to the survival of this species is <strong>bycatch</strong> by commercial and recreational fishers particularly entanglements in gillnets which is reported to occur throughout the range (1) (6) (9). Due to the coastal habitat of Hector's dolphin the species is vulnerable to a large number of other threats such as pollution vessel traffic and habitat modification as well as fisheries <strong>bycatch</strong> (1).,The New Zealand Marine Mammals Protection Act has made the deliberate killing or injury of marine mammals illegal (1). Under this act the Department of Conservation designated the Banks Peninsula Marine Mammal Sanctuary in 1988 effectively prohibiting commercial gillnetting and restricting recreational gillnetting. A second protected area was designated on the west coast of the North Island in 2003. These were surpassed by new Ministry of Fisheries regulations in 2008 which ban gillnetting to four nautical miles off the majority of the South Island\xe2\x80\x99s east and south coasts regulate gillnetting on the South Island\xe2\x80\x99s west coast to two nautical miles (3.7 kilometres) offshore and extend the gillnet ban on the North Island\xe2\x80\x99s west coast to seven nautical miles (13 kilometres) offshore.

Although it is no longer in such demand due to the availability of cheaper synthetics it is still found in as many as 400 Chinese and Korean medicines and may sell for as much as $45000 per kilogram making it one of the most valuable animal-derived products in the world (4) (10). As a result of its high value and the poor economic state of many communities within its range hunting of the Himalayan musk deer has been unsustainable (1) (11). Animals are indiscriminately caught using snares and although only adult males produce musk both females and juveniles are also caught with between three and five deer killed per harvested musk pod. In some regions the Himalayan musk deer may also be hunted for its meat while its habitat is threatened by encroaching pastoral farming (1) (11). \xa0,The Himalayan musk deer is protected by law in Bhutan Nepal and India. In China hunting may be permitted in some areas although a license is required. This Endangered species is also found in a number of protected areas; however the uneven enforcement of legislation across its range has meant there has been little impact on preventing the rampant trade in the species (11).

This decline has been highest in the eastern parts of its range where it is suspected to have undergone at least a 90 percent decrease. The hog deer is now one of the most threatened large mammals in Indochina and is believed to be extinct in Laos Vietnam Thailand and most of Cambodia. Furthermore it is believed extinct in China and most of Bangladesh. In India and Nepal outside of protected areas few viable populations remain and severe hunting pressure exists (1).,A rare and vulnerable species the hog deer is in drastic need of critical conservation measures. Recognising this every country within the species\xe2\x80\x99 range has afforded the hog deer full protection from hunting (1). The relict Indochinese population in Kratie Cambodia has received extra protection and the WWF Greater Mekong Programme supports a number of rangers that patrol the area deterring hunters. WWF has also begun community education and ecotourism programmes that aim to highlight the plight of this vulnerable population (5) (10). Furthermore Global Wildlife Conservation is developing plans to protect the newly discovered population in Botum-Sakor National Park southwest Cambodia although the total population size is unknown (6). The hog deer is also found in a number of protected areas including some of the most secure reserves in the world such as the Corbett Tiger Reserve in India. It has also indirectly benefited from the conservation of the Indian rhinoceros (<em>Rhinoceros unicornis</em>) with which it co-exists in wet grasslands.

The tree is sought after for both its high quality timber and medicinal resin which are of commercial value and have been traded for several centuries (1) (4) This has led to intense logging making it extremely rare across its entire range (1) and close to local extinction in 11 countries (8). The holywood lignum vitae was previously found in El Salvador but has now gone regionally extinct there (1) (4). Regeneration of the holywood lignum vitae is being encouraged but due to the slow growth rate of this species progress is slow (1).,The holywood lignum vitae is included on the convention on the\xa0Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) Appendix II regulates its international trade (2). There has been recent consideration of it being re-categorised to CITES Appendix I making international trade of wild trees illegal (4). This species is also found in some protected areas.

Unfortunately dry thorn-forests are the most endangered ecosystem in Honduras and have been reduced by a drastic 90 percent. Vast areas of thorn-forest have been converted to rice and pineapple plantations and cattle pastures while urbanisation and agriculture continue to encroach upon the Honduran emerald\xe2\x80\x99s habitat\xa0 (5) (6). In the R\xc3\xado Agu\xc3\xa1n valley only 84 square kilometres of suitable Honduran emerald habitat remains while in the Agalta valley there is less than one square kilometre. Furthermore much of the remaining habitat is privately owned for cattle grazing and receives no form of protection. Consequently the population of the Honduran emerald is now critically small and it is considered the rarest bird in Central America and one of the most endangered birds in the world (4) (5) (8) (9).\xa0,In Honduras a small poor country with a rapidly growing economy conservation is a major challenge (6). However the American Bird Conservancy is working to ensure the rare Honduran emerald is afforded increased protection through the acquisition of 30 square kilometres of suitable habitat (4) (5). The Fundaci\xc3\xb3n Pico Bonito a Honduran conservation organisation has also successfully secured funding from the World Bank to invest in habitat protection and to mitigate the effects of planned road constructions (6).

Populations of Hoogstraal\xe2\x80\x99s cat snake are in decline in Egypt because its habitat is being destroyed and the habitat quality is decreasing.

Other threats include predation by pumas foxes and domestic dogs habitat destruction fires and livestock ranching.  Locally over-grazing construction and recreational activities may prove detrimental to the huemul (2) (3). In addition large areas of forest have been harvested and replaced by agriculture and exotic tree forestry operations (2) resulting in huemul populations becoming isolated and therefore more vulnerable to local extinction (6).,An estimated 1000 to 2000 individuals survive today (2006) and this number is thought to be declining (3) (7).

Its life history characteristics make this species extremely vulnerable to exploitation and the population can only sustain light levels of fishing (4). Traditionally the flesh of this fish has been highly prized and more recently this species has become one of the most highly sought species of the Live Reef Food Fish Trade (LRFFT) a luxury food industry that has undergone an increase in popularity in many eastern Asian countries (4). Humphead wrasse can fetch up to US $100 per kilogram at retail in Hong Kong (4) and as their numbers dwindle the rarity of the species is likely to increase the price (4). Cyanide is typically used to catch fish for this trade because live fish are difficult to take any other way; a practice that devastates coral reefs (4).,Little is known of the biology and distribution of the humphead wrasse and more data are urgently needed to understand the scale of the threats faced by current populations and to implement effective conservation programmes (4). The World Conservation Union's (IUCN) Groupers and Wrasses Specialist Group is working to collect this all-important data and to raise awareness of the issues involved throughout the region (4). The species is partially protected in areas of Australia the Philippines the Maldives and Palau and was proposed for inclusion in Appendix II of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) in November 2002 (4).

Hunting pressure is high in many of the remaining forested areas with Huon tree kangaroos hunted primarily by natives of Papua New Guinea for their succulent meat. Although traditionally hunted by people with dingoes which had relatively little impact on populations the introduction of guns to the island has dramatically increased the numbers that can be caught and severely jeopardised the future of this species (2).,The main focus of conservation efforts for this species has been on captive-breeding programmes with individuals held at a number of zoos worldwide (2). Woodland Park Zoo in Seattle is a leader in captive breeding and reproduction research on the Huon tree kangaroo being the first to recognize the importance of isolating females after mating to reduce stress on the mother and increase infant survival rates (5). A Species Survival Plan has also been developed by international zoos for this species which focuses on field studies and preserving the species\xe2\x80\x99 natural habitat whilst at the same time maintaining and studying a large captive population and stressing the need for education on the detrimental effects of forest destruction and hunting (3).

Subsistence hunting was prevalent throughout the mid to late 1940s and the species continued to be hunted for the pet trade into the 1980s (8). Thankfully strict law enforcement a comprehensive education and awareness campaign and national pride have all but eliminated threats from poaching since the early 1990\xe2\x80\x99s (2) (7). Despite an increase in numbers the population remains low with estimates of between 150 and 250 adults remaining (4) (8) and the species is therefore still classified as Endangered by the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species (1). Habitat loss still poses a serious threat however and as lowland forests are increasingly cleared the imperial Amazon may face competition for nest sites with the related species <i>Amazonia arausiaca</i> (2).,The imperial Amazon has benefited from Dominica\xe2\x80\x99s long history of forest conservation and more recently from intensive governmental and non-governmental efforts to protect its habitat and make local citizens aware of its needs (8). Indeed it is as a result of a dedicated conservation programme targeted at the imperial Amazon spearheaded by the partnership between Dominica\xe2\x80\x99s Forestry Wildlife and Parks Division and the Rare Species Conservatory Foundation (RSCF) (8) that numbers of this species have slowly increased. To date this partnership has significantly aided this endangered parrot through integrating extensive protected-area and law enforcement legislation with staff training education and public awareness and research on both captive and wild populations (8) (6). A major result of this programme of conservation has been the creation of the Morne Diablotin National Park in the known nesting area for the species (5) first initiated in 1997 (8). An <i>in situ</i> captive programme has long been in place to research and rehabilitate the birds and a pair of imperial Amazons that has resided at the Parrot Conservation and Research Centre (Forestry Wildlife and Parks Headquarters in Roseau) since 2000 laid their first clutch of infertile eggs in April 2006 revealing important information about their reproductive biology (7).

During <strong>hibernation</strong> the Indiana bat is vulnerable to human disturbance which can cause direct mortality or cause them to rouse and deplete their important energy reserves.  Disturbance can be in the form of researchers vandalism and the commercialization of caves allowing tourists to visit caves.  Modifications to mines and caves such as the construction of gates to restrict human access alter airflow temperature and humidity to which the Indiana bat is very sensitive; or gates may not allow sufficient flight space for the bats and thus block them from a critical <strong>hibernation</strong> site (2) (3).  As Indiana bats <strong>hibernate</strong> in very large numbers in only a few caves this makes them particularly vulnerable to disturbance and natural disasters as a large proportion of the total population can be affected by a single event (3).,As well as being classified as Endangered on the IUCN Red List 2007 (1) the Indiana bat is also listed as Endangered under the Endangered Species Act of 1973.  As an outcome of this the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service has drawn up a recovery plan with the goal of improving the status of the Indiana bat so that it can be removed from the Endangered Species List (3).  To reach the goal a number of actions are required; conserving and managing the hibernacula and the summer habitat conducting further essential research and implementing a public information and outreach program.  Dependent on funding and the implementation of conservation actions it has been estimated that the species can fully recover by the year 2027 (3).  At present the primary conservation effort has been to control human access of caves by erecting properly designed gates that keep people from disturbing hibernating bats while maintaining temperature humidity and allowing access for bats (3). ,loss; ,endangered species act; ,1,1245,Indri í€Œó Queue Courte,Indri indri,Indri (Indri indri),Animalia,Chordata,Mammalia,Primates,Indriidae,Indri (1),6 í¢ŒóŒñ 9.5 kg (2),The indri is one of the most endangered species of lemur on Madagascar and one of the most threatened primates in the world (4). They live by the coast where forests have become so fragmented that they are almost too small to sustain viable populations (6). The main threat is slash-and-burn agriculture a practice that continues even in protected areas (7). Forests are also cut down for fuel and timber as human populations increase (5). Hunting of the indri is a taboo in many areas on the island so this species does not suffer as much as other lemurs from trapping although sometimes it is killed for food (5) (7). Despite this the indri is a seriously endangered species and will almost certainly face extinction in the next 100 years if conservation efforts do not succeed (4).,The indri has never been bred successfully in captivity (7). Protection of their natural habitat is therefore imperative to ensure that they are not lost forever (6) (7). Unfortunately there is no easy answer to Madagascar\xe2\x80\x99s conservation problems. Despite the indri being endangered Madagascar\xe2\x80\x99s increasing human population needs space and resources and inevitably this erodes natural habitats (4). This problem is made worse because Madagascar is an island; this therefore limits the area that men and wildlife can expand into (6). Conservation plans have designated some areas of the island to be protected from deforestation but there is evidence that forest clearing continues inside the parks (5) (7). It would be sad indeed to see the indri populations once so prevalent dwindle away to nothing (6). ,hunting; ,protected; ,1,1246,Saramugo,Anaecypris hispanica,Jarabugo (Anaecypris hispanica),Animalia,Chordata,Actinopterygii,Cypriniformes,Cyprinidae,Anaecypris (1),Length: up to 7 cm (2),Once a relatively abundant fish in the Guadiana basin the jarabugo now has a fragmented distribution and has undergone a catastrophic decline in numbers (9). Between 1996 and 2006 this species\xe2\x80\x99 population decreased by over 50 percent a decrease that is ongoing despite the efforts of current conservation programs (1).,Extinction of the jarabugo seems inevitable unless there is a sustained conservation effort for this species (2). Conventional conservation strategies focusing around active breeding programmes or the transfer of individuals from one location to another are not viable because this small fish species is extremely sensitive to handling (9). ,loss;pollution; , ,2,0247,moloch; silvery gibbon,Hylobates moloch,Javan gibbon (Hylobates moloch),Animalia,Chordata,Mammalia,Primates,Hylobatidae,Hylobates (1),5.9 kg (4),The\xa0Javan gibbon has undergone a dramatic population decline principally as a result of habitat destruction (6) and also from the trapping of juveniles for the pet trade (2). The native forests of Java have been cleared for logging agriculture and development and the species has declined to fewer than 1000 individuals over the last 25 years (4). This gibbon appears to be on the very brink of extinction with only a handful of isolated viable populations remaining (6).,In light of the status of this species in the wild a Javan gibbon rescue and rehabilitation workshop was conducted in 1997 hosted by Conservation International and the University of Indonesia (2). It was agreed that a rescue and rehabilitation centre was needed and education programmes were proposed (5). Currently the only viable protected population is found within the Gunung Halimun National Park; if this attractive primate is to survive it is vital that protection both within the park and in other areas is increased (6). ,pet; ,protected; ,1,1248,Aguila-azor de Java,Spizaetus bartelsi,Javan hawk-eagle (Spizaetus bartelsi),Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Falconiformes,Accipitridae,Spizaetus (1),Length: 60 cm (2),Habitat loss caused the initial decline of this bird as the increasing human population of Java relies heavily on the natural resources of their island particularly its forests. Conversion to agriculture urban development and uncontrolled fire even in protected areas resulted in a sharp decline that prompted the Indonesian government to promote the Javan hawk-eagle to the status of \xe2\x80\x98national bird\xe2\x80\x99. However this move rebounded as trade in the species multiplied in response to its new significance and consequential desirability (2).,The range and population of this species have been surveyed revealing its presence in Gunung Haliman Gunung Gede-Pangrango and Meru Betiri National Parks. However despite the strict legislation protecting the eagle from hunting and trading it faces serious problems through ineffective enforcement of the law. An action plan has been compiled and conservation awareness programmes have begun. The action plan suggests that thorough ecological studies are performed to allow the implementation of management plans. Nest-guarding is being seriously considered as an option to enforce legislation protecting this beautiful species (2). ,loss; , ,1,0249,Blue-tailed trogon,Apalharpactes reinwardtii,Javan trogon (Apalharpactes reinwardtii),Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Trogoniformes,Trogonidae,Apalharpactes (1),Average head-body length: 34 cm (2),With only five percent of original forest cover remaining on Java the Javan trogon is primarily threatened by the loss degradation and fragmentation of its forest habitat (4) (6). Java is the most densely inhabited Indonesian island and urbanisation and agriculture continues to encroach upon the island\xe2\x80\x99s forests (7). However the montane forests that remain on Java are now relatively stable in their limited extent (8).,With a small population and an extremely restricted range the survival of the Javan trogon may be dependant upon the successful implementation of conservation measures (1). Thankfully this rare species has been afforded some protection in the Gunung Gede-Pangrango and Gunung Halimun National Parks with the latter supporting the largest remaining population (4). The Javan trogon will also benefit from further surveys aiming to determine the full extent of the species\xe2\x80\x99 range and the establishment of several new protected areas (4) (7). ,loss;fragmentation; ,protected; ,2,1250,Cí€Œ©phalophe De Jentink,Cephalophus jentinki,Jentinkí¢ŒóŒ»s duiker (Cephalophus jentinki),Animalia,Chordata,Mammalia,Cetartiodactyla,Bovidae,Cephalophus (1),55 í¢ŒóŒñ 80 kg (2),Much of the natural forest within the range of the Jentink\xe2\x80\x99s duiker has been lost to human activities or modified by human disturbance; the area of <strong>primary forest</strong> in Sierra Leone is now just six percent of the original forest cover (9).  The remaining forest in C\xc3\xb4te d'Ivoire and Sierra Leone is highly fragmented and remains under pressure as humans seek to use more forest for farmland timber fuelwood and mineral resources (9).,Jentink\xe2\x80\x99s duiker is listed on Appendix I of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) meaning that international trade in this species is only allowed in exceptional circumstances (3).  However this does little to control the threat of hunting within its range countries and whilst in some areas of its distribution hunting of wild animals is now prohibited (2) such a ban is impractical and cannot be enforced (9).  Unlike Sierra Leone and C\xc3\xb4te d'Ivoire Liberia still holds some large areas of forest with the largest stands being in protected areas and forest reserves (9).  The continued protection of these areas appears to be essential to the continued survival of Jentink\xe2\x80\x99s duiker along with efforts to educate the public about the plight of duikers and the importance of sustainable hunting (10). ,loss;hunting; ,cites;protected; ,2,2251,Bufo gemmifer; Cranopsis gemmifer; Ollotis gemmifer,Incilius gemmifer,Jeweled toad (Incilius gemmifer),Animalia,Chordata,Amphibia,Anura,Bufonidae,Incilius (1),Snout-vent length: up to 8 cm (2),The main threat to the jeweled toad is habitat loss due to the spread of agriculture the expansion of plantations and wood extraction.

Other short-term threats include the urbanisation of the coastal plain and the construction of a road BR 101 which may lead to further fragmentation of the population. Possible sea-level rise also poses a potential long-term threat to Kaempfer\xe2\x80\x99s tody-tyrant (2).,Kaempfer\xe2\x80\x99s tody-tyrant is currently protected by Brazilian law (2) (6) as are two of the areas it can be found in Paran\xc3\xa1 and Santa Catarina (3). Further conservation measures for this species should include slowing the rate of deforestation and proper and regular surveys need to be conducted as current information on Kaempfer\xe2\x80\x99s tody-tyrant is only based on casual observations (3). ,fragmentation; ,protected; ,1,1253,Caatinga woodpecker; Piaui woodpecker,Celeus obrieni,Kaempferí¢ŒóŒ»s woodpecker (Celeus obrieni),Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Piciformes,Picidae,Celeus (1),Head-body length: 26 í¢ŒóŒñ 28 cm (2),The greatest threat to Kaempfer\xe2\x80\x99s woodpecker is the loss of its <em><strong>Cerrado</strong></em> habitat to infrastructure development and agriculture (2) (3) (7). Around three million hectares of <em><strong>Cerrado</strong></em> is destroyed each year within the region with road construction and the expansion of soya crop cultivation the primary agents. The species\xe2\x80\x99 habitat is also frequently degraded by artificial fires for cattle ranching (2). As a result of such severe threats Kaempfer\xe2\x80\x99s woodpecker is suspected to have a highly patchy distribution and a small population size currently estimated at no more than 250 mature individuals (2) (3).\xa0,As the species\xe2\x80\x99 habitat is still relatively prevalent and due to probable inconspicuous habits something that is characteristic of <em>Celeus</em> woodpeckers Kaempfers\xe2\x80\x99s woodpecker may be more numerous than currently thought.

Forests have been cleared for timber and to make way for agriculture and these birds have also traditionally been hunted for their meat. Kagus are island birds that have evolved in isolation and in the absence of terrestrial predators; when Europeans first arrived on New Caledonia they bought with them rats cats and dogs and these flightless birds represented easy prey (4). Today dogs may represent the most important threat to the survival of this species; in 1993 dogs killed 17 out of 21 radio-collared birds within the reserve of Pic Nigua alone (2).,Kagus are protected within the Riviere Bleue and dogs are controlled in this area (2). They are also found within the Reserve Speciale de Faune et de Flore de la Novdela where there is no dog control in place (2). In 1992 Birdlife International initiated a Recovery Programme for this species. A captive breeding programme run by the Southern Province and the Societe Caledonienne d'Ornithologie has been in place since 1978 (4) and juveniles have been released into the Riviere Bleue Park with some success (4).

Reasons for this marked decline include extensive habitat losses due to forest clearing pressures from hunting predators and introduced competitors (4).,To tackle the threats facing the kaka predator and pest control surveys are being carried out in several large areas and near nesting sites (2). Populations are also being monitored with juveniles being radio tracked to identify their movements habitat and food requirements and survival rates (4). In 1996 - 1997 a small population of 14 juveniles were successfully introduced into a new area Mt Bruce Reserve North Island (4).

Due to its habitat requirements the kaka-beak was probably never a common plant and may owe its survival partly to the old-time Maori who cultivated it in their villages (6).   Today a large secure cultivated population exists although it appears to contain very limited genetic diversity (7).,Most of the 200 remaining wild specimens occur within the boundaries of the Te Urewera National Park and the extensive cultivated populations do provide potential for reintroductions.

This turtle is collected for local consumption and for the national and international food and pet trade and is exploited on such a large-scale it is highly unlikely to be sustainable. For example between 1994 and 1999 6560 keeled box turtles were legally exported from Vietnam. This major threat is compounded by habitat loss and degradation due to deforestation and shifting cultivation (7).,Due to the unsustainable trade in this species the keeled box turtle was listed in 2003 on Appendix II of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) and thus trade should now be strictly controlled and monitored (3).

The unique structure of the saw makes all sawfish extremely vulnerable to entanglement and capture in a range of fishing gear both in targeted fisheries and as accidental <strong>bycatch</strong>. Although most landings are accidental the knifetooth sawfish is highly valued for its meat fins liver oil and skin and when caught is usually retained. The saw is also highly valued both as a curio and for use in traditional Chinese medicine (1) (2) (4) (6) (12). An increasing demand for live specimens for public aquaria may be putting further pressure on this species (1) (6) (11).,In 2007 the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) listed the knifetooth sawfish on Appendix I meaning that international trade in the species is now banned (3). The knifetooth sawfish is legally protected in India (1) (6) but little other effective legislation appears to exist for the species elsewhere (4). In Australia monitoring research and recovery plans have been recommended for all sawfish (6) (11) (12) but the knifetooth sawfish has yet to be listed there under the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act (EPBC) 1999 (1) (11). Recent advances in obtaining DNA samples from dry sawfish rostra (13) together with studies into DNA \xe2\x80\x98barcoding\xe2\x80\x99 from confiscated fins (14) may help fishing authorities to gather essential data on the illegal fishing of sawfish and other sharks and rays hopefully assisting in the management and conservation of this unique and Endangered fish. ,loss;fishing;environment; ,cites;protected; ,3,2262,Indigo macaw,Anodorhynchus leari,Lear's macaw (Anodorhynchus leari),Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Psittaciformes,Psittacidae,Anodorhynchus (1),Length: 74 cm (2),Lear's macaw is thought to be a naturally rare species (4) and population numbers were low when it was discovered in 1978. The major threat to this species comes from the illegal wildlife trade. Collectors will pay high prices for such rare and beautiful birds and a breeding pair is thought to be worth as much as \xc2\xa350000 on the black market (4). The population of Lear's macaws is also highly influenced by the availability of their principal food source the licuri palm numbers of which have recently been vastly reduced due to livestock-grazing (5). A major fire could now wipe the whole palm population out (5) leaving this parrot fatally vulnerable.,Although protected by the Brazilian government and listed on Appendix I of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) effectively banning international trade in the species the Lear's macaw remains critically at danger from illegal trade (5). Recent infiltration of poaching rings and guarding of roosting sites may be finally slowing the decline in this species and there are plans to grow and fence 50000 licuri palm seedlings (5). A recent population survey has reported an encouraging increase in Lear's macaw numbers in the wild; in the municipalities of Canudos and Jeremoabo the population now stands at around 455 individuals (6). The steady increase in the population has led to the IUCN downgrading the Lear\xe2\x80\x99s macaw from Critically Endangered to Endangered in 2009 although continued conservation measures and repeated monitoring of the population remain high priorities to ensure the continued protection of this species (8). , ,cites;protected; ,0,2263,Iguane des Petites Antilles,Iguana delicatissima,Lesser Antillean iguana (Iguana delicatissima),Animalia,Chordata,Reptilia,Squamata,Iguanidae,Iguana (1),Male snout to vent length: 43 cm (2)Female snout to vent length: 39 cm (2)Male weight: 3.5 kg (2)Female weight: 2.6 kg (2),In the past the Lesser Antillean iguana has been brought to near or total local extinction by clearance of suitable habitat for agriculture on St. Kitts Nevis Basse Terre and St. Eustatius.

In time other familiar threats became increasingly more significant including habitat loss through agricultural land conversion and over-grazing of livestock and the rapid encroachment of non-native vegetation (2) (6). In the 1980s the world population of lesser florican declined by 60 percent to just over 1600 birds but fortunately rebounded by the mid 1990s to a moderately less alarming 2200. These recent fluctuations have been found to closely match breeding season rainfall patterns and reveal the vulnerability of the species to extinction in the event of a severe drought. Worryingly it is anticipated that the pressure on remaining grassland habitat is set to continue in the future and as result the rate of decline in the lesser florican population will increase (2).,Despite the prohibition of hunting of lesser floricans throughout India and inclusion on Appendix II of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) and under Schedule 1 of the Wildlife (Protection) Act 1972 the species\xe2\x80\x99 long-term survival remains uncertain because of the continued threat of rapid habitat loss coupled with high vulnerability to drought (2) (3) (6). In an effort to preserve breeding habitat two lesser florican sanctuaries Sailana and Sardarpur in Madhya Pradesh were established in 1983 (2) (7) (8). However the value of these sanctuaries is limited by the movement of monsoonal conditions which determine which areas lesser floricans choose to breed. If weather conditions are unfavourable in any given year only a small number of floricans may actually breed within the protective bounds of the sanctuaries (8). In recent years a proposal known as \xe2\x80\x98Project Bustards\xe2\x80\x99 has been put to the Indian government to ensure the survival of India\xe2\x80\x99s four species of bustard all of which are endangered (2) (8). This broadly includes: strictly protecting bustard habitat involving local communities in conservation establishing regional cooperation amongst different states and increasing scientific research into bustard ecology. An ambitious proposal specific to the lesser florican is to develop a network of fodder-producing grasslands throughout its range to afford local communities fodder security whilst also providing optimal breeding habitat for the lesser florican during the monsoon (8). Unfortunately until \xe2\x80\x98Project Bustard\xe2\x80\x99 receives government approval these vitally important proposals remain on paper and the lesser florican leaps ever closer to extinction. ,loss;hunting; ,cites; ,2,1266,Lí€Œ©zard De Lilford; Lí€Œ©zard Des Balí€Œ©ares,Podarcis lilfordi,Lilford's wall lizard (Podarcis lilfordi),Animalia,Chordata,Reptilia,Squamata,Lacertidae,Podarcis (1),Adult snout-vent length: 5 - 7 cm (2) (3)Adult weight: 4.2 - 9.5 g (2),The total population of Lilford's wall lizard is comprised of several small isolated and fragmented populations thus making this species extremely vulnerable to localised extinctions (1).

Only 1% of the original habitat remains today due to widespread deforestation for timber agriculture and development (4). This species persists in isolated pockets of remaining forest which can lead to <strong>inbreeding depression</strong> thus further threatening their precarious status (5). Additional threats come from hunting; they may be persecuted as crop pests and are often mistaken for Nilgiri langurs (<i>Semnopithecus johnii</i>) whose meat is erroneously believed to have medicinal properties (2) (4).,This species is one of the most endangered macaques in the world (4).

One recommendation was the establishment of a captive breeding programme (9) which was quickly initiated.  In 1992 five male and one female Livingstone\xe2\x80\x99s flying foxes were imported to the Jersey Wildlife Preservation Trust (now the Durrell Wildlife Conservation Trust).  This captive population increased in 1993 with the addition of five more males and another female and five further females were added in 1995 (10).  The programme has apparently been successful with (as of 2002) 42 individuals existing in captivity in three colonies at Jersey and Bristol zoos (11).  In 2007 a new comprehensive plan called the <i>Conservation Action Plan for Livingstone\xe2\x80\x99s Flying Fox</i> was developed for the species and its habitat.  This plan identified a conservation strategy focusing on actions such as habitat protection forest management environmental education population monitoring captive breeding and ecological research.  Initial steps are now underway to implement this plan (12). , ,captive breeding; ,0,1271,Caouanne; Tortue Caouanne,Caretta caretta,Loggerhead turtle (Caretta caretta),Animalia,Chordata,Reptilia,Testudines,Cheloniidae,Caretta (1),Adults: 75 - 160 kg (2)Record weight: 227+ kg (2)Length: 80 - 100 cm (2)Record length: 122+ cm (2),Long-distance migration makes loggerheads particularly vulnerable to accidental capture by commercial fisheries (<strong>bycatch</strong>) and turtles can become caught in shrimp trawler nets or entangled in longlines leading to mortal injuries or death by drowning (7).

Changes in forestry management with the increasing use of pesticides and native tree canopy species being replaced with exotics has resulted in forest fragmentation and gaps in the canopy (1) (3). Coffee plantations have also been felled and replaced with ginger cultivation (3). Consequently many populations of the long-tailed climbing mouse have been left isolated greatly increasing the species extinction risk (1).,There are currently no conservation measures in place for the long-tailed climbing mouse and it is not known to occur in any protected areas. However further surveys in the Brahmagiri and Pushpagiri Wildlife Sanctuaries may find additional populations. This Endangered species will also benefit from further studies into its distribution ecology and population status (1). ,loss;fragmentation; ,protected; ,2,1274,Bí€Œ_ho Pequeí€Œ±o de Bigotes Alargados; Lechucita Bigotona Mochuelo Peludo,Xenoglaux loweryi,Long-whiskered owlet (Xenoglaux loweryi),Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Strigiformes,Strigidae,Xenoaglaux (1),Length: 13 í¢ŒóŒñ 14 cm (2),The primary threat to the long-whiskered owlet is the loss of its humid forest habitat (10). The tropical Andes including the owlet\xe2\x80\x99s range are classified as a biodiversity hotspot but it is estimated that only 25 percent of the original habitat remains in this area (11). Although some areas of <strong>montane forest</strong> in north-east Peru remain relatively pristine (12) deforestation is accelerating (10).,The main conservation measures aimed at or affecting the long-whiskered owlet involve the protection of its habitat. Until recently the owlet\xe2\x80\x99s habitat was completely unprotected (6); although the species occurred near to the Alto Mayo Protected Forest in San Mart\xc3\xadn (2) protection was only partial (14) and had little effect on the rate of deforestation (2). ,loss;poaching; ,protected; ,2,1275,Lord Howe rail,Gallirallus sylvestris,Lord Howe Island woodhen (Gallirallus sylvestris),Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Gruiformes,Rallidae,Gallirallus (1),Length: 46 cm (2),During the 19th Century the population of Lord Howe woodhen was decimated by the introduction of predators and by habitat disturbance caused by settlers arriving on the island (4). Recent control measures mean that feral animals are not such a threat today although the introduction of the Australian masked-owl (<i>Tyto novaehollandiae castaneothorax</i>) in an effort to control rat numbers in the 1920s is thought to have been responsible for a major decline in one population in 1989 (5). As it is restricted to a single island the woodhen remains highly vulnerable to natural catastrophes or the accidental introduction of further non-native predators or disease (5).,In the mid-1970s the population of Lord Howe woodhen teetered on the brink of extinction as the population reached a new low of less than 30 individuals (4). Since that time conservation efforts such as the removal of wild pigs and the release of captive-bred birds have helped this species to slowly recover. The population is now estimated at 130 birds (2002) and the local community is very involved with conservation efforts which can minimise the threat of predation and disturbance by pet dogs (5). The trends in population numbers continue to be monitored but at this time the future looks encouraging for the Lord Howe woodhen. ,disease; , ,1,0276,Louisiana pinesnake,Pituophis ruthveni,Louisiana pine snake (Pituophis ruthveni),Animalia,Chordata,Reptilia,Squamata,Colubridae,Pituophis (1),Total length: up to 179 cm (2),The Louisiana pine snake\xe2\x80\x99s natural habitat is one of the most threatened ecosystems in the United States (12).

The major threats are hunting and habitat loss which is occurring in Sulawesi due to the draining of marshland agricultural development and logging (1). Anoas are hunted for their desirable meat which is sold in local markets. In addition the skull and the horns are made into trophies souvenirs and used in traditional medicine (4). ,Sulawesi\xe2\x80\x99s forests have the highest level of mammal <strong>endemism</strong> in Asia and there are several conservation programmes underway on the island (7).

Wetland habitats in Madagascar have been lost to conversion to rice cultivation and degraded by siltation as a result of deforestation in the surrounding land (4).  The collection of the heron\xe2\x80\x99s eggs and the capture of nestlings by local people for food is also impacting heron populations (2) (4) and these damaging activities are only expected to increase as the human population in western Madagascar continues to rise (4).  The depletion of the heron\xe2\x80\x99s prey by local fisheries is also a potential threat (4).  Finally wetlands in Madagascar have been declining for a long time as the climate has become increasingly drier (4) hinting at the negative impact global climate change could have on this species.,Fortunately the Madagascar heron occurs in four protected areas in west Madagascar (2) including Ankarafantsika Strict Reserve Ankarana Special Reserve and Baly Bay National Park but with around 50 percent of the global population living outside protected areas (4) clearly more needs to be done.  Surveys to locate important nesting and feeding sites of the Madagascar heron have been recommended (2) (4) as well as the effective protection of known sites and further research to determine this species\xe2\x80\x99 biology and conservation needs (2).

Conversion of shallow water bodies required by this species in the dry season to rice cultivation has been rife on the west coast of Madagascar and today mangroves are in demand for prawn pond construction and timber extraction both of which result in an increase in hunting for food (2) (5).,The Madagascar teal is listed as Endangered by the IUCN Red List which means that it faces a high risk of extinction in the wild (1). International trade in the species is controlled by its listing under Appendix II of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) (3). The Durrell Wildlife Conservation Trust initiated a captive breeding programme for this species in 1993. This programme has had great success and shed light on certain details of the life-cycle and behaviour of this elusive and shy duck.

For centuries Madagascar\xe2\x80\x99s forests have experienced successive waves of degradation at the hands of human colonists each with different destructive patterns of land use (7). In more recent years illegal and commercial logging charcoal production and burning to clear land for agriculture or cattle pasture have all had a devastating impact often changing open forest into dense shrubby undergrowth unsuitable as rat habitat or destroying the vegetation completely (3). The rats continue to suffer from human disturbance in the remaining forests which are used by the villagers to gather firewood collect honey dig up edible roots and hunt tenrecs and lemurs (3) (7). Predation by introduced predators such as dogs may also be playing a significant role in this species\xe2\x80\x99 decline (3).,This large rodent is in urgent need of conservation and its future remains highly uncertain. The Durrell Wildlife Conservation Trust is currently working closely with the Madagascan government and local community to help protect the species and has also established a captive breeding programme (5). The Menabe Forest an Alliance for Zero Extinction site due to the presence of this and a number of other endangered species was previously heavily impacted by subsistence farming wood extraction and livestock ranching. Fortunately in order to protect its unique but rapidly diminishing biodiversity the Madagascan government aims to expand the nation\xe2\x80\x99s protected area network and on March 28 2006 the Minister of the Environment Water and Forests signed a decree giving 125000 hectares of Menabe Forest temporary protected status. This is the first step towards making the site an official protected area. However while community and conservation groups have begun the slow process of agreeing on the official boundaries and goals of the new protected area (9) prospectors have begun using dynamite to search for oil reserves in Menabe causing concerns about further forest degradation (7).

With poor law enforcement hunting is an attractive source of income and both a change in public attitude to otters as well as increased law enforcement are necessary in order to slow the decline of this species. Conservation work is becoming more common in South America and it is hoped that this will create a higher level of awareness in the public about the marine otter\xe2\x80\x99s plight (2). ,loss;fishing;pollution; ,protected; ,3,1294,Sí€Œ£o Tomí€Œ© maroon pigeon; Sí€Œ£o Tomí€Œ© olive pigeon; Sí€Œ£o Tomí€Œ© pigeon,Columba thomensis,Maroon pigeon (Columba thomensis),Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Columbiformes,Columbidae,Columba (1),Length: 37 í¢ŒóŒñ 40 cm (2)Male weight: 520 í¢ŒóŒñ 530 g (2)Female weight: 350 í¢ŒóŒñ 352 g (2),On the island of S\xc3\xa3o Tom\xc3\xa9 large areas of forest have been cleared for coffee and cocoa plantations.

Habitat has been degraded throughout a long period of Polynesian occupancy through clearance for settlements agriculture and forestry fire regimes introduced vegetation and importation of mammalian herbivores including grazing feral stock although cattle have now been eradicated and goats and pigs are decreasing in number (3) (4). It is feared that construction of new roads may lead not only to further habitat loss but also to greater access and considerable disturbance to the last few remaining inaccessible refuges (3). Introduced predators such as cats and rats particularly black rats (<i>Rattus rattus</i>) are also thought to pose a serious potential threat to eggs nestlings juveniles and adults (3) (4). In addition black rats compete for fruit reducing the available food supply for the Marquesan imperial-pigeon (4).,The Marquesan imperial-pigeon is revered in local culture and hunting is prohibited although it clearly continues illegally (3). Fortunately campaigns to increase awareness of this species\xe2\x80\x99 plight appear to be reducing hunting pressure. In addition lobbying by the Ornithological Society of Polynesia (MANU) has successfully stopped the development of a new road and tunnel project that would have claimed parts of this species\xe2\x80\x99 habitat.

It is thought that these regions have been affected by particularly high levels of egg predation by both the black rat (<i>Rattus rattus</i>) and the crab-eating macaque (<i>Macaca fascicularis</i>) (6).,At present it would be impossible to eliminate all rats and macaques from the whole of Mauritius and therefore conservation efforts have focussed on establishing populations on offshore predator-free islands (3). The release of captive-bred individuals onto the predator\xe2\x80\x93free island of Ile aux Aigrettes in 2003 has proved successful with the population which is provided with supplementary food increasing to 151 individuals by July 2008 (3).

Deforestation of the surrounding lands has increased siltation in the rivers and lakes which along with drainage pollution the conversion of marshes to rice-paddies and the introduction of exotic plants and fishes has resulted in the reduction of Madagascar\xe2\x80\x99s native wetland inhabitants (5). Introduced large fish such as largemouth bass and snakehead are thought to have led to the Meller\xe2\x80\x99s duck deserting some areas (4). The enormous impact these threats could potentially have on Meller\xe2\x80\x99s ducks is illustrated by the plight of two waterbirds that once occurred in Lake Alaotra: the now extinct Delacour's grebe (<i>Tachybaptus rufolavatus</i>) and the recently re-discovered Madagascar pochard (<i>Aythya innotata</i>) (5) (6). Compounding the threat of habitat loss and degradation is hunting; around 450 ducks are killed each year from Lake Alaotra for food which constitutes an incredible 18 percent of the global population (2).,Meller\xe2\x80\x99s duck occurs in at least seven protected areas in Madagascar (2) and there are some laws in place to control hunting of this species. However these laws are often not enforced and hunting of this endangered bird continues (3). A captive population of Meller\xe2\x80\x99s ducks exists at Durrell Wildlife Conservation Trust Jersey where over 150 young have been successfully reared. This population not only acts as a safeguard should the species become extinct in the wild but it also allows extensive research to be undertaken gaining valuable information which may be used to formulate a conservation plan for the wild population (3). In the wild improved enforcement of hunting regulations and the development of protected areas that incorporate nesting sites are considered essential actions to ensure the survival of Meller\xe2\x80\x99s duck (4) (5). ,loss;hunting;pollution; ,protected; ,3,1304,Bagre de Muzquiz,Prietella phreatophila,Mexican blindcat (Prietella phreatophila),Animalia,Chordata,Actinopterygii,Siluriformes,Ictaluridae,Prietella (1),Length: up to 9.2 cm (2),The Mexican blindcat is considered by the World Conservation Union (IUCN) to be Endangered due to its restricted range and an inferred population decline (1).  The region in Mexico the blindcat inhabits is facing rapid population growth resulting in increased pressure on groundwater resources.  Interviews with local people indicate that the water tables have declined in recent decades which reduces the amount of available habitat for the Mexican blindcat.  Growing human populations also results in increased pollution which could contaminate the groundwater (6) further threatening the existence of this fish.,Despite the threats it faces the Mexican blindcat may inhabit underground waters that are undiscovered or inaccessible to humans and therefore the total number of individuals could potentially be large (6).  Further research to determine the population size and conservation status of the Mexican blindcat is required to inform future conservation actions to protect this peculiar species. ,pollution; , ,1,0305,big long-nosed bat; greater long-nosed bat,Leptonycteris nivalis,Mexican long-nosed bat (Leptonycteris nivalis),Animalia,Chordata,Mammalia,Chiroptera,Phyllostomidae,Leptonycteris (1),18 - 30 g (2) (3),The Mexican long-nosed bat has undergone a major population decline in recent years (1) (3) (6) and several caves in Mexico that once contained large numbers of bats now contain only small numbers or none at all (1) (6) (9). The main threat to the species is believed to come from a decrease in its food supply due to habitat clearance and the exploitation of agaves for the production of alcoholic drinks such as tequila (1) (3) (6) (9) (10). This harvest poses a particular threat as the agaves are harvested just before blooming preventing the plant from flowering and since agaves grow for 10 to 20 years flower only once and then die it can also prevent the agaves from reproducing (1) (6). The Mexican long-nosed bat\xe2\x80\x99s dependence on a continuous supply of food plants along its migratory routes also means that loss of the plants in any single area could have negative consequences for this species\xa0(9).,The only known <strong>colonial</strong> roosting site of the Mexican long-nosed bat in the United States is protected within the Big Bend National Park Texas (1) (3) (6) and the species is listed as Endangered on the US Endangered Species List (11).

The behaviour of massing in predictably located <strong>spawning</strong> aggregations has meant that these fish are easy targets caught by hook and line traps and spearguns (6). In the 1990s however fisheries documented a worrying decline in the size of catches and aggregations are no longer observed in Puerto Rico Bermuda or the United States Virgin Islands (3).,Following a massive lobbying effort by conservationists the Nassau grouper has finally received some of the protection it requires if numbers are going to recover from past exploitation (3). <strong>Spawning</strong> sites are protected in the Cayman Islands and fishing is banned in Belize during the spawning season (1). Other countries in the area however have been slow to introduce protection measures and extensive lobbying continues (1). , ,protected; ,0,1320,San Joaquin antelope ground squirrel; San Joaquin antelope squirrel,Ammospermophilus nelsoni,Nelson's antelope squirrel (Ammospermophilus nelsoni),Animalia,Chordata,Mammalia,Rodentia,Sciuridae,Ammospermophilus (1),142 í¢ŒóŒñ 179 g (2),The principal reason behind the dramatic decline of Nelson\xe2\x80\x99s antelope squirrel is the loss of its habitat to agricultural encroachment urbanisation overgrazing by livestock and oil and gas exploration. Now present in only 20 percent of its former range Nelson\xe2\x80\x99s antelope squirrel is extremely vulnerable to further habitat loss. In public owned reserves this rare species is protected from further declines but in private owned areas where the future management is uncertain its habitat is still threatened. The use of insecticides on agricultural pests has also been identified as a further threat to Nelson\xe2\x80\x99s antelope squirrel due to loss of prey while the historical use of rodenticides for the control of ground squirrels may have also contributed to the decline (1) (6). \xa0,Nelson\xe2\x80\x99s antelope squirrel has already benefited from several conservation measures aiming to protect its vulnerable habitat.\xa0 Several reserves have been created within the San Joaquin valley an area defined by a high degree of <strong>endemism</strong> including the Carrizo Plain National Monument and the Elkhorn Plain Ecological Preserve. This has offered Nelson\xe2\x80\x99s antelope squirrel some sanctuary; however several sites with substantial populations still receive no form of protection. Foremost in the drive to save this species should be the establishment of further protected areas in the Panoche and Kettleman hills and on the San Joaquin valley floor (1). Furthermore livestock grazing of natural grasslands should be limited while further surveys and monitoring of the density of this curious species is also required (6). ,loss; ,protected; ,1,1321,red-breasted dotterel; red-breasted plover,Charadrius obscurus,New Zealand dotterel (Charadrius obscurus),Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Charadriiformes,Charadriidae,Charadrius (1),130 - 170 g (3),Extinction of the New Zealand dotterel on the South Island was primarily caused by introduced predators (4) with the principle predators being hedgehogs stoats weasels gulls hawks rats cats and dogs (2). Feral cats and rats caused a rapid decline on Stewart Island (4) (5) and predation remains the greatest threat on the North Island (4). Habitat loss and human disturbance during breeding have also had a dramatic impact on populations and continue to pose serious threats (3). In particular housing industrial and tourism developments on the North Island combined with encroachment of dune-stabilising weeds have reduced habitat (4). Growing recreational use of the coastline is also set to increasingly impact on breeding roosting and feeding habitats (5). Indeed four-wheel drive vehicles picnickers and dogs can trample and disturb nests or draw defensive adults away from incubating their eggs (2). Additionally storms and very high tides can destroy nests (4) (6) and very few young survive to fledging age (2).,In 1993 the New Zealand Government\xe2\x80\x99s Department of Conservation published a national recovery plan for the New Zealand dotterel and management initiatives were implemented (3). On the North Island trapping of potential predators gull control and the implementation of signs and wardens to reduce human disturbance have all helped improve breeding success (4). Control of cats and rodents in four important breeding sites on Stewart Island has also helped increase survival in southern New Zealand dotterel populations which thankfully appear to be growing (4) (5). Captive breeding trials with the more abundant northern New Zealand dotterel have been undertaken partially as an experiment to see if individuals breed well in case such a programme should be needed in the future to bolster the low numbers of wild southern New Zealand dotterels. Chicks have been raised successfully in these trials highlighting captive breeding as a viable means of preserving the survival of the species should such methods ever be needed (4). ,loss; ,captive breeding; ,1,1322,í¢ŒóŒÖAí¢ŒóŒ»o,Puffinus newelli,Newellí¢ŒóŒ»s shearwater (Puffinus newelli),Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Procellariiformes,Procellariidae,Puffinus (1),Length: 33 cm (2)Male weight: 389 í¢ŒóŒñ 425 g (2)Female weight: 343 í¢ŒóŒñ 422 g (2),Since 1992 numbers of Newell\xe2\x80\x99s shearwaters on Kaua\xe2\x80\x99i have been declining.

However the introduction of SCUBA equipment in the 1960s meant that abalone could be collected in far greater numbers and led to the rampant over-harvesting and drastic decline of this species to the extent that collecting this species was eventually banned over much of its range (2) (5). However illegal poaching which is a lucrative enterprise motivated by high demand and elevated market prices due to the species\xe2\x80\x99 scarcity continues to pose a serious threat to the northern abalone (3). Furthermore there are law enforcement problems due to North America having large areas of uninhabited coastline in which constant monitoring is near impossible (1).,There are now a number of conservation measures underway to protect the northern abalone. A total ban on harvesting this species came into force in 1990 in British Columbia and partial bans and catch quotas now also exist elsewhere. A National Recovery Strategy and National Recovery Action Plan have been created in Canada which focus on improving law enforcement raising public support through communication campaigns conducting further research on the species and ongoing monitoring of its status and population trends. Although supplementing northern abalone populations could help accelerate its recovery reintroductions of hatchery-raised juveniles has proved costly and fairly ineffective in the past and therefore is not recommended as a valuable conservation tool in this instance (1). ,poaching;environment;pet; , ,3,0330,Helmeted curassow,Pauxi pauxi,Northern helmeted curassow (Pauxi pauxi),Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Galliformes,Cracidae,Pauxi (1),Length: 91 cm (2),The northern helmeted curassow has undergone a relatively rapid decline as the result of indiscriminate hunting and long-term destruction fragmentation and alteration of its habitat (2). Sadly wherever curassows occur they tend to be considered prime game species due to their large size and succulent flesh (4). This species has also at least formerly been illegally hunted for use of its bony casque to make traditional jewellery (2) (6).\xa0Essential forest habitat has been destroyed in both Venezuela and Colombia for conversion into cattle ranches at lower altitudes and for narcotics cultivation higher up (2). Furthermore opening up of forest habitat to human development only serves to increase the bird\xe2\x80\x99s vulnerability to the pressures of hunting and the limited range and low reproductive rate of this species only compound such threats (4).,Almost all remaining forests in northern Venezuela are now legally protected and records of this rare bird exist from 18 national parks but this has failed to safeguard it from the threat of poachers which continue to illegally hunt it within these areas (2) (6). The situation is worse in Colombia with the species being recorded within only one \xe2\x80\x98protected area\xe2\x80\x99 El Cocuy National Park Arauca which is also ineffectively protected (2). This rare curassow is legally protected in Venezuela and an education programme has been established to raise awareness of the plight of the bird and its habitat (2). Captive breeding and reintroduction of the bird have also been proposed for Venezuela as a means of restoring natural populations where they have declined (2) (7). However until legislation against hunting is strictly enforced and national parks are adequately protected reintroduced individuals may have a poor chance of survival. Thus conservation efforts should focus on protecting existing populations and the ever diminishing habitat on which they rely. ,fragmentation;hunting; ,captive breeding;protected; ,2,2331,Diomedea epomophora sanfordi,Diomedea sanfordi,Northern royal albatross (Diomedea sanfordi),Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Procellariiformes,Diomedeidae,Diomedea (1),Size (beak to tail): 1.15 m (2)Wingspan: up to 3.2 m (3),A storm that hit the Chatham Islands in 1985 had a dramatic impact on the reproductive success of the northern royal albatross reducing soil cover and destroying all vegetation so that nests had to be constructed with stones or eggs simply laid on bare rock. As a result annual reproductive success plummeted due to egg breakage high temperatures and flooding in temporary pools. Introduced predators pose an additional threat with stoats (<i>Mustela erminea</i>) and cats known to take eggs and chicks at Taiaroa Head. Albatrosses are notoriously vulnerable to becoming entangled in fishing equipment whilst feeding on baited hooks or catch and mortality due to longline fishing activities may pose a future threat to this species (2).,All populations of the northern royal albatross are monitored annually and predator control initiatives at Taiaroa Head during the breeding season have dramatically improved annual reproductive success rates. Feral cattle rabbits and mice have all been eradicated from Enderby Island and Taiaroa Head and Enderby Island are established as nature reserves (2).

This removes dead and fallen trees which numbats need for shelter and termites need for resources (4). Another factor could be the suppression of Aboriginal fire regimes after the movement of Aboriginal people away from their traditional lands following the European settlement of Australia.

Whilst much of the area in which it inhabits is inaccessible and unexplored in other parts deforestation occurs at an alarmingly high rate as forest is cleared for crops such as marijuana and coffee (5). <strong>Slash-and-burn</strong> agriculture in the area is also increasing catalysed by the recent paving of a highway that traverses the region (6).,The ochre-fronted antpitta has been found near the Alto Mayo Protected Forest (2) but this area is itself critically threatened due to deforestation for agriculture and grazing illegal extraction of wildlife high levels of human migration and indiscriminate hunting (7). The American Bird Conservancy together with Asociaci\xc3\xb3n Ecosistemas Andinos (ECOAN) is running a project to conserve threatened birds and other wildlife around Abra Patricia (a site within the antpitta\xe2\x80\x99s range) by establishing a new private reserve and field station (6). In addition it has been proposed that surveys and research of the species should be undertaken along with enforcing the protection of the Alto Mayo Protected Forest and ensuring that high-altitude forest habitat suitable for the antpitta is included within its boundaries (2) (3). ,loss; ,protected; ,1,1335,Brauní¢ŒóŒ»s bush-shrike,Laniarius brauni,Orange-breasted bush-shrike (Laniarius brauni),Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Malaconotidae,Laniarius (1),Length: 20 cm (2),The region of Angola inhabited by the orange-breasted bush-shrike has been subject to steady deforestation in recent decades with an increase in <strong>slash-and-burn</strong> cultivation and the removal of timber trees.  As the orange-breasted bush-shrike is known from only a small area this habitat destruction poses a great threat to the species\xe2\x80\x99 survival (2).,It is possible that the orange-breasted bush-shrike may occur within the Kisama (or Qui\xc3\xa7\xc3\xa3ma) National Park (2) although even within this supposedly protected area there are continuous problems with illegal cultivation cutting and other pressures from the human population inhabiting the park (5).  There are currently no known conservation measures in place for this Endangered species although it has been recommended that surveys to determine the distribution and population size of the orange-breasted bush-shrike along with assessments of the current extent of forest cover should be undertaken once the civil unrest in Angola subsides (2). , ,protected; ,0,1336,Orbost spiny cray,Euastacus diversus,Orbost spiny crayfish (Euastacus diversus),Animalia,Arthropoda,Crustacea,Decapoda,Parastacidae,Euastacus (1),Occipital carapace length: up to 3.2 cm (2)Total length: c. 7 - 7.9 cm (3),The Orbost spiny crayfish has a highly fragmented and restricted distribution (1) (4) and is uncommon at the sites it inhabits (1) (5). One of the main threats to this freshwater species is a continuing decline in the quality of its habitat as a result of timber harvesting and forest management activities. Together with associated road building activities timber harvesting can affect water run-off into the streams this crayfish inhabits as well as increasing the amounts of sediment and nutrients washing into the water (1) (4) (5).,There are no specific conservation measures currently aimed at the Orbost spiny crayfish.

In Russia breeding sites are also at risk from spring fires which bring down tall trees suitable for nesting forcing delayed nesting and reduced reproductive success. At the wintering sites in China over-fishing has reduced the availability of prey species for the Oriental white stork. Throughout the range this stork is hunted and collected for zoos despite legal protection (3).,The Oriental white stork is legally protected in Russia Mongolia China North Korea South Korea and Japan. It also benefits from many protected areas in both Russia and China. <strong>Re-introduction</strong> programmes in South Korea and Japan should help to reduce declines but further protected areas are necessary to prevent habitat loss being the cause of this species\xe2\x80\x99 extinction. The maintenance of tall trees and the addition of artificial nest poles in potential breeding areas as well as control of human disturbance at nest sites during the breeding season should also encourage increased breeding success.

This large-scale extraction is thought to be the cause of the large declines suffered by this bird but guano harvests continue every five to seven years regardless. Hunting also continues and many birds are killed by the fishing industry as <strong>by-catch</strong>. Introduced rats cats and foxes have exterminated the Peruvian diving-petrel on many islands and continue to pose a threat to the remaining populations (2).,All breeding colonies of the Peruvian diving-petrel are found in reserves but only one of these benefits from trained guards. Searches have taken place to find further colonies in Chile but to no avail. As the threats to this species continue with no sign of abatement it is crucial to address them.

Selective logging may also remove key fruiting trees such as figs and open up the forest to further hunting (1) (14) while the building of the Transoceanic highway between Brazil and Peru brings the threat of increased hunting and deforestation throughout the southern part of the species\xe2\x80\x99 range (1). Its dependence on mature undisturbed forest makes the Peruvian spider monkey particularly vulnerable to habitat loss and degradation while its slow reproductive rate means that populations take a long time to recover from any losses (1) (2) (5) (8) (15).,The Peruvian spider monkey occurs in many protected areas throughout its range (1) and international trade in the species should be regulated under its listing on Appendix II of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) (3).

Off-road vehicles have also led to increased access and therefore disturbance to previously inaccessible breeding areas. In Chile current concerns include the building of port facilities at Mejillones off-road driving at Rio Loa and the construction of coastal highways throughout the north. In Paracas Bay Peru increased pollution may also pose a risk to the birds (5). Furthermore with greater development and human encroachment on the Peruvian tern\xe2\x80\x99s breeding habitat comes a greater threat from domestic animals such as dogs and cats which may disturb prey or trample upon eggs and young chicks (3). This already rare bird has also undoubtedly suffered from the 1972 collapse of anchovetta stocks an important food source which have not subsequently recovered (5).,There are currently no known conservation measures underway to protect the Peruvian tern (5).

Predation by introduced species such as the macaque (<i>Macaca fasicularis</i>) mongoose (<i>Herpestes auropunctatus</i>) rats and feral cats have further decimated the population (6). Cyclones also batter the island destroying nest sites (2).,The pink pigeon has been rescued from the very brink of extinction by an intensive management programme in partnership between the Durrell Wildlife Conservation Trust (8) Mauritian Wildlife Foundation and the Wildlife Preservation Trust Canada (7). A captive breeding programme began in the early 1980s (6) and Gerald Durrell released the first individuals into the wild in 1984 (9). As of 2002 there are around 350 birds in the wild (9) and the project is fast approaching its target of 500 individuals (6). To supplement the captive breeding and release programme conservation efforts such as the establishment of Conservation Management Areas habitat restoration control of predators and supplementary feeding has enabled this species to increase in abundance (2).

However by 2005 the numbers of cats and rats had recovered and after two unsuccessful eradication attempts there may be little support for a third (3). Habitat degradation is also a threat due to clearance for crops and gardening browsing by goats overexploitation for wood and the spread of introduced plants such as the rose apple. Today only remnants of the original vegetation remain (3) (4).

However further attempts to control or eradicate these predators have been recommended (3). The Pitcairn reed-warbler is protected from killing or egg-collection under Local Government Regulations 1971 (4) and it has been suggested that the islanders be involved in monitoring its population.

It is thought that breeding success is affected by the presence of several introduced species on the islands including cattle sheep pigs cats dogs rats and the weka bird (<i>Gallirallus australis</i>). Birds are sometimes illegally shot by fisherman for stealing their catch and they are also caught in very large numbers in crayfish pots. Changes in the marine environment associated with climate change may be affecting the prey species of the Pitt Island shag (2).,The sheep and cattle of Rangatira were removed in 1961 as were the sheep of Mangere Island in 1968.

All nesting sites on Niuafo'ou are harvested by the local human population with at least 50 % of all eggs being collected or destroyed. Adults are also hunted on a smaller scale and both adults and chicks suffer from predation by feral cats and dogs. Pigs may pose an additional threat by competing for food. Fortunately Fonualei is uninhabited and little-visited so the population there is relatively safe from the threats of hunting and human disturbance (5). In 2003 an incredible 300 to 500 birds were estimated to exist on the island a significant increase from the 35 eggs and chicks that were introduced in 1993. Following this remarkable discovery which effectively doubled the total known population of Polynesian megapode the species was downlisted from Critically Endangered to Endangered on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species (5) (3).,The Polynesian megapode is legally protected although in practice there is no real enforcement and egg-collecting urgently needs to be brought under control. From 1991 to 1993 60 eggs were introduced on Late Island buried at volcanically heated sites and 35 eggs and chicks were transferred to Fonualei both islands being uninhabited rarely visited and with appropriate egg-laying conditions. While surveys suggest the reintroduction on Late failed the now established population on Fonualei is a fantastic conservation success story and provides new hope for the future of this rare bird. It has been advocated that Fonualei should be given Reserve status and if achieved this volcanic island may prove to be the safe refuge that ensures the Polynesian megapodes long-term survival (5).

Preuss\xe2\x80\x99s guenon is particularly vulnerable to hunting due to its fairly large size and its semi-terrestrial habits; spending time on land increases its risk of being killed. Hunting of this species is a particular problem on the island of Bioko (1).,A significant hindrance to the conservation of this species is that no <strong>montane forest</strong> in the Cameroon highlands is currently protected; this situation needs to urgently change as it is the most critical remaining habitat for Preuss\xe2\x80\x99s guenon.

Vast areas of the native rainforest have been cleared for timber and for the construction of oil-palm plantations which now constitute one of Malaysia's top exports (4). Proboscis monkeys do not adapt to degraded habitat and recent technical advances have meant that even mangrove swamps may now be logged (4). Hunting is also a threat to the survival of this species; their propensity to gather in large groups on the river's edge makes these monkeys easy targets (4).,The proboscis monkey is protected by law (4) and is listed on Appendix I of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) banning international trade (3).

Vast areas of the native rainforest have been cleared for timber and for the construction of oil-palm plantations which now constitute one of Malaysia's top exports (4). Proboscis monkeys do not adapt to degraded habitat and recent technical advances have meant that even mangrove swamps may now be logged (4). Hunting is also a threat to the survival of this species; their propensity to gather in large groups on the river's edge makes these monkeys easy targets (4).,The proboscis monkey is protected by law (4) and is listed on Appendix I of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) banning international trade (3). This species is found in at least a dozen protected areas (2).

Thankfully it has been possible to reintroduce this unique survivor into the wild. However those reintroduced populations still face threats; primarily that of <strong>hybridisation</strong> with domestic horses along with competition with domestic horses for resources (1).,After the <strong>subspecies</strong> became Extinct in the Wild it clung on in a number of small populations in various zoos around the world. In 1977 the Foundation for the Preservation and Protection of the Przewalski's horse (FPPPH) was established in the Netherlands with the long-term aim of returning this ancient horse to the wild (6). At that time there were around 300 horses in zoos and parks and their breeding was managed in order to prevent <strong>inbreeding</strong> (6). In the 1990s The Mongolian Association for Conservation of Nature and the Environment (MACNE) and the FPPPH collaborated to reintroduce a number of individuals in small herds into the Hustai National Park in central Mongolia (7). The national symbol was a welcome return to the area and part of an important drive to save the steppe biotope (6). Today more than 120 Przewalski's horses live in Hustai and a further conservation programme run by the International Takhi Group (a consortium of European takhi breeding institutions) together with the Mongolian Commission for Endangered Species has introduced a further 50 horses to an area in the Dzungarian Gobi in Southwest Mongolia (5). The return of the Przewalski's horse to its natural environment is a success story for conservation and despite ongoing problems it is hoped that at least two large self-sustained populations will soon be a reality (7). ,hunting;pet; , ,2,0359,pig-nosed frog,Nasikabatrachus sahyadrensis,Purple frog (Nasikabatrachus sahyadrensis),Animalia,Chordata,Amphibia,Anura,Nasikabatrachidae,Nasikabatrachus (1),Snout-vent length: 5.3 í¢ŒóŒñ 9 cm (2),Known from only 135 individuals of which only three are female the purple frog is thought to be an extremely rare species. The main threat to this elusive frog is the loss of its forest habitat to encroaching agriculture (1). Within the Western Ghats over 90 percent of the forest has been lost with conversion to coffee cardamom ginger and other crop plantations the most significant agents (1) (2). The potential for dam developments to inundate vast areas of its habitat also mean that the status of the purple frog is extremely precarious (7).,Due to its threatened status and evolutionary distinctiveness the purple frog is categorised as a focal species on the Zoological Society of London\xe2\x80\x99s EDGE of Existence programme. This project aims to highlight the need for the conservation of this unique species while establishing a set of conservation priorities and as a result studies are currently being undertaken to investigate the purple frog\xe2\x80\x99s ecology and threats (5).\xa0 ,loss; ,protected; ,1,1360,Colibrí€Œ_ de Alicia,Aglaeactis aliciae,Purple-backed sunbeam (Aglaeactis aliciae),Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Apodiformes,Trochilidae,Aglaeactis (1),7.3 í¢ŒóŒñ 8.3 g (2),Restricted to a very small area that is heavily populated the greatest threat to the purple-backed sunbeam is the conversion of <i>Alnus</i> dominated shrubland to <i>Eucalyptus</i> plantations as this removes the <strong>parasitic</strong> mistletoe upon which it feeds (4).\xa0The species\xe2\x80\x99 restricted range also makes it vulnerable to the effects of chance natural events such as disease and drought while the low population number estimated at less than 1000 birds may mean that it has a very low genetic diversity. Historically the Maranon River landscape has undergone high levels of habitat conversion for cultivation and much of the original natural habitat has been lost or continues to be degraded.\xa0Cattle ranching logging and firewood collecting has removed much of the forest habitat while oil extraction is a potential future problem (4) (7).,The Maranon valley home to the purple-backed sunbeam is an area of high conservation importance as its isolation and unique habitats has resulted in a large degree of <strong>endemism</strong>.\xa0A total of twenty two bird species are <strong>endemic</strong> to the valley and as a result it has been designated as a Birdlife International Endemic Bird Area (EBA) (7).\xa0The Maranon valley has also been designated as part of the Maranon-Alto Mayo Conservation corridor as it supports a high number of conservation priority areas. \xa0The American Bird Conservancy has been working to analyse the distribution of rare bird species within the Maranon valley and identify the areas and habitats that require protection.\xa0A wide array of conservation strategies have been proposed including strict protected area status sustainable conservation and community owned nature reserves.

Fetching thousands of dollars per butterfly this rare species has suffered severely from over harvesting (4). Recognising a dramatic decline in 1966 the Papua New Guinea government gave Queen Alexandra\xe2\x80\x99s birdwing legal protection from collectors. Consequently trade in this butterfly has been somewhat reduced but illegal collection continues to threaten this species. Today however the greatest threat to Queen Alexandra\xe2\x80\x99s birdwing is the loss of its lowland rainforest habitat. Historically forests were cleared for subsistence farming and logging and large tracts of forest were destroyed by the volcanic eruption of Mount Lamington in 1951. Presently the main cause behind forest loss is the expansion of the palm oil industry compounded by the development of rubber and cocoa plantations (7).\xa0\xa0,Threatened by illegal trade and habitat loss the survival of Queen Alexandra\xe2\x80\x99s birdwing is dependant upon the successful implementation of conservation measures. To abate trade pressure Queen Alexandra\xe2\x80\x99s birdwing is listed on Appendix I of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) and as an Annex A species in the EU Council Regulation on trade of wild species both of which prohibit international trade (2) (3). Furthermore the Papua New Guinea government has provided financial aid to local communities to develop butterfly nurseries.\xa0 These licensed farms aim to sustainably trade wild butterflies whilst providing local communities with an additional income and improving the long-term survival prospects of many rare butterfly species (8). In addition a large wildlife management area has been created protecting much Queen Alexandra\xe2\x80\x99s birdwing habitat.

There is some evidence that this exploitation is having a negative effect on red porgy populations; for example in southern Brazil trawl fishing during the 1970s left red porgy stocks over-exploited (10).,In some areas of its range fishery regulations exist for the red porgy.  For instance off the southern coast of the United States there is a size limit in place a ban on the sale or purchase of red porgy between January and April (an important spawning period) and limits to how many can be caught during a fishing trip (11). ,fishing; , ,1,0369,Cardenalito; Lí€Œ_gano Cardenalito; Lí€Œ_gano Encapuchado,Carduelis cucullata,Red siskin (Carduelis cucullata),Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Fringillidae,Carduelis (1),Length: 10 cm (2),The red siskin is under threat from illegal trapping for the cage bird industry which has caused a rapid decline in numbers of this species over the last 150 years.

The attractive plumage of the red-and-blue lory has made it a popular cage bird for over a century and consequently wild birds have been intensively trapped to fulfil the demand for international trade. Trapping began as early as the 19<sup>th</sup>century with most birds being traded within Indonesia and the Philippines. Trapping intensified in the 1990s with an estimated 1000 to 2000 birds leaving Karakelang each year (6). Around 3500 birds were traded between 1992 and 1993 which attracted more trappers and resulted in the development of modern more efficient trapping methods. In 1995 the red-and-blue lory was at last listed under Appendix I of CITES which prohibited international trade excluding exceptional circumstances such as scientific research (3). However trapping continued in the latter 1990s with an estimated 80 percent of the illegal trade going to the Philippines (7).\xa0\xa0,Karakelang is believed to contain the only remaining viable population of the red-and-blue lory and consequently efforts are underway to reduce trade on the island (7) (10). The Action Sampiri project is working to improve awareness amongst local communities about the global importance of the island to the species and to improve future land use. Investigations by the wildlife trade monitoring network TRAFFIC and the inclusion of the species on the Indonesian list of protected species also highlights the species\xe2\x80\x99 plight and the urgent need for the application of conservation measures (7). A substantial part of the red-and-blue lory\xe2\x80\x99s range is within the Karakelang Wildlife Sanctuary although there is believed to be no management plan for this protected area and the level of law enforcement varies. The red-and-blue lory will also benefit from numerous proposed conservation measures including the monitoring of population trends and trapping levels the strict enforcement of trade legislation provision of training and resources to park management staff and the continuation of community awareness programmes (6). ,loss;disease;pet; ,protected; ,3,1371,Blumenbachí¢ŒóŒ»s curassow; mutum,Crax blumenbachii,Red-billed curassow (Crax blumenbachii),Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Galliformes,Cracidae,Crax (1),c. 3.5 kg (2),The red-billed curassow has suffered from habitat loss and hunting and is now thought to be on the brink of extinction with fewer than 250 individuals estimated to remain in small fragmented subpopulations. Virtually all lowland forest north of Rio de Janeiro has disappeared outside of reserves having been converted to plantations and pastureland. Even in Monte Pascoal National Park habitat loss continues as a result of conflicts over the land rights of local people. Hunting and capture for the bird trade persist in some reserves and are likely to have a severe impact on such small fragmented populations (4).,This rare bird is protected under Brazilian law and listed on Appendix I of CITES making international trade in the species illegal. Of the few reserves where this species can still be found Sooretama and Linhares are the most effectively protected and contain strongholds of over 60 and 100 individuals respectively (4). A captive-breeding and reintroduction programme in a number of protected sites in 1990 and 1991 has been highly successful helping to boost numbers in the wild but the total population nevertheless remains extremely small (2) (4). If this large and distinctive forest bird is to survive it is imperative that all reserves with known populations are vigilantly patrolled and protected to prevent the hunting and trapping that continue to threaten its existence (4). ,loss;hunting; ,cites;protected; ,2,2372,Barnacla Cuellirroja,Branta ruficollis,Red-breasted goose (Branta ruficollis),Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Anseriformes,Anatidae,Branta (1),Length: 53 í¢ŒóŒñ 56 cm (2),Hunting in Bulgaria as well as in Romania and Ukraine is a threat for the red-breasted goose. Tourist trips for hunting are becoming more common in Ukraine and birds are often shot at the breeding grounds in Russia. Additionally climate change is expected to alter tundra habitats and thereby reduce breeding success. The use of rodenticides in the wintering grounds has also had a deleterious impact upon populations of the red-breasted goose (2) (8).,The red-breasted goose is legally protected in many key states and parts of the breeding and wintering ranges are protected but hunting continues regardless. Wintering sites in Bulgaria Romania and Ukraine are on a monitoring programme through the Red-breasted Goose Monitoring and Research Programme. The goal is to provide up-to-date information regarding the status of the species its habitat movements ecology and conservation needs (10). In Bulgaria a management plan is being implemented for roosting lakes (2). In Romania a management plan was drafted for Lake Techirghiol in 2008 along with the Romanian National Action Plan (10). An International Action Plan was published in 1996 which proposed a number of conservation measures for the red-breasted goose.

Habitat destruction has been rife and is primarily the result of conversion to plantations and pastureland and logging operations (2) (5). Surviving populations are small and fragmented and now suffer from reduced foraging sites increased competition for nesting areas and the effects of genetic isolation (2). Yet deforestation continues compounded by the ever-present threat of capture for the domestic pet trade driving this rare parrot into a steep decline (2) (6). Sadly the species is not even safe in reserves with most of the 174 nestlings poached for the national and international cage-bird trade in the 1998 to 1999 breeding season reportedly coming from \xe2\x80\x98protected areas\xe2\x80\x99. Souvenirs containing feathers have also been seen for sale outside Monte Pascoal National Park (5).,The red-browed Amazon is protected under Brazilian law and occurs in 14 reserves though most of these provide very little habitat protection on the ground and none are effective against poaching (5). Captive breeding though difficult has been successful in America and Europe and a global management plan for captive red-browed Amazons is now underway (2) (6). Reintroductions into the wild from captive stock may become an important conservation strategy in the future but it is unlikely to successfully bolster numbers until sufficient habitat is secured that can sustain expanded wild flocks (2). Thus law enforcement and <i>in situ</i> conservation to protect the diminishing Atlantic forests of Brazil must remain priorities in the protection of this and other <strong>endemic</strong> species if they are going to have any kind of future in the wild. ,pet; ,captive breeding;protected; ,1,2374,red-cheeked macaw,Ara rubrogenys,Red-fronted macaw (Ara rubrogenys),Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Psittaciformes,Psittacidae,Ara (1),Length: 55 - 60 cm (2),The reasons for the drastic decline of this species include widespread habitat loss and degradation largely as a result of conversion to agriculture but also caused by logging and collection of firewood. This species is illegally trapped for the pet trade but the scale of this problem is unclear. Furthermore as the natural food sources of this bird are lost it has to rely more on crops and it becomes increasingly exposed to persecution as a result (2).,The red-fronted macaw is listed under Appendix I and II of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) and so international trade in this species is tightly controlled (3). Within Bolivia the capture transport and export of this species are illegal. This macaw occurs in just one protected area but just eight birds are known to breed within this park. Birdlife Bolivia initiated a conservation programme for this species in 2002 which incorporates surveying and monitoring of the species identifying priority areas of habitat for the species and establishing a community awareness programme in the area. Other proposed measures include the complete elimination of trade in this bird and fencing-off areas of suitable habitat to reduce grazing by livestock allowing the natural vegetation to make a come-back (2). ,loss;pet; ,cites;protected; ,2,2375,douc; red-shanked douc langur,Pygathrix nemaeus,Red-shanked douc (Pygathrix nemaeus),Animalia,Chordata,Mammalia,Primates,Cercopithecidae,Pygathrix (1),Male tail length: 60 - 74 cm (2)Male head-body length: 55 - 60 cm (2)Female head-body length: c. 60 cm (2)Female tail length: c. 60 cm (2)Male weight: 10.9 - 12.6 kg (2)Female weight: 8.2 - 8.9 kg (2),The red-shanked douc suffers from intense levels of hunting for food and for use in traditional \xe2\x80\x98medicines\xe2\x80\x99 as well as capture for the live pet trade (1) (5) (7). Although laws exist to protect this species from hunting throughout its range such protective legislation is rarely enforced (1). This rare primate is particularly vulnerable to this exploitation as when disturbed it remains motionless in the canopy instead of fleeing making it an easy hunting target (1) (5). It has also suffered from extensive habitat loss particularly in the Central Highlands of Vietnam where large tracts of forest were damaged during wartimes (1) (8). More recently a rapidly expanding human population in this region has resulted in agricultural expansion with forest areas converted to farmlands and increased logging for coffee rubber and cashew plantations (1) (5).,The red-shanked douc is afforded the highest level of protection in Vietnam under the Wildlife Protection Law and should be protected from international trade by its listing on Appendix I of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) (3) (8). It also receives a degree of protection in a number of national parks and reserves including several in the Nam Theum basin in Lao PDR which is thought to support the largest remaining population of the species although hunting is still prevalent in many protected areas (7). There is also an ongoing captive-breeding programme for the red-shanked douc at the Endangered Primate Rescue Center at Cuc Phuong National Park in Vietnam (9). In addition the Douc Langur Foundation has been undertaking comprehensive surveys of this species in an effort to understand the distribution of populations which is vital for any successful conservation programme.

It has also suffered from extensive habitat loss particularly in the Central Highlands of Vietnam where large tracts of forest were damaged during wartimes (1) (8). More recently a rapidly expanding human population in this region has resulted in agricultural expansion with forest areas converted to farmlands and increased logging for coffee rubber and cashew plantations (1) (5).,The red-shanked douc is afforded the highest level of protection in Vietnam under the Wildlife Protection Law and should be protected from international trade by its listing on Appendix I of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) (3) (8). It also receives a degree of protection in a number of national parks and reserves including several in the Nam Theum basin in Lao PDR which is thought to support the largest remaining population of the species although hunting is still prevalent in many protected areas (7). There is also an ongoing captive-breeding programme for the red-shanked douc at the Endangered Primate Rescue Center at Cuc Phuong National Park in Vietnam (9). In addition the Douc Langur Foundation has been undertaking comprehensive surveys of this species in an effort to understand the distribution of populations which is vital for any successful conservation programme. The Foundation\xe2\x80\x99s studies are also helping to uncover greater knowledge of this still poorly understood primate such as group size and composition and social interactions (10). WWF\xe2\x80\x99s Indochina Programme is also carrying out vital research into the effectiveness of national parks within Vietnam and trains reserve rangers in primate survey techniques (11). The effective enforcement of existing laws and national parks will be the key to ensuring the future of this attractive and appealing primate (7). ,loss;hunting;pet; ,cites;protection law;protected;wwf; ,3,4377,red slate ornamental; red slate ornamental tarantula; reddish parachute tarantula; rufus parachute spider; Travancore slate-red,Poecilotheria rufilata,Reddish parachute spider (Poecilotheria rufilata),Animalia,Arthropoda,Arachnida,Araneae,Theraphosidae,Poecilotheria (1),Male total length: c. 3.2 cm (2) (3)Female total length: c. 6 cm (3)Male carapace length: c. 1.7 cm (2) (3)Female carapace length: c. 3 cm (3),Population figures for the reddish parachute spider are unavailable but as it is an <strong>endemic</strong> species found only in small fragmented areas in India it is thought that its population trend is decreasing (1).,Currently the reddish parachute spider and its relatives are not listed under the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES). It has been recommended that the reddish parachute spider be included under Appendix II of CITES which would mean that international trade in this species should be carefully controlled. This colourful spider also needs to be protected in India under wildlife protection acts to prevent it being removed from the wild for the pet trade (1). ,loss;fragmentation;pet; ,cites;protected; ,3,2378,Rodrigues brush-warbler,Acrocephalus rodericanus,Rodrigues warbler (Acrocephalus rodericanus),Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Sylviidae,Acrocephalus (1),11 í¢ŒóŒñ 13 g (2),During the 1950s and 60s the natural habitat of Rodrigues Island was extensively cleared for timber firewood and farming (5) (6) leaving it one of the most degraded tropical oceanic islands in the world (4) and significantly decreasing the warbler population (5).  Then in 1968 one of the most severe cyclones to ever have hit Rodrigues struck and with a search in 1969 failing to find any warblers it was thought to have wiped out one of the island\xe2\x80\x99s <strong>endemic</strong> birds (5).  Thankfully the species had not gone extinct and numbers have since recovered slightly primarily due to an increase in forest cover through habitat protection and <strong>afforestation</strong> (5).,The slow recovery of the Rodrigues warbler since 1969 has been the result of efforts to protect the island\xe2\x80\x99s watersheds which allowed the surrounding forests to mature and recover and a switch to the use of bottled gas for cooking lessening the demand for firewood (5) (6).  Nature has also played a role in this species\xe2\x80\x99 recovery with a recent absence of catastrophic cyclones allowing populations to increase (6).  While much of the reforestation has involved exotic trees native species are being replanted in some areas including two Conservation Management Areas where grazing animals and woodcutters are kept out and exotic plants are removed (6).  Exotic plant species are a major cause of the lack of native habitat on the island but these introduced trees and shrubs also provide a vital haven for the Rodrigues warbler in the absence of native forest.  For the native forest to regenerate it is considered necessary to remove all exotic tree species but this may have a short-term detrimental impact on warbler populations.  Hopefully the long-term benefit to the island and to the Rodrigues warbler will outweigh this short-term loss (5).  To mitigate the potential catastrophic effects of another introduced predator catastrophic cyclone or drought the possibility of introducing the warblers to a small predator-free island has also been considered and feasibility studies have been undertaken (5). , , ,0,0379,Chirixalus romeri; Philautus romeri,Liuixalus romeri,Romer's treefrog (Liuixalus romeri),Animalia,Chordata,Amphibia,Anura,Rhacophoridae,Liuixalus (1),Length: 1.5 - 2.5 cm (2),Romer\xe2\x80\x99s treefrog is primarily threatened by human disturbance and habitat destruction (1) (2) (5) while habitat degradation due to pollution is also a major threat to this species (5).

In West Africa Rueppell\xe2\x80\x99s griffon has been heavily exploited for use in Black Magic (7).,Rueppell\xe2\x80\x99s griffon occurs in a number of protected areas throughout its range including Serengeti National Park Tanzania; a World Heritage Site and an important feeding area for the griffon (8).

As with many islands in the region little of the original forest cover may now remain (7). This species is not thought to be very tolerant of habitat disturbance and its small and highly fragmented range puts it at even greater risk of extinction (1) but little information is available on its exact status (2).,There are not known to be any specific conservation measures currently in place for this poorly-known mammal.

Habitat loss is the main threat to this bird (2) with the island it inhabits losing 75 percent of its native vegetation cover since 1946 (7).  Cultivation and urbanisation have eliminated native forest from all but the steepest of slopes (2) and the high level of human population growth and economic development on R\xc3\xa9union Island has resulted in an increase in urbanisation road construction and tourism causing further habitat destruction (2) (4).  The natural habitat is also degraded by exotic plants making the land more susceptible to the impacts of cyclones heavy rains and fires (2).,There are a number of protected areas on R\xc3\xa9union Island and it is vital that the remaining suitable habitat for the R\xc3\xa9union harrier is protected from further degradation and that public awareness campaigns are developed in order to stop poaching and persecution (2) (7).

For a species with so few individuals the rapid degradation and destruction of Madagascar\xe2\x80\x99s bio-diverse wetlands poses a very serious threat to its long-term survival. In Madagascar human encroachment and conversion of habitat for rice cultivation is widely responsible for a massive reduction in the area of wetlands. For the Sakalava rail the introduction of non-native fish and a decline in reed habitat partially attributable to harvesting by humans is likely to be having an additional negative impact (2). Fortunately the Sakalava rail is considered too small for hunting and in some areas it is even traditionally taboo to collect its eggs (2) (3).,In January 2007 the Madagascar government passed legislation granting the protection of the Mahavavy-Kinkony Wetlands a 300000 hectare wildlife area and home to all of western Madagascar\xe2\x80\x99s wetland birds including the Sakalava rail (5). Further to the statutory protection of such a large area of Sakalava rail habitat it is hoped that in the near future a national conservation plan specific to the species will be established. For the development of such a plan it is vital to gain a greater understanding of its ecology and distribution. Given that there are many areas with suitable habitat that have not yet been surveyed there is some optimism that the Sakalava rail population may be larger than the current estimates suggest (2). ,hunting; , ,1,0389,saker,Falco cherrug,Saker falcon (Falco cherrug),Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Falconiformes,Falconidae,Falco (1),Male length: 45 cm(2)Female length: 55 cm (2)Male wingspan: 100Œæ- 110 cm (2)Female wingspan: 120Œæ- 130 cm (2)Male weight: 730Œæ- 990 g (2)Female weight: 970Œæ- 1300 g (2),The saker falcon has undergone a rapid decline in recent years particularly in the Middle East and Asia due to trapping for the falconry trade and now faces the very real threat of extinction (6). Of those captured for the falconry trade the vast majority are thought to be young females creating a major age and sex bias in the wild population that dramatically reduces its breeding potential (2) (6). Females are preferred by falconers due to their larger size and young birds because they are easier to train than adults (2). In Europe the saker falcon is mainly threatened by the loss and degradation of <strong>steppe</strong> and dry grassland habitat due to agricultural expansion and declines in sheep pastoralism which has in turn reduced the sakavailability of key prey species and suitable hunting ground (6). Across the bird\xe2\x80\x99s range declines are also the result of predation (by eagle owls steppe eagles and golden eagles) human persecution electrocution shooting poaching and accidental poisoning through pesticides which contaminate the falcon\xe2\x80\x99s prey (2) (6) (7). In some parts of its range rodent plagues result in the extensive use of poisons to control them causing the indiscriminate deaths of many raptors that feed on them (5) (7).,The saker falcon is protected across much of its range particularly in Eastern Europe where controls of illegal trade were implemented in various countries in the 1990s (6). There have been concerted conservation efforts in Europe and intensive patrolling and management has even produced a steadily rising population in Hungary (5) (6). The species is listed on Appendix II of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) and in 2002 CITES imposed a trade ban on the United Arab Emirates (3).

An introduced population of Acklin\xe2\x80\x99s iguanas (<i>C. r. nuchalis</i>) currently thrives on an island within the Exumas Land and Sea Park (6) and a successful translocation of five adult pairs of <i>C. r. rileyi</i> from Green Cay to Cut Cay took place in February 2005 funded by a 2004 grant from the International Iguana Foundation (7). Candidate cays for further reintroductions (and source of animals) include Barn Cay (from Guana Cay) Cato Cay (from Green Cay) and High Cay (from Low Cay). Corrective actions may first be required to render each cay suitable for reintroduction (e.g. removal of feral rats) and reintroduction of iguanas on the mainland should be undertaken only if large areas are protected particularly from the feral dogs and cats that are already numerous in local areas (4). ,poaching;disease; ,protected; ,2,1397,large desert marsupial-mouse; sandhill sminthopsis,Sminthopsis psammophila,Sandhill dunnart (Sminthopsis psammophila),Animalia,Chordata,Mammalia,Dasyuromorphia,Dasyuridae,Sminthopsis (1),Male weight: up to 55 g (2)Female weight: up to 42 g (2),The sandhill dunnart occupies a relatively small area and occurs at only six known locations (1). The likely extinction of the sandhill dunnart from the Northern Territory corresponds to a reduction of over 50 percent in its overall range (5) and its distribution populations and habitat are continuing to decline (1). There are now believed to be fewer than 2500 mature sandhill dunnarts left in the wild and over recent years its total population has decreased by over 20 percent (1).,The sandhill dunnart is listed as \xe2\x80\x98endangered\xe2\x80\x99 under the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 which provides a framework for the protection and management of Australian wildlife (5). This species is also listed on Appendix I of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) which bans any international trade in the sandhill dunnart (3). , ,cites;captive breeding; ,0,2398,Eulemur fulvus sanfordi,Eulemur sanfordi,Sanfordí¢ŒóŒ»s brown lemur (Eulemur sanfordi),Animalia,Chordata,Mammalia,Primates,Lemuridae,Eulemur (1),1.8 í¢ŒóŒñ 2 kg (3),Habitat destruction remains the primary threat to this lemur largely as a result of the explosive growth in the human population on Madagascar (2) (5).

However poaching and brush fires are fairly common events in many of Madagascar\xe2\x80\x99s nature reserves and protection needs to be increased. Only a handful of captive bred populations of this lemur exist around the world (5). The fate of this lemur will most probably be determined by the future of its forest habitat which needs to be better preserved if the survival of this species is to be safeguarded. ,hunting;pet; ,protected; ,2,1399,Nesionixalus thomensis,Hyperolius thomensis,Sao Tome giant treefrog (Hyperolius thomensis),Animalia,Chordata,Amphibia,Anura,Hyperoliidae,Hyperolius (1),Male length: 27 - 41 mm (2)Female length: 36 - 49 mm (2),Forest clearance began on S\xc3\xa3o Tom\xc3\xa9 in the late 15th century when early colonisers made space for the cultivation of sugar cane.

Ever since the Portuguese settled on the island in 1479 large areas of forest have been lost as land was converted for agriculture such as sugar coffee and cocoa plantations (2) (3). More recent deforestation is attributable to the construction of houses and gardens(1). Today it is largely the remote and inaccessible areas of forest that remain untouched (3).,As extremely little is known about this species there is a great need for studies to establish its abundance and distribution and to better understand the threats it faces (1).

This has been caused by introduced predatory fish primarily the smallmouth bass (<i>Micropterus dolomieu</i>) in addition to habitat degradation and fragmentation (2).  As the Olifants River region experiences hot dry summers water is extracted from the main river and its tributaries to irrigate the surrounding agricultural land.  Impoundments are also constructed to store water after the winter rainy season.  Furthermore river beds are bulldozed into wide channels to prevent the adjacent land from being flooded in the rainy season (2).  Such activities greatly alter the habitat of the sawfin and restrict its ability to move freely between different areas.,CapeNature a public institution responsible for biodiversity in the Western Cape (5) classifies the sawfin as endangered which makes it an offence to remove captured fish from rivers and dams.  CapeNature also undertakes regular surveys of the Olifants River system and has successfully cultured the sawfin since 1994.  Juveniles are then introduced to suitable natural habitats or stocked into farm dams to establish refuge populations.  Small parts of the sawfin\xe2\x80\x99s range fall within protected areas including the Cedarberg Matjies River and Oorlogskloof Nature Reserves (2).  However to ensure the sawfin\xe2\x80\x99s future it is vital to protect the habitat in the specific tributaries and the small section of the Olifants River mainstream where the sawfin remains abundant.

An intensive commercial fur trade from 1740 until about 1900 resulted in the sea otter being harvested almost to extinction and by 1900 the sea otter was so rare that commercial harvesting was forced to cease (6). Sea otters were protected by an international treaty in 1911. Since then numbers have recovered to an extent but human activities especially coastal development and marine pollution now pose a threat to the sea otter (6). In 1989 hundreds and possibly thousands of sea otters were killed as a direct result of the Exxon Valdez oil spill in Prince William Sound in Alaska (4). The possibility of another major oil spill poses a continual threat to the sea otter and could have devastating consequences. Additional threats include entanglement in fishing gear particularly gill nets and competition with commercial fisheries for food (6). In the central Aleutian Islands Alaska sea otters have declined by as much as 90 percent (4). Evidence indicates that this drastic decline is the result of increased predation by killer whales which have switched to consuming more sea otters following the collapse of Steller\xe2\x80\x99s sea lion and harbour seal populations in the region (4).,The sea otter is legally protected in the United States under the Marine Mammal Protection Act and in Canada sea otters are protected under the Species at Risk Act (10).

Land use changes have lead to the desiccation of its aquatic habitat on which it is dependent for reproduction and feeding. The scarcity of suitable habitats has lead to the range of the Semirechensk salamander becoming severely fragmented and populations becoming disjointed (1). Local fishing practices involving the diversion of streams have also resulted in reductions in certain populations of the Semirechensk salamander (1) (3).,The Semirechensk salamander is listed in the Red Data Books of the USSR and Kazakhstan and is listed as a protected species in the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region in China. Only part of the Semirechensk salamander\xe2\x80\x99s range is thought to fall within a protected area although its presence there is unconfirmed.

In addition predation by introduced species such as cats and brown rats (<i>Rattus norvegicus</i>) and competition with the introduced common myna (<i>Acridotheres tristis</i>) may have also been responsible for the dramatic decline in the magpie robin (2). At present the very low population size means that the species is extremely vulnerable both to chance events and to the problems associated with <strong>inbreeding</strong>.,Since 1990 Birdlife International has operated a Seychelles Magpie Robin Recovery Programme and the RSPB joined this effort in 1998 (6). Birds have been introduced to small predator-free islands and a predator eradication programme is being initiated on Fr\xc3\xa9gate Island (2). Breeding success has been boosted through a number of measures such as the creation of habitat and supplementary feeding and a genetic study is currently underway to investigate <strong>inbreeding</strong> (2).

Scops-owl territories at lower altitudes or outside protected areas are under threat from forest clearance for housing development and timber exploitation.  Ecotourism and the associated disturbance of luring the scops-owl into view by playing recordings of its call may also affect some populations (5).  Other potential threats include introduced predators such as cats rats and barn owls (2) although the impact they may have on the scops-owl is yet to be determined (5) (7).,The Seychelles scops owl is listed on Appendix II of the Convention of International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) which means that any trade in this species should be tightly controlled (3).  It is also protected by law in the Seychelles under the Wild Animals and Bird Protection Act (5).  A large proportion of the scops-owl\xe2\x80\x99s range lies within the Morne Seychellois National Park; the planned creation of a second protected area south of this National Park would result in approximately 80 percent of its range being protected from development and habitat loss and would greatly improve the species\xe2\x80\x99 protection (7).  A monitoring programme was set up in 1997 but as yet no information on population trends is available.  It is important that monitoring of the population continues long-term (7).  The first baseline survey of this species was conducted in 2000 and 2001 and resulted in the Seychelles scops-owl being downlisted from Critically Endangered to Endangered on the IUCN Red List in 2004 on the basis of population size (1) (7). ,loss; ,cites;protected; ,1,2412,Anthus sharpei,Macronyx sharpei,Sharpeí¢ŒóŒ»s longclaw (Macronyx sharpei),Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Motacillidae,Macronyx (1),Length: 16 í¢ŒóŒñ 17 cm (2),The specific habitat requirements of Sharpe\xe2\x80\x99s longclaw make it very sensitive to changes in grassland cover and quality (4). Since human settlement in 1964 the Kinangop Plateau has been primarily used for dairy farming which retains grassland as pasture but now landowners are showing a preference for crop-farming over livestock-farming. As a result grassland is being rapidly converted into cultivated land (5). Tussock grasslands now cover only about a quarter of the plateau and many of the patches are too small to support a population of Sharpe\xe2\x80\x99s longclaw. Increasing human populations will lead to further loss and fragmentation of grassland habitats and it is predicted that by 2010 tussock grasslands will have diminished to cover only about one-fifth of the plataeau (4).,The highland grasses of Kenya occur almost entirely on private land with no formal protection. The conservation of grassland is critical to the conservation of Sharpe\xe2\x80\x99s longclaw but it will only survive if the habitat is managed in a way that is in harmony with the needs of the landowners. With a preference for crop-farming over livestock farming landowner\xe2\x80\x99s interests seem incompatible with grassland conservation. However a survey in 1996 showed that a substantial proportion of landowners were prepared to consider opportunities to enhance the area\xe2\x80\x99s conservation value (5). A local conservation action group \xe2\x80\x98Friends of Kinangop Plateau\xe2\x80\x99 is campaigning for an initiative that encourages production of food crops from small gardens without having to convert large grassland areas (4). Improving milk processing facilities to make dairy farming more appealing and providing landowners with economic incentives to maintain grassland habitat are proposed measures that will help protect the Sharpe\xe2\x80\x99s longclaw and other species of Kenya\xe2\x80\x99s grasslands (3). ,loss;fragmentation; , ,2,0413,Tollo,Triakis acutipinna,Sharpfin houndshark (Triakis acutipinna),Animalia,Chordata,Chondrichthyes,Carcharhiniformes,Triakidae,Triakis (1),Maximum adult male length: 90 cm (2)Maximum adult female length: 102 cm (2),Small scale fisheries are common throughout Ecuador and sharks including hound sharks are often victims of <strong>bycatch</strong>.

Unmanaged recreational hunting is a major threat throughout its range and the rapid expansion of disturbance and intrusion caused by desert tourism based on 4x4 and other forms of motorised transport also affects some of the remaining populations in North Africa (7).,A small number of slender-horned gazelle are in captivity around the world. All are part of an international captive breeding programme but are derived from a very small initial founder group of original wild-caught Tunisian stock (7) (8). There are also very small captive groups held by national conservation institutions in Algeria and Tunisia.

The primary threat to this species is the persistent degradation of its habitat by introduced sheep. Sheep grazing has caused soil erosion and prevents the natural regeneration of the island\xe2\x80\x99s forests (6) (7). This has been most severe on the southern side of the island which is now largely treeless and supports very little birdlife (4). Consequently over the last 50 years the Socorro parakeet\xe2\x80\x99s habitat has contracted substantially. Predation by feral cats which were brought to the island in the 1950s is also a threat but at present it is unclear how significant this may be (4) (6) (7) (9).,The remote island of Socorro supports a unique diversity of birdlife including several <strong>endemic</strong> species and consequently is of high conservation importance (4). This island along with several others in the Revillagigedo chain was designated a biosphere reserve in 1994 and as a direct result of this several conservation measures have been implemented that aim to restore and preserve the island\xe2\x80\x99s landscape. Programmes have begun to remove sheep and feral cats from the island and should stimulate the regeneration of the forest whilst diminishing the threat of predation on the island\xe2\x80\x99s birds (6). The number of sheep on the island has already been successfully reduced to less than 300 with further culls planned (9) (10). Furthermore a nest-box provision programme for the Socorro parakeet has begun and a captive breeding programme has been established which will be used as a last ditch attempt to save the species if the natural population drops to critical levels (6) (10). , ,captive breeding; ,0,1425,Petit-duc d'Irí€ŒÂne,Otus ireneae,Sokoke scops-owl (Otus ireneae),Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Strigiformes,Strigidae,Otus (1),45 í¢ŒóŒñ 50 g (2),The Arabuko-Sokoke forest has been overexploited during recent years by commercial logging.  Commercial harvesting has not been regulated and coupled with rampant illegal exploitation has contributed to forest degradation and loss of biodiversity (5).  Within the Sokoke scops-owl\xe2\x80\x99s Tanzanian range the mountains support a high human population density which places enormous pressure on the land for subsistence agriculture.  In the past mechanical harvesting of timber caused much environmental damage but that has now stopped and today most timber is extracted using pit-sawing techniques where professional sawyers cut trees into planks on site and walk out the forest with sawn timber.  Whilst this is much less damaging almost all of this harvesting is illegal.  In addition firewood harvesting is extensive throughout the mountains and is particularly hard to regulate (6).  The harvesting of particular tree species is likely to have a great impact on the Sokoke scops-owl as <i>Brachylaena</i> trees provide essential nesting sites and <i>Cynometra</i> trees are important areas for roosting and foraging (4).,The Sokoke scops-owl is listed on Appendix II of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) which means that any trade in this species should be carefully regulated (3).  It has been the focus of a number of surveys (4) (7) and there are also measures in place in both parts of its range to conserve critical habitat.  The Arabuko-Sokoke forest was established as a reserve in 1943 and contains two nature reserves within it (8).  The Arabuko-Sokoke Forest Management Team has developed a Strategic Forest Management Plan which aims to have an intact and fully functioning forest ecosystem with no reduction in the existing forest area by 2027 (5).  In the East Usambaras the Tanzania Forest Conservation Group has been promoting conservation since 1993.  The project has assisted villagers to plant over one million trees establish three village forest reserves and have a greater understanding of forest conservation (9). ,loss;environmental;environment; ,cites; ,3,1426,Albatros brun,Phoebetria fusca,Sooty albatross (Phoebetria fusca),Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Procellariiformes,Diomedeidae,Phoebetria (1),Head-body length: 84 í¢ŒóŒñ 89 cm (2)Wingspan: 203 cm (2)Male weight: 2.7 kg (2)Female weight: 2.4 kg (2),Introduced rats are known to consume albatross eggs and the sooty albatross is thought to be vulnerable to avian cholera and the erysipelas bacteria (2) (6).

There has been widespread clearance of Bolivia\xe2\x80\x99s forests within this bird\xe2\x80\x99s altitudinal range for the cultivation of staple and export crops (2) such as coca and citrus fruits (7). Rural development road-building and hunting are also thought to have dramatically impacted the survival of this rare bird. In Peru oil exploration poses a threat to the species\xe2\x80\x99 habitat in addition to opening up the foothills to human colonisation and hunting (2).,Fortunately large parts of the southern helmeted curassow\xe2\x80\x99s current range are protected by Ambor\xc3\xb3 and Carrasco National Parks (2). A number of extensive surveys have been conducted in recent years (2) and continue with the hope that the information gained will help inform a long-term conservation programme (8). Sadly most surveys have met with little success in locating the species in many of the searched areas (2). However surveys conducted by a team from Asociacion Armon\xc3\xada (BirdLife in Bolivia) resulted in the remarkable rediscovery of the subspecies <i>C. u. koepckeae</i> in Peru in 2005 being the first observation of this bird in 36 years. This work has subsequently been followed up with an environmental awareness project involving educating local people about their unique bird and distributing T-shirts and notebooks that depict the curassow along with words that inspire pride in the local fauna and emphasise the need to preserve it (4). The project appears to have had some success with reports that there is a genuine enthusiasm amongst local people to protect their <strong>endemic</strong> bird now that they appreciated its global significance (4) which is a positive first step towards safeguarding its long-term survival. ,hunting; ,protected; ,1,1429,southern woolly spider monkey; woolly spider monkey,Brachyteles arachnoides,Southern muriqui (Brachyteles arachnoides),Animalia,Chordata,Mammalia,Primates,Atelidae,Brachyteles (1),Male head-body length: 55 í¢ŒóŒñ 78 cm (2)Female head-body length: 46 í¢ŒóŒñ 63 cm (2)Male tail length: 74 í¢ŒóŒñ 80 cm (2)Female tail length: 65 í¢ŒóŒñ 74 cm (2)Male weight: 12 í¢ŒóŒñ 15 kg (2)Female weight: 9.5 í¢ŒóŒñ 11 kg (2),The muriqui was once widespread in the Atlantic Forest Region but today the southern species is thought to number just under 1000 individuals (4).

Historically the species was hunted for its highly priced fur and despite hunting now being illegal enforcement is often poor and illegal poaching is common (1) (3). Habitat loss and degradation also continue to be major threats as a result of dam construction the removal of vegetation along riverbanks river and stream canalisation drainage for agriculture and water pollution (1) (3) (5). Large-scale deforestation has also indirectly affected freshwater habitats causing severe flooding and the deposition of soil on river beds (1). There has also been some concern that the southern river otter may face competition from the introduced American mink <em>Mustela vison</em> although this is now believed to be less likely than previously feared (1) (3).,International trade in the southern river otter is banned under its listing on Appendix I of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) (4) and the species is also listed on Appendix I of the Convention on Migratory Species (CMS) (6).

Wild populations are thought to be plummeting particularly in Indonesia where they are considered Critically Endangered and known trade volumes have recently declined by about 50 %. Elsewhere the species is restricted to small and isolated populations over much of its range (1). When they reach the West and enter the pet market imported Asian turtles are often parasite ridden and mortality is relatively high (4) (8). Many have also had to endure poor and incredibly stressful conditions in food markets and are dehydrated and malnourished from their long journeys from the Asian food markets to the Western pet trade (8). Unfortunately the extreme difficulty in breeding this species in captivity means that all specimens found in pet stores today are still caught from the wild and freshly imported from Asia.,Like many other species the spiny turtle would benefit from captive breeding programmes or \xe2\x80\x98turtle farms\xe2\x80\x99 to supply the food and pet market and thereby mitigate the demand to remove large numbers from the wild (4). Unfortunately this species is notoriously difficult to breed in captivity and only a handful of institutions have ever successfully bred the species including Zoo Atlanta and Knoxville Zoo in the US. and Durell Wildlife in Jersey Europe (9) (11). Nevertheless these few successes provide fresh hope that a captive breeding programme might one day be able to haul the species back from the brink of extinction (12). It is also hoped that these successful reproductive attempts will help provide more information about the biology and ecology of this beautiful yet complex species information that can prove invaluable for conservation action in the wild (11) (12). ,pet; ,captive breeding; ,1,1437,Fischerí¢ŒóŒ»s ground-thrush,Zoothera guttata,Spotted ground-thrush (Zoothera guttata),Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Turdidae,Zoothera (1),45 - 78 g (2),The destruction of spotted ground-thrush habitat has meant that the small and severely fragmented populations are in decline (4).

Montane forests have been extensively cleared for conversion to timber plantations and agriculture firewood collection particularly around Nuwara Eliya Maskeliya and Bogowantaalaw and gem mining. Even some \xe2\x80\x98protected forests\xe2\x80\x99 are unable to escape these threats and continue to be degraded and fragmented. In particular the replacement of natural mixed forests containing fruiting trees with single-species plantations has badly affected this bird by reducing its available food supply. In addition streams within this species\xe2\x80\x99 range are becoming polluted with run-off chemicals such as insecticides and pesticides from nearby vegetable farms almost certainly harming stream-dependent birds such as the Sri Lanka Whistling-thrush. It has also been speculated that mountain forest die-back may be the result of acid clouds rain and mist caused by air-pollution (3) (4).,The Sri Lanka whistling thrush is legally protected in Sri Lanka and occurs in several national parks and forest reserves most notably Peak Wilderness Sanctuary and Hakgala Strict Nature Reserve (3) (4).

Excessive harvesting of fruit is just one explanation along with increased predation by burgeoning wild pig and rat populations and the absence of seed dispersal agents for the lack of regeneration at all but one locality (2) (5). Unfortunately all the localities where the Suarez baobab is found are being rapidly degraded by deforestation for timber firewood and charcoal including the only remaining regenerating population which is under increasing threat from a growing mining town (5).,Despite being one of the most endangered of Madagascan baobabs the Suarez baobab is the only species that is not protected within a reserve (5). In recent years the Madagascan government has pledged to triple the size of protected areas within the country including increasing the amount of forest under protection by five million hectares (6).

Of the remaining forested habitat only 5% contains potentially suitable foraging habitat for this species (5). In addition swift parrots suffer high mortality through collision with windows vehicles and fences. The total swift parrot population is estimated to be no more than 1000 pairs. At best it is stable but given the current mortality rates and habitat destruction it is more likely to be declining (5).,As this species is such as specialist in both its winter habitat and foraging requirements the survival of the swift parrot will depend on the protection of remaining areas of eucalypt species and the protection of all breeding and foraging sites in Tasmania (6). The Swift Parrot Recovery Plan 2001 - 2005 is addressing these priorities and is planning to reduce this species\xe2\x80\x99 conservation status from endangered to vulnerable within the next 10 years (5). , , ,0,0443,Porphyrio mantelli,Porphyrio hochstetteri,Takahe (Porphyrio hochstetteri),Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Gruiformes,Rallidae,Porphyrio (1),Female weight: 2.3 kg (2)Male weight: 2.7 kg (2)Length: 63 cm (2),When Europeans arrived in New Zealand the pressures on New Zealand's previously isolated and mammal-free fauna and flora intensified.

Much of Sri Lanka\xe2\x80\x99s original tropical moist montane forest has been cleared during the last two centuries for cinchona coffee tea rubber and cardamom plantations for grazing livestock by logging companies illegal logging and removal of timber by peripheral villagers (5) (8). The montane forests of the Knuckles Mountains where this species is found have been particularly affected by cardamom cultivation which requires that much of the forest understorey is cleared and although the canopy is retained for shade continuing weeding of the area to remove competing vegetation prevents natural regeneration of the forest. Some areas are also still cultivated for vegetables using traditional slash and burn techniques and on occasion this can lead to out-of-control forest fires (6). With a rapidly growing population and increasing demand for agricultural land the destruction of montane forests continues at an alarming rate. Further more there is intensive use of pesticides on vegetable cultivations and tea plantations in Sri Lanka which could be having a serious polluting affect. Although the impact these chemicals are having on non-target species is not yet known studies elsewhere indicate that they could potentially be devastating with possibilities for <strong>bioaccumulation</strong>. There is also evidence in the tropical moist montane forests of the Knuckles Mountains of large-scale forest die-back thought to be the result of acid rain and these forests are considered particularly at risk from climate change especially global warming (5).,Project Knuckles 2004 and a follow-up expedition in 2005 were initiated to conduct the first in-depth study of reptiles and the primary threats facing them in the Knuckles Mountain Range (6). It was discovered that the region held some of the highest reptile diversity in the country and is therefore an important site for conservation. Tennent\xe2\x80\x99s leaf-nosed lizard was one of three target species studied (9). As of 2000 areas above 1067 m above sea level were given protected status as conservation forest. As such cardamom cultivation has had to be abandoned in the area. However rather than allowing the natural regeneration of native forest the cardamom appears to have been replaced by a series of invasive weeds such as mistflower (<i>Eupatorium riparium</i>) and Lantana (<i>Lantana camara</i>) (6). Fortunately Tennent\xe2\x80\x99s leaf-nosed lizards appear to be fairly adaptable and tolerant of some degree of habitat disturbance having been recorded from forests under planted with cardamom and pine plantations providing hope for the long-term survival of this unique unusual looking reptile (3) (6). ,loss;fragmentation;pet; ,protected; ,3,1451,Cotorra-serrana Occidental; Loro Piquigordo; Periquito de Pico Grueso,Rhynchopsitta pachyrhyncha,Thick-billed parrot (Rhynchopsitta pachyrhyncha),Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Psittaciformes,Psittacidae,Rhynchopsitta (1),Length: 38 cm (2),The population of the thick-billed parrot has been reduced to worryingly low numbers and the species has been lost from much of its former range. The major habitat of this species old growth conifer forests has been extensively logged throughout the region with devastating consequences (2). The illegal pet trade has also targeted these attractive parrots (5).,International trade is prohibited by the listing of the thick-billed parrot on Appendix I of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) (3).

It is hunted for its scales which are believed by some to have so-called medicinal and aphrodisiac properties; for its leathery skin which is used to make goods such as boots and shoes; and for its meat (1) (5).,The thick-tailed pangolin is listed on Appendix II of the Convention on the International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) (3) and in 2000 the CITES authority passed a zero export quota which prevents the commercial trade in this species (1). It is also protected by wildlife laws in Bangladesh India Pakistan and Sri Lanka (1) although as hunting remains the primary threat to this species it is clear that such laws are not enforced as strongly as they need to be.

One area in which this may not be true is the Mulanje Mountain Forest Reserve.  This reserve the stronghold of the population in Malawi is the focus of a programme that provides long-term support for research and conservation measures (3) (5).  The declining forest of Mount Namuli is currently unprotected although in 2008 efforts were underway to protect some of this habitat (3).  It is clear that the focus of conservation measures for this Endangered bird should be the preservation of the remaining fragments of evergreen forest.

Indeed unless the determinants of this decline are accurately identified and appropriately dealt with the future of this species cannot be safeguarded. ,disease;pollution; , ,2,0461,brook chub,Squalius lucumonis,Toscana stream chub (Squalius lucumonis),Animalia,Chordata,Actinopterygii,Cypriniformes,Cyprinidae,Squalius (1),Length: 16 cm (2),Occurring in just 10 to 12 isolated populations the Toscana stream chub has an extremely fragmented distribution within its restricted range (1) (3). Each of these populations is under threat from habitat change due to water extraction and pollution to which this species is extremely sensitive.

Kakamega and South Nandi Forests in Kenya are threatened by the encroachment of agriculture (both cultivation and cattle-grazing) uncontrolled logging and charcoal-making (3). South Nandi Forest in particular is being impacted by commercial logging; not only is it undertaken in a destructive manner but it is targeting <i>Croton megalocarpus</i> a preferred tree of the Turner\xe2\x80\x99s eremomela (3). In the Democratic Republic of Congo and Uganda the Turner\xe2\x80\x99s eremomela is considered rare but little else is known about its status (2).,The northern part of Kakamega Forest has been declared a national park and another small area of the forest has been set aside as a national reserve (2) measures which will offer some protection to the habitat of the Turner\xe2\x80\x99s eremomela\xe2\x80\x99s. A group of local guides in Kakamega Forest have also initiated a programme of environmental education and awareness activities. However effective conservation of both Kakamega and South Nandi Forests are still lacking and commercial logging continues despite a ban on the logging of indigenous trees in Kenya (3). Major conservation projects are required to ensure the protection of these forests in Kenya including enforcing the ban on logging indigenous trees which will help secure the eremomela\xe2\x80\x99s future (3). , , ,0,0463,cylindrical skink,Chalcides mauritanicus,Two-fingered skink (Chalcides mauritanicus),Animalia,Chordata,Reptilia,Squamata,Scincidae,Chalcides (1),Length: 6 - 8 cm (2),The two-fingered skink occupies a restricted and fragmented range and is under threat from a decline in the extent and quality of its habitat (1).

The introduction of the black rat (<i>Rattus rattus</i>) by sea vessels to Nuku Hiva around 1915 Ua Pou around 1980 and Fatu Hiva in 2000 (2) contributed to the swift extinction of each island\xe2\x80\x99s ultramarine lorikeet population. The <strong>arboreal</strong> rats inhabit hollows in trees and are easily able to access this species\xe2\x80\x99 nests and consume its eggs (4).,There have been several conservation initiatives proposed and implemented for this species. In the 1990s a small number of ultramarine lorikeets were <strong>translocated</strong> to Fatu Hiva where until the black rat\xe2\x80\x99s introduction in 2000 they had formed a successful growing population. Sadly measures to protect this species from the rats proved unsuccessful and by 2007 Fatu Hiva\xe2\x80\x99s ultramarine lorikeet population was considered extinct.

Within these reserves all forest clearance fragrant oil production rattan and palm leaf collection should be prohibited. Surveys between 1988 and 1994 contributed to the drawing up of a management plan for the Ke Go Nature Reserve which was published in 1996.

Indeed a survey in 1991 found that the species had already become extinct in over 95 percent of its former range largely as a result of intensive hunting and extensive deforestation (4) with land having been cleared for agriculture and logging operations at a frightening pace (5). Hunting also poses a significant threat to this Endangered deer (5).,The Visayan spotted deer is afforded some degree of protection through its occurrence in Mt. Camlaon National Park North Negros Forest Reserve Mount Talinis/Lake Balinsasayao Reserve and the proposed West Panay Mountains National Park (5). Although Visayan spotted deer are legally protected their distribution in remote dense inland forest makes the practicalities of guard patrolling very difficult and hunting therefore continues (3). In 1990 the Philippine Spotted Deer Conservation Program was set up to initiate a captive breeding programme and a number of other conservation measures including a public education campaign and an annual series of conservation workshops (4) (5). Visayan spotted deer are currently held in captivity in Mari-it Conservation Centre in Panay two breeding centres in Negros and a dozen zoos in Europe (7). ,hunting; ,captive breeding;protected; ,1,2474,Panay tarictic hornbill; tarictic hornbill,Penelopides panini,Visayan tarictic (Penelopides panini),Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Coraciiformes,Bucerotidae,Penelopides (1),Length: 45 cm (2),The forests of all the Philippine Islands from where the Visayan tarictic is known have been heavily deforested with forest cover being reduced by at least 70 percent on all the islands and Masbate Guimaras Sicogon and Pan de Azucar being almost completely deforested (2).  Such rampant destruction is almost certainly having a serious impact on the species and it may already have been exterminated from some islands.  Hunting for subsistence trade and sport has also devastated populations on some islands and it is now possibly extinct on Sicogon as a result (6).  Extensive hunting and trapping of the Visayan tarictic continues unchecked in many areas (6).,The Visayan tarictic is listed on Appendix II of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) which means that trade in this species should be carefully controlled (3).  This endangered bird also occurs in the protected areas of the North Negros Forest Reserve and Mount Canlaon Natural Park although the first only receives nominal protection and the status of Mount Canlaon has not prevented the total clearance of the lower slopes (10) (11).   On Panay the declaration of the North-Western Panay Peninsula forest as a protected area affords some protection to the Visayan tarictics breeding there (12) and the Central Panay Mountains National Park has been proposed which would encompass the majority of the island\xe2\x80\x99s Visayan tarictic population (11).  The proper protection of all these sites is an extremely important measure required for the survival of the Visayan tarictic.  The Philippine Endemic Species Conservation Project (PESCP) operates a nest protection programme for the Visayan wrinkled hornbill (<i>Aceros waldeni</i>) in north and north-west Panay which also benefits the Visayan tarictic.  Hunting and trapping of the tarictic in those areas has virtually ceased due to the monitoring and confiscations undertaken by PESCP (12).  Mount Talinis and Mount Canlaon have also been the target of conservation awareness campaigns which has reduced local hunting pressure (6) (11). ,hunting; ,cites;protected; ,1,2475,Teporingo; Zacatuche,Romerolagus diazi,Volcano rabbit (Romerolagus diazi),Animalia,Chordata,Mammalia,Lagomorpha,Leporidae,Romerolagus (1),400 í¢ŒóŒñ 500 g (2),This scarce little-known rabbit has recently disappeared from many areas in central Mexico where it had previously been reported largely as a result of habitat destruction and hunting for sport which continue to pose an ever-present threat (1) (6). Habitat has been destroyed and degraded by intentional fires overgrazing by cattle and sheep over-exploitation of pine for timber encroaching agriculture and property developments and cutting of grasses for thatch and brush manufacture (1) (6). Nearly all fires are started by humans often originating from people burning zacaton to promote new growth of pasture for cattle and sheep (6).,Hunting of the volcano rabbit is now illegal under Mexican law but enforcement remains difficult. The species is found within two protected areas Izta-Popo and Zoquiapan National Parks but habitat destruction nevertheless continues to occur even within these areas (1) (6). In 1990 the World Conservation Union Species Survival Commission (IUCN/SSC) Lagomorph Specialist Group created an action plan for this rabbit focusing on the need to manage burning and overgrazing and to enforce laws prohibiting the capture sale and hunting of the animal (6). As a result the population of volcano rabbits is higher now than a decade ago (7). Captive breeding colonies exist at Los Coyotes Park and the Chapultepec Zoo in Mexico City but there are currently no plans to reintroduce captive-bred individuals into the wild (6) (7). ,hunting; ,captive breeding;protected; ,1,2476,Capra ibex walie,Capra walie,Walia ibex (Capra walie),Animalia,Chordata,Mammalia,Cetartiodactyla,Bovidae,Capra (1),80 - 125 kg (2),Its inaccessible habitat afforded a degree of protection to the walia ibex until the arrival of modern firearms after which the population rapidly declined. Subsequently this ibex has suffered extensive hunting by local people for its meat hides and horns (2). The horns have been used by local people to make drinking mugs and also as trophies by sportsmen to decorate their homes (3). Additionally important habitat has been threatened by encroaching settlement livestock grazing and cultivation (6). Road construction is fragmenting habitat and facilitating traffic which increases the chance of erosion and noise disturbance (7). In 1963 it was estimated that between just 150 and 200 individuals remained (3) but with the creation of the Semien National Park around 1969 poaching appeared to be brought under control (2). The species is now reported to number over 500 and to be on the increase (6). A major conservation problem remaining however is that the natural habitat left is extremely limited (2).,In 1969 the Semien National Park was established to protect the habitat and the endangered wildlife it sustained and the walia ibex became a \xe2\x80\x98flagship\xe2\x80\x99 species for the area (1). The park was also placed on the World Heritage List in 1978 (7). Guards were appointed from Geech to Mietgogo to curb local poaching and illegal cultivation and burning of habitat resulting in a steady increase in numbers in the past fifteen years (3). It can be difficult to enforce the current protection laws (3) and human encroachment continues but a recent report suggests that hunting now seems to be almost non-existent (7). It appears therefore that the presence of park scouts is having some success in this respect since local attitudes do not seem to have changed to demonstrate awareness or concern for the plight of these animals (7). Propagating a greater awareness and understanding of the grave position of the magnificent walia ibex both amongst the local communities and government officials is therefore an important focus for future conservation efforts in the battle to save this Endangered species (3) (7). ,hunting;poaching; ,protection law; ,2,1477,Yarellí¢ŒóŒ»s curassow,Crax globulosa,Wattled curassow (Crax globulosa),Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Galliformes,Cracidae,Crax (1),Length: 82 - 89Œæcm (2),Sadly the areas surrounding the Amazonian rivers to which this species is restricted are precisely those most useful and accessible to humans with the rivers providing good transport links (2) (6). Thus these areas have undergone considerable human colonisation development and exploitation with local settlements fragmenting critical curassow habitat (7). Additionally commercial and subsistence hunting is higher in these areas because of the easy access via the rivers and hunting is the primary cause of decline for this species (2) (7). In particular the replacement of traditional hunting practices with shotguns had a dramatic impact and the wattled curassow population plummeted (6). During the 1960s this unusual and distinctive looking bird was heavily hunted for subsistence by fur traders on the r\xc3\xado Beni in Bolivia but the prohibition of fur-hunting by CITES in 1971 thankfully reduced this threat (2).,The wattled curassow is afforded some degree of protection in the Mamirau\xc3\xa1 Sustainable Development Reserve in Brazil although it nevertheless continues to be hunted there and Pacaya-Samiria National Reserve in Peru. A temporary hunting ban has been implemented in Bolivia in order to secure the future of local hunting stocks by allowing the population to recover and this has reportedly had some success (2). It has been proposed that governments and nature reserves develop and help encourage ecotourism as an alternative means of income and subsistence for local people and as a source of sustainable development for the country (2) (6). To this end Asociaci\xc3\xb3n Armon\xc3\xada the BirdLife International partner in Bolivia is channelling funds into the development of a small scale ecotourism project in San Marcos in Bolivia where the only remaining population of wattled curassows in the country is found (8) (9). Asociaci\xc3\xb3n Armon\xc3\xada has worked closely in conjunction with the local community of San Marcos to ensure that vital Bolivian populations are preserved (8). The area around this species has been petitioned as an \xe2\x80\x98indigenous territory\xe2\x80\x99 and there is now a boat to the area for tourism with plans for a lodge and trained guides cooks etc. by 2007 (9).

As people expand their agricultural activities into forests establish tea gardens and coffee estates undertake logging and carry out other development projects forest habitat is steadily fragmented and reduced. When forests are fragmented the gibbon must spend more time on the ground moving between forest patches; at these moments it becomes extremely vulnerable to both domestic and wild dogs (7). Adding to the threat of habitat loss is the pressure of hunting with people hunting this charismatic primate for food traditional medicine and the pet trade; unfortunately the gibbon\xe2\x80\x99s beautiful songs act as a signal that guides hunters directly to them (7).,Ironically while humans have pushed the western hoolock gibbon into its precarious situation this species is now entirely dependent on human action for its survival (8). The western hoolock gibbon occurs in numerous protected areas throughout its range (1) is listed on Schedule I of the Indian Wildlife (Protection) Act of 1972 (1) (9) and organisations are working together to carry out many other conservation actions (10).

Road kills may pose a significant threat particularly during the breeding season when the toads migrate to the breeding sites (1) (2) and urban development can also increase the physical barriers to such movements (2). In addition artificial water bodies with vertical sides such as swimming pools and stormwater drains can present death traps to toads while further threats at some breeding sites include pollution and introduced species such as predatory fish invasive plants and captive ducks which can consume eggs and tadpoles. The replacement of lawns and flowerbeds with stone and paving may also be reducing available foraging habitat (2) and there is increasing concern that the introduced guttural toad <i>Amietophrynus gutturalis</i> may compete with the western leopard toad for food and resources (8). An isolated population in the east of the range appears to be most under threat despite occurring in the least urbanised habitat (9).,The western leopard toad is legally protected within South Africa (2) and also occurs in some protected areas such as the Agulhas National Park and in the northern parts of Cape of Good Hope Nature Reserve. However most of its habitat occurs outside of reserves and is unprotected (1) (2).

In 2007 the Western Leopard Toad Conservation Committee (WLT-CC) was formed and are helping to draft a Biodiversity Management Plan for the species (2) (9). Volunteers help rescue toads from roads during the breeding season and photographs sent in by the public are being used to monitor the toad population identifying individuals by their unique markings (2) (5). Genetic studies radio-tracking and monitoring of the invasive guttural toad are also underway (2) (5) (8) and local residents have been given advice on making swimming pools safer for toads (2). By raising awareness of urban conservation issues and promoting more \xe2\x80\x98ecofriendly\xe2\x80\x99 gardening practices the conservation of this beautiful amphibian is also likely to benefit a range of other wildlife in the Cape Province (2). ,invasive;pet;pollution; ,protected; ,3,1483,bay colobus; Miss Waldroní¢ŒóŒ»s bay colobus; Miss Waldroní¢ŒóŒ»s red colobus; red colobus; Temminckí¢ŒóŒ»s bay colobus; Temminckí¢ŒóŒ»s red colobus; Upper Guinea bay colobus; Upper Guinea red colobus; West African red colobus,Procolobus badius,Western red colobus (Procolobus badius),Animalia,Chordata,Mammalia,Primates,Cercopithecidae,Procolobus (1),5.1 - 11.3 kg (2),One of the main causes of the decline in the western red colobus is hunting especially in the eastern parts of its range. This species has been heavily impacted by both subsistence and commercial hunting with the bay colobus (<em>P. b. badius</em>) and Miss Waldron\xe2\x80\x99s red colobus (<em>P. b. waldroni</em>) particularly at risk (1). Hunting pressure is believed to have caused the possible extinction of Miss Waldron\xe2\x80\x99s red colobus (8).,The western red colobus is listed on Appendix II of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) meaning that any international trade in this species should be carefully regulated (3). It is also listed as a Class B species under the African Convention on the Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources which means it should only be legally captured or killed with special authorisation (9). The western red colobus occurs in a number of protected areas throughout its range (1). ,loss;hunting; ,cites;protected; ,2,2484,Lorenz von Liburnauí¢ŒóŒ»s woolly lemur; western Avahi,Avahi occidentalis,Western woolly lemur (Avahi occidentalis),Animalia,Chordata,Mammalia,Primates,Indriidae,Avahi (1),700 í¢ŒóŒñ 900 g (2),15 species of lemur have become extinct since sea-faring humans arrived on Madagascar\xe2\x80\x99s shores around 2000 years ago and humanity is still wreaking ecological destruction on the island (7). Habitat destruction through forest felling and burning poses the principle threat to the biodiversity on Madagascar including the western woolly lemur (2). Small-scale but widespread clearing of forests is conducted for firewood cattle grazing charcoal production and construction materials. In the dry season people often set brush fires to clear pasture for cattle but the fires frequently burn out of control and threaten protected areas (8). Hunting also occurs in some regions. These factors coupled with the species\xe2\x80\x99 restricted range give cause for concern (2).,The western woolly lemur is confirmed in only two protected areas Ankarafantsika Nature Reserve and Manongarivo Special Reserve although this species has also been reported in Ankarana Special Reserve (2) (4). It has so far been impossible to keep western woolly monkeys in captivity probably because of their highly selective <strong>folivorous</strong> diet. It appears therefore that conservation of forests in situ where this species occurs is the best viable option of protecting the western woolly lemur (6). ,hunting; ,protected; ,1,1485,African white-backed vulture,Gyps africanus,White-backed vulture (Gyps africanus),Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Falconiformes,Accipitridae,Gyps (1),4150 í¢ŒóŒñ 7200 g (2),The white-backed vulture has been impacted by a number of threats resulting in a decline in numbers in recent years. Consequently in 2012 the IUCN Red List uplisted the species from Near Threatened to Endangered (1). These population declines have been caused by a combination of factors: the loss and conversion of the vulture\xe2\x80\x99s habitat for agriculture declines in wild <strong>ungulate</strong> populations reducing the availability of <strong>carrion</strong> hunting for use in traditional medicine capture for the illegal live trade (7) electrocution on electricity pylons drowning in farm reservoirs (8) persecution and poisoning (7).,A number of protected areas in Africa hold populations of white-backed vultures including Serengeti National Park in Tanzania a World Heritage Site (9). Yet the recent declines are worrying and further action is clearly required. Recommended measures include establishing legal protection for the species in all range countries establishing a vulture monitoring network and determining the most significant threats and seeking solutions (7). ,loss;hunting; ,protected; ,2,1486,long-haired spider monkey; white-fronted spider monkey,Ateles belzebuth,White-bellied spider monkey (Ateles belzebuth),Animalia,Chordata,Mammalia,Primates,Atelidae,Ateles (1),Female head-body length: 34 - 58 cm (2)Male head-body length: 42 - 50 cm (2)Female tail length: 61 - 88 cm (2)Male tail length: 69.5 - 82 cm (2)Female weight: 7.5 - 10.4 kg (2)Male weight: 7.3 - 9.8 kg (2),The most serious threats facing this spider monkey are hunting and deforestation for agriculture and for logging (1).,The white-bellied spider monkey occurs in a number of protected areas in Colombia (La Macarena Tinigua and Picachos) but there has been extensive human colonisation around these parks and so there is a need for hunting to be controlled in these areas. Unfortunately the presence of insurgents in some areas complicates park management (6). There is a substantial subpopulation of this species in Colombia between the Rios Caguan and Yari.

In some areas hunting has also been reported (2). These threats coupled with the lemur\xe2\x80\x99s very limited range give cause for considerable concern (2). Thus the white-collared brown lemur is listed as one of the world\xe2\x80\x99s 25 most endangered primates (6).,Currently this lemur is found in two protected areas: Manombo Special Reserve and Andringitra National Park (6) although there is further concern here as the Andringitra population hybridizes with <i>Eulemur rufus</i> (5) (6). Recent surveys have also identified populations in unprotected forests such as Vevembe that could be added to existing parks and reserves (4). However the white-collared brown lemur currently remains Endangered and its fate will most probably be determined by the future of its diminishing forest habitat which needs to be better preserved if extinction of this animal is to be prevented. ,hunting; ,protected; ,1,1489,lar gibbon,Hylobates lar,White-handed gibbon (Hylobates lar),Animalia,Chordata,Mammalia,Primates,Hylobatidae,Hylobates (1),Head-body length: 45-50 cm (2)Male weight: c. 5.7 kg (3)Female weight: c.5.3 kg (3),Rapid loss of habitat poses the principle threat to gibbons placing their future in great peril (3) (8).

The world population lies between 7910 to 13110 birds (2). At present the main threat to the Spanish population is its <strong>interbreeding</strong> with non-native North American ruddy ducks <i>Oxyura jamaicensis</i> which were brought to the UK in 1930s for captive wildfowl collections (8). Some young ruddy ducks escaped from captivity in 1952 and began to breed in the wild. The hybrids produced are fertile and therefore pose an increasing threat to the white-headed duck. The expansion of the ruddy duck could also threaten populations of white-headed duck across Asia (9). Evidence strongly suggests that UK birds are responsible for the ruddy duck's spread across Europe (10).,Ruddy duck populations are currently controlled in Spain Portugal and France. In the UK where the spread of the ruddy duck is believed to have originated the Government conducted a control trial that proved it is possible to eradicate the ruddy duck (11). <strong>Re-introduction</strong> schemes have also been conducted in Spain France and Italy to boost this species\xe2\x80\x99 numbers. There is hope for the recovery of the white-headed duck not least because of Spain\xe2\x80\x99s conservation achievement. In the 1970s there were only 22 individuals prompting dedicated conservation projects in Spain. These were hugely successful and there are now around 2500 ducks in Spain (12). It is hoped that other countries can follow Spain\xe2\x80\x99s success to protect the white-headed duck. In 1996 a European Action Plan was published to unite Europe\xe2\x80\x99s bird conservation groups and save the white-headed duck from extinction (5). ,loss;hunting;fishing;pollution; , ,4,0492,Red-nosed bearded saki; red-nosed saki; white-nosed bearded saki,Chiropotes albinasus,White-nosed saki (Chiropotes albinasus),Animalia,Chordata,Mammalia,Primates,Pitheciidae,Chiropotes (1),Male head-body length: c. 42.7 cm (2)Female head-body length: c. 41.8 cm (2)Tail length: 30 - 50.7 cm (3),The white-nosed saki is mainly threatened by habitat destruction as its range has been divided by the Trans-Amazon highway.

Its range also includes two reserves: the Parque Nacional da Amaz\xc3\xb4nia and Floresta Nacional do Tapaj\xc3\xb3s which offer this species some protection (1).

Shooting for food by early settlers and specimen collection for museums and egg collectors wreaked havoc on the remaining population. Today cranes remain at risk from human development (10); collisions with power-lines are now a serious cause of mortality (6). Moreover the single population is at risk from any chance event and conservationists are particularly fearful of a chemical spill in the Gulf of Mexico that would destroy the wintering grounds in Texas (6).,"The whooping crane has been the subject of an enormous broad-based conservation effort since the mid-20th Century involving the United States and Canadian Wildlife Services together with other organizations such as the Patuxent Wildlife Research Center and the International Crane Foundation (7). The multi-faceted approach has involved the protection of important habitats the monitoring of populations and a captive breeding program. The establishment of an additional migratory population was attempted in Idaho but has not proven successful (10). However greater progress has been achieved with the setting up of a non-migratory population in Florida which now numbers 86 individuals (11). Another attempt at establishing a migratory population was begun in 2001 with birds being taught a migration route from Wisconsin to Florida behind ultra-light aircraft (9). The main captive populations exist at Patuxent Wildlife Research Centre the International Crane Foundation and Calgary Zoo and have been used in these reintroduction attempts (10).

Under the Australian Protected Areas Programme a 132566 hectare area has been established to protect species including the woma python (6). It is important to provide incentives for landowners in this area to reduce the impact of current land use practises on this species (2).

Egg predation by skunks raccoons and opossums is becoming a serious problem due to an increase in the number of these scavengers since human settlement with egg and hatchling mortality exceeding 80 percent in some areas (6) (10). In the last few decades commercial poachers have mercilessly exploited this turtle for the pet trade range-wide and remain the primary threat to the species in a number of areas (6) (8). Significant numbers are also lost from road mortality shooting of basking turtles by vandals and incidental collection by recreationists (8). Indeed two wood turtle populations in areas of Connecticut previously closed to the public declined to virtual extinction within a decade of being exposed to human recreationists (3) (8). Because these turtles have a late onset of sexual maturity and a slow reproductive rate but a long lifespan they depend upon a long adult reproductive span to sustain population levels. Removal of just a few individuals thus has a dramatic impact and can easily lead to local extinction (3).,The wood turtle is legally protected to varying degrees by all the states and provinces where it lives and is totally protected from commercial collection and trade (5) (8). Like many endangered turtle species captive breeding may be the solution to satisfying the commercial demand for the wood turtle. Unfortunately this has led to many reptile breeders scrambling to obtain specimens while they still can (11).

Wax palms on which this species appears to rely so heavily have become endangered. For centuries Colombian Christians have used wax palm fronds for Palm Sunday processions and peasants fell the wax palms just to strip the highly prized young emerging fronds for sale to worshippers (6). Recruitment of new trees is extremely low due to livestock browsing on young seedlings thus preventing the natural replacement of the forest and logging in adjacent areas is increasing the tree\xe2\x80\x99s susceptibility to disease. In addition hunting of the parrots for food was prolific in Ecuador and trapping has had some impact in Colombia (4).,Thankfully due to cooperative conservation efforts the yellow-eared parrot and the wax palm have been given a new lease of life and are well on their way to recovery with a population of 660 birds a remarkable increase from an estimated 144 just a few short years ago (4) (6). A powerful alliance forged between Conservation International (CI) its partner Fundaci\xc3\xb3n ProAves and the Roman Catholic Church has ended the use of wax palm fronds in Palm Sunday services in much of Colombia and the U.S. hailed as one of the most successful biodiversity conservation campaigns in Latin American history. In 1999 Fundaci\xc3\xb3n ProAves with the support of CI American Bird Conservancy and Loro Parque Fundaci\xc3\xb3n began an intensive conservation project which included the creation of 25 private nature reserves and the reforestation of 36000 trees including 10000 wax palms (6). Breeding sites are being fenced to allow wax palm regeneration and artificial nest boxes are being provided (4). In addition national television campaigns in Colombia have helped educate the public about the problems the parrot and its habitat face and government police military and even rebel guerrilla forces now prohibit the sale or exploitation of both wax palms and yellow-eared parrots (6). The historical roosting site in Ecuador has also recently been bought and is being reforested and it is hoped that a public awareness campaign within the locality will stop hunting for food (4). ,hunting;disease; , ,2,0504,the 'Hoiho',Megadyptes antipodes,Yellow-eyed penguin (Megadyptes antipodes),Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Sphenisciformes,Spheniscidae,Megadyptes (1),5 í¢ŒóŒñ 8 kg (2),The yellow-eyed penguin may be the rarest penguin in the world. The coastal forests of their habitat particularly of mainland New Zealand have been destroyed to make way for development and agriculture. Introduced sheep and cattle pose a threat as they can trample on penguin nests and overgraze the area destroying further habitat (2). In 1986 and 1990 there were two major population crashes the causes of which remain a mystery (6). The other major threat to the yellow-eyed penguin comes from introduced mammalian predators such as ferrets cats rats and dogs; juvenile penguins or adults during their moult phase are extremely vulnerable to predation and numbers have been decimated over the years (2).,The New Zealand Department of Conservation Hoiho Recovery Plan is currently underway which aims to promote the recovery of this species and to involve local people in their conservation (5). A number of schemes are already in place including the protection of certain key habitats and the removal of predators. The Yellow-eyed Penguin Trust has introduced a number of important conservation initiatives and research including the banning of dogs from certain sensitive beaches (2). The Trust is careful to work extremely closely with local residents over these sensitive issues (2). Every effort is being made to secure the future of one of New Zealand\xe2\x80\x99s avian treasures. , , ,0,0505,Yellow-headed Amazon parrot,Amazona oratrix,Yellow-headed parrot (Amazona oratrix),Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Psittaciformes,Psittacidae,Amazona (1),Size: 35 í¢ŒóŒñ 38 cm (2),The primary threats facing the yellow-headed parrot are habitat destruction and over-collection for the pet trade (4). Many thousands have been illegally exported from Mexico and some from Belize each year and this bird is popular in domestic markets (2). Moreover it has been estimated that up to 90% of smuggled parrots die before reaching foreign markets (4). In Belize this bird is also hunted and persecuted for being a crop pest (2). Deforestation has been extensive with large areas cleared for agriculture pasture lumbar and settlements resulting in\xa0the loss of nesting and foraging habitat (2) (5). Nest poaching exacerbates habitat loss since nesting trees are often felled to get at nestlings destroying critical nest sites in the process (4).,The yellow-headed parrot is listed on CITES Appendix I prohibiting international trade in wild-caught specimens (3). Captive-breeding is fortunately now supplying much of the demand and most of the recent international trade has involved captive-bred birds although trapping continues to supply domestic markets and birds for illegal export. Trade is banned in Honduras and trapping and trade are banned in Belize (7). This parrot receives some protection in El Cielo Biosphere Reserve Sanoval Ranch in Mexico and in seven protected areas in Belize and there are several country-wide awareness campaigns in Mexico (2). However without further efforts to conserve habitat and control illegal domestic and international trade particularly in Mexico the yellow-headed parrot\xe2\x80\x99s future does not look bright (7). ,loss;poaching;pet; ,cites;protected; ,3,2506,Cyclemys annandalii; Hieremys annandalii,Heosemys annandalii,Yellow-headed temple turtle (Heosemys annandalii),Animalia,Chordata,Reptilia,Testudines,Geoemydidae,Hieremys (1),Length: up to 60 cm (2),Like many river turtles (8) the yellow-headed temple turtle is slowly being edged towards extinction as a result of man\xe2\x80\x99s actions. Taken from the wild for its meat and eggs for use in tradition medicines for the pet trade and for release into Buddhist temples (5) the yellow-headed temple turtle is now considered to be Endangered (1). Accentuating the impacts of exploitation in some areas is the threat of habitat loss. The lowland riverine habitat of the turtle in Lao PDR is unfortunately shared with high densities of people while in Malaysia suitable swamp habitat is at risk of being drained for land development. Suitable habitat is Thailand is also vulnerable to degradation with pollution and entanglement in fishing nets also affecting the yellow-headed temple turtle (5).,Throughout its range the yellow-headed temple turtle occurs in numerous protected areas and there are also national laws in place offering this species some protection although illegal trade remains of concern (5). In 2003 this turtle was listed on Appendix II of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) meaning that any international trade in this species should now be carefully monitored to ensure it is compatible with its survival (5) a measure which will hopefully go some way to aid the long term survival of this turtle. ,loss;fishing;pet;pollution; ,cites;protected; ,4,2507,Asian snail-eating box turtle; black-bellied box turtle; Chinese box turtle; snail-eating box turtle; yellow-rimmed box turtle,Cuora flavomarginata,Yellow-margined box turtle (Cuora flavomarginata),Animalia,Chordata,Reptilia,Testudines,Geoemydidae,Cuora (1),Adult carapace length: 19.5 cm (2)Hatchling carapace length: 40 mm (2)Average weight: 647 - 977 g (3),International trade in the yellow-margined box turtle as food or as a pet along with destruction of its habitat have caused a great decrease in this turtle\xe2\x80\x99s population.

The principle agent behind this decline was the creation of Greers Ferry Lake in 1962 which resulted in the inundation of downstream tributaries creating deep pools with increased sedimentation and lower oxygen levels in the water. As an inhabitant of shallow fast-moving streams the yellowcheek darter was displaced from much of its former range moving upstream to less suitable areas of habitat. The species\xe2\x80\x99 migratory behaviour was also disrupted while the loss of downstream refugia made the species more vulnerable to droughts resulting in the loss of many populations (7). Other threats such as the channelization of streams for agriculture and human consumption have isolated some populations and a loss of <strong>genetic diversity</strong> has been observed due to <strong>inbreeding</strong> (3) (8).,Having suffered such a severe decline the yellowcheek darter is in drastic need of major conservation measures. Indeed the species has been proposed for Threatened Status under the U.S Endangered Species Act (9). An agreement has also been made between several conservation organisations and landowners to mitigate threats to the species protect bordering terrestrial habitats; and explore potential reintroduction programmes (3). In conjunction with this several mature adults were taken from the wild in 2002 to start a captive breeding programme with the first individuals bred in 2003 and further successes in 2006 (10).\xa0 ,loss; ,captive breeding;endangered species act; ,1,2515,mohua,Mohoua ochrocephala,Yellowhead (Mohoua ochrocephala),Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Muscicapidae,Mohoua (1),Size: 15 cm (2)Male weight: 30 g (2)Female weight: 25 g (2),When Europeans first arrived in New Zealand the yellowhead was still abundant but forest clearances predation by introduced mammals and competition with introduced vespulid wasps (<i>Vespula</i> spp.) and birds all had a devastating effect on the species\xe2\x80\x99 survival (3) (6). As a result this bird has disappeared from 75 percent of its former range (4). As with much of New Zealand\xe2\x80\x99s endangered fauna habitat destruction has been a major cause of decline with many forests still being cleared or modified by selective logging. Predation also poses a serious threat with yellowheads suffering periodic population crashes when stoat (<i>Mustela erminea</i>) numbers erupt (4). These eruptions follow seasons of heavy beach seeding that occur every four to six years which allow species up the food chain to multiply with populations of insects then mice and then stoats proliferating (4) (6). Stoats prey upon eggs chicks and incubating adult females that are unable to escape from the nest hole resulting in huge losses and a dramatically biased sex ratio (4) (6). Black rats (<i>Rattus rattus</i>) brought over on ships are also excellent climbers and prey upon eggs chicks and incubating females (3) (4). It is also thought that stoat control initiatives in certain areas may have reduced predation on the increasing rat population (3) (6). Competition for insects and honeydew from introduced vespulid wasps has contributed to the bird\xe2\x80\x99s disappearance from beech honeydew forests in the northern South Island and introduced finches are thought to also be competing for food and contributing to the species\xe2\x80\x99 decline (6).,A monitoring programme established in 1983 carefully tracks 14 populations of yellowheads in 12 key sites and stoats have been trapped in key habitats during years of heavy seeding (4). Survival rates in the Eglinton Valley Fiordland National Park have been closely followed for more than ten years to monitor whether stoat control efforts are having a positive impact and initial results show that intensive trapping of predators does benefit the yellowhead (3). In addition birds have been translocated to three mammalian predator-free habitats including Codfish Island in 2003 where individuals proceeded to successfully breed the following season (4).

These slow-moving animals provide easy targets particularly with motorized vehicles and automatic weapons and their meat and leather are prized by local people (8). Other factors involved in the decline include <strong>desertification</strong> drought and habitat encroachment by pastoral expansion and subsistence agriculture (5) (10). It is estimated that fewer than five hundred individuals survive in the wild today with the bulk of these lying between the Termit area of Niger and the Bod\xc3\xa9l\xc3\xa9 region of Western Chad (9).,The addax is listed on Appendix I of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) thus prohibiting international trade (3). Provided effective protection is granted for the last remaining pockets of populations it is possible that the species can increase. With this in mind the Sahara Conservation Fund has developed a regional strategy that when implemented will protect the remaining wild populations and facilitate the recolonisation of neighbouring suitable habitats (10). A protected population exists in the Yotvata Hai-Bar (Wildlife Preserve) Nature Reserve in Israel to the north of Elat (11). The reserve was set up in 1968 with the view to bolster populations of endangered desert species (12). In Niger a vast protected area is being established in the Termit region to protect the largest remaining addax population in the wild (10).

The species is now restricted to a few forest patches in the south and east of the island where fewer than 300 may now survive\xa0(1)\xa0(4)\xa0(6). This decline is likely to be continuing with the main threats to the species being habitat loss due to illegal wood-cutting and the spread of agriculture and continued illegal hunting with the species being highly sought after for its meat and skin\xa0(1)\xa0(4)\xa0(5)\xa0(6)\xa0(9)\xa0(11). Deforestation and forest degradation has led to the severe fragmentation of the duiker\xe2\x80\x99s habitat but firewood collection unfortunately remains one of the few sources of income for many people living near the forests\xa0(1). An additional threat may be posed by the presence of feral dogs which are thought to have destroyed an introduced duiker population on Funzi Island\xa0(5).,Aders\xe2\x80\x99 duiker is a protected species in both Kenya and Zanzibar (1) although the law is often poorly enforced (9). A Species Recovery Plan is in place on Zanzibar with recommendations including improved protected status for the species the development of a new larger conservation area with a strict anti-hunting policy conservation education programmes continued population monitoring and further research into the species\xe2\x80\x99 behaviour and ecology (6). A conservation and recovery plan has also been proposed for Kenya (1). In 2000 five Aders\xe2\x80\x99 duikers were <strong>translocated</strong> to the well protected privately run conservation area of Chumbe Island where a female was already present but the success of this programme needs to be monitored (1) (4) (6).

These animals are hunted for food and for traditional medicine in both Ethiopia and Somalia where recent civil unrest has led to an increased number of weapons in circulation. Competition with domestic livestock for grazing and restricted access to water supplies caused by agricultural developments pose further threats to the survival of this species (4).,The African wild ass is legally protected in the countries within which it is currently found (4) although these measures often prove difficult to enforce. More effective protection measures need to be adopted if the status of this species is to improve.

The drop in numbers is probably attributable to a range of threats including habitat loss and poaching by hunters who are trafficking exotic animals (2). Most devastating however has been the introduction of alien species (5). Feral dogs first reported in 1994 are known to kill adult iguanas and predation by an exploding population of feral cats on juveniles is responsible for the deaths of many hatchlings each year (2) (5). The primary threat however comes from competition for food from feral livestock with the island teeming with sheep goats donkeys and cattle that have been released to roam freely across Anegada (2) (4). Grazing pressure from these livestock has radically changed the composition of vegetation available to the iguana shifting the species\xe2\x80\x99 diet to rely more on plants with secondary compounds with dubious nutritional value (2).,The Anegada Iguana Recovery Programme began in 1997 which included establishing a \xe2\x80\x98headstart\xe2\x80\x99 facility. This facility collects hatchlings and nurtures them in captivity until they can be safely released into the wild with the aim of combating the high rates of juvenile mortality due to cat predation by raising them until they are large enough that predation will not pose as great a threat (6). The first 24 were released into the wild in October 2003 with an 84 percent survival rate and a second group of 24 were released in October 2004 and these are currently being tracked (5). In the 1980s small numbers of these iguanas were removed from Anegada and restored to parts of their former range on Guana Island where the species appears to be doing well in the absence of introduced predators (1) (2). The Guana Island Wildlife Sanctuary continues to try to rid the island of sheep the only feral grazing competitor on the island which may improve the habitat there for the iguanas (1). The species was also later introduced to Necker Island (2). A national park designed to protect this Critically Endangered iguana on Anegada has been approved in principle by the Anegada Lands Committee but rampant debates over land ownership and property boundaries impede developments and must be resolved before this project can progress (2) (4). Further conservation actions advocated include a cat eradication programme and the construction of fences around protected areas to keep livestock out.

Most devastating however has been the introduction of alien species (5). Feral dogs first reported in 1994 are known to kill adult iguanas and predation by an exploding population of feral cats on juveniles is responsible for the deaths of many hatchlings each year (2) (5). The primary threat however comes from competition for food from feral livestock with the island teeming with sheep goats donkeys and cattle that have been released to roam freely across Anegada (2) (4).

The small numbers caught are utilised for human consumption and possibly also used for oil and fishmeal (5). A more widespread potential threat is the capture of this species as by-catch (5). As they lie on the bottom angel sharks are particularly vulnerable to <strong>by-catch</strong> in trawl fisheries an activity that has increased in the last 50 years. As a result numbers of angel sharks have declined dramatically and have even been declared extinct in the North Sea (1).,All <i>Squatina</i> species are protected within three Balearic Islands marine reserves where fishing for these species is forbidden (1). The status of the angel shark in many parts of its range is unknown (1) and the impact of fisheries is unclear (5) and thus research is required and conservation measures urgently need to be implemented (1) to assure the conservation of this unusual and distinctive shark. , ,protected; ,0,1527,Annam pond turtle,Mauremys annamensis,Annam leaf turtle (Mauremys annamensis),Animalia,Chordata,Reptilia,Testudines,Geoemydidae,Mauremys (1),Length: up to 20 cm (2),\xa0Unfortunately the small range that the Annam leaf turtle inhabits is a prime location for rice production; vast areas of central Vietnam are continuously cleared and transformed for agricultural expansion and development (4) (7).

There is a massive demand for this species from markets in China where they can often be found for sale as meat or traditional \xe2\x80\x98medicine\xe2\x80\x99 (2) (4).,The Annam leaf turtle is protected under Vietnam\xe2\x80\x99s wildlife protection law (4) and is also listed under Appendix II of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) which means that international trade in this species should be carefully monitored (3). Despite trade in this species being illegal the law is often poorly enforced and trade still continues (4). Various breeding programmes have recently been set up and captive populations are increasing.

Not only are these turtles consumed but their shells are also sold for traditional medicinal use (5). Hunting usually involves using trained dogs to search out the turtles but limited burning of bamboo forests to intercept and capture fleeing turtles also takes place. Fortunately the market demand for this species is relatively low and current harvesting levels are thought to be minimal. Extensive tracts of habitat remain and the human population density of the region is amongst the lowest in Southeast Asia (6). Nevertheless habitat loss and degradation may represent additional threats due to logging operations road construction forest clearance for agriculture large-scale bamboo harvesting for a proposed paper mill and uncontrolled forest fires (5) (6). Furthermore this turtle\xe2\x80\x99s restricted geographic range low population density late onset of sexual maturity and low reproductive output render it vulnerable to overexploitation (5) (6). These combined threats have left the species in grave danger of extinction so much so that it was officially recognised in 2003 as one of the world\xe2\x80\x99s top 25 most endangered turtles (4).,The Arakan forest turtle is listed as a Protected Species in the Protection of Wildlife Wild Plants and Conservation of Natural Areas Law of Myanmar which was enacted in 1994. Furthermore two large areas in the Arakan Yoma Hill range Thanlwe-ma-e-chaung and Taungup Pass/Thandwe-chaung have been proposed for official protected status. These areas are found just south of known Arakan forest turtle inhabited zones and possess similar habitat types as those currently used by the species (5). This turtle may already occur in the vicinity of these proposed protected areas although no records exist or could potentially be introduced to the regions should they be given protected status. Good numbers of this species exist in captivity where attempts are being made to better understand its biology which could help to guide effective conservation plans or possibly even lead to captive breeding and reintroduction programmes in the future (4). In the meantime captive stock acts as an insurance population that buffers against total extinction. Nevertheless it is imperative that every effort is now made to protect this little-known species which managed to elude detection for so long if we are to prevent it from disappearing from the wild forever. ,loss;hunting; ,captive breeding;protected; ,2,2532,Armeria purpurea,Armeria helodes,Armeria (Armeria helodes),Plantae,Tracheophyta,Magnoliopsida,Plumbaginales,Plumbaginaceae,Armeria (1),Height: 25 - 45 cm (2),At the start of the 20th century <em>Armeria helodes</em> was widespread across around 60 square kilometres of wetlands.

Each subpopulation contains just five to ten mature plants and <em>Armeria helodes</em> is considered to be at high risk of extinction (1) (4) (7).,<em>Armeria helodes</em> is classified as \xe2\x80\x98Critically Endangered\xe2\x80\x99 in Italy (1) (2) and is listed as an important species in Annex II of the EU Habitats Directive which aims to protect habitats and species across Europe (8). ,pet;pollution; ,protected; ,2,1533,Arubian cascabel,Crotalus unicolor,Aruba Island rattlesnake (Crotalus unicolor),Animalia,Chordata,Reptilia,Squamata,Viperidae,Crotalus (1),0.9 - 1.4 kg (2),This species is threatened because it only occurs on one small island where just ten square kilometres of habitat remains undisturbed. In past centuries much of the island\xe2\x80\x99s trees were cut down for charcoal and firewood removing this snake's shelter and prey (6). Recent threats include resort development on the island and other forms of human encroachment. Goats have been introduced and have wreaked havoc on the vegetation. This species is also caught and illegally exported for the pet trade (4).,The Government and people of Aruba do recognise this <strong>endemic</strong> species as important and have set aside a large area of interior land as protected habitat for this and other species (2). The American Zoo and Aquarium Association (AZA) Aruba Island rattlesnake Species Survival Plan (SSP) is currently building on the island\xe2\x80\x99s conservation efforts. Field research is being carried out to determine population size natural history traits and factors affecting the survival of the Aruba Island rattlesnake in order to best inform conservation efforts. There is also an ongoing public relations campaign to change local people\xe2\x80\x99s perceptions of this venomous snake (6).

Populations in South East Asia had all but disappeared by the mid-20th century. These declines have been attributed to direct causes such as hunting and live capture as well as the indirect effects of a reduction in carrion as hygiene improved across the region (5). Having suffered an extremely rapid decline in numbers due to a previously unknown cause the Asian white-backed vulture is in danger of imminent extinction without immediate conservation action. By 2000 dead and dying <i>Gyps</i> vultures were being found so frequently in Nepal and India it was thought that they were suffering from an epidemic. The unnaturally high death toll was thought to be caused by a fatal virus but testing has revealed that vultures are suffering from kidney failure following the consumption of cattle that had previously been treated with the anti-inflammatory drug diclofenac (2). In fact the decline is a result of a lethal level of the drug in a small proportion of the <strong>ungulate</strong> carcasses available to vultures but as vultures travel long distances to reach <strong>carrion</strong> a considerable proportion of the population has been affected (6).,It is necessary to prevent exposure of vultures to livestock carcasses that have been contaminated with diclofenac and to find an alternative replacement drug (7). Government commitment to the control of the use of the drug is crucial but until it has been entirely removed from the environment a collaboration of bird protection organisations plan to take all Asian white-backed vultures into captivity for the next 20 to 30 years to avoid further deaths which would further reduce the chance of a successful recovery of this already rare species (7). ,hunting; , ,1,0535,black bass; esonue grouper; giant seabass; goliath grouper; guasa; hamlet; jewfish; southern jewfish; spotted jewfish,Epinephelus itajara,Atlantic goliath grouper (Epinephelus itajara),Animalia,Chordata,Actinopterygii,Perciformes,Serranidae,Epinephelus (1),up to 360 kg (3),The Atlantic goliath grouper is particularly prone to over-fishing because of its large size slow growth rate low reproductive rate and group <strong>spawning</strong> activity.

This prompted legislative protection preventing fishing of this species.

On Little Water Cay boardwalks and observation towers have been constructed at two popular landing sites to reduce the damaging impacts of tourism and a visitation fee has been implemented with the proceeds going towards supporting conservation activities. A trapping programme to remove feral cats from Pine Water and (if necessary) Little Water Cays has also been established by the National Trust (5). ,loss;poaching;environmental;environment;pet; ,protected; ,5,1545,Chinese river dolphin; white flag dolphin; whitefin dolphin; Yangtze River dolphin,Lipotes vexillifer,Baiji (Lipotes vexillifer),Animalia,Chordata,Mammalia,Cetartiodactyla,Lipotidae,Lipotes (1),Male length: up to 229 cm (2)Female length: up to 253 cm (2)Length at birth: 0.9 m (3),The Yangtze River is one of the world\xe2\x80\x99s busiest waterways (3) and is subject to a great range of human pressures that have had a devastating effect on the baiji.

Indeed with an annual decline estimated at around eight percent this highly threatened seabird could go extinct within the next 40 years (10). At present the greatest threat to the Balearic shearwater is thought to be unnatural adult mortality (11)\xa0(12). On land this may be caused by predation by introduced cats rats and genets (<em>Geneta geneta</em>) and the species may have gone extinct on Cabrera Island as a result (6). At sea this species has a close association with trawlers from which it takes fish discards and mass mortality has been observed where fish lines have come too close to large groups of birds (2).\xa0,Recognising the tragic fate of the Balearic shearwater the Balearic Government introduced a recovery plan in 1997 which aimed to increase the population and its distribution to all suitable areas of habitat (6). The implementation of this plan has seen the eradication of rats from several nesting sites and the creation of three Special Protected Areas which protect all nesting areas (2). However despite these efforts addressing the high rate of mortality at sea remains a crucial factor in avoiding the extinction of this species (10). This majestic seabird is also benefiting from a large number of studies into its ecology population size distribution priority conservation areas and threats (2). ,loss;pet;pollution; ,protected; ,3,1548,Bali myna; Bali mynah; Rothschildí¢ŒóŒ»s myna; Rothschildí¢ŒóŒ»s mynah; Rothschildí¢ŒóŒ»s starling; white starling,Leucopsar rothschildi,Bali starling (Leucopsar rothschildi),Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Sturnidae,Leucopsar (1),85 - 90 g (4),The Bali starling is thought to have always had a relatively small range and may never have occurred in large numbers but its population has declined dramatically since its discovery (2) mostly as a result of the illegal collection of birds for the captive bird trade (1) (2) (3) (9). By 1990 illegal poaching had reduced Bali starling numbers to just 15 individuals (1) (3) (9) and by 2001 only 6 wild individuals remained (9).,The Bali starling is listed on Appendix I of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) which means that commercial trade in this bird is prohibited (5).

The total wild population is believed to number just 1300 reproductive individuals with only 100 existing on Mauritius. The threat to this species is further compounded by the fact that its reproduction success and reestablishment is very poor. The reasons for this are currently unclear but are likely to be due to consumption of the palm\xe2\x80\x99s fruit and seedlings by introduced animals such as rats and pigs (2) (3).,In order to help preserve wild populations of barbel palm the Office National des For\xc3\xaats on R\xc3\xa9union has undertaken an extensive restoration programme (3). Their efforts may be aided by the recent discovery of a large population of this species on Rodrigues which has the potential to provide an abundance of plant material to establish new stocks (2) (3). , , ,0,0550,tuntong,Batagur baska,Batagur (Batagur baska),Animalia,Chordata,Reptilia,Testudines,Bataguridae,Batagur (1),Length: up to 60 cm (2),Numbers of batagur have been decimated by the loss of habitat and the over-collection of both adults and eggs (5). Recently there has been an increase in the market for turtle meat and eggs in Asia and the resulting unsustainable harvest has pushed many species to the brink of extinction (7). It is estimated that batugars in Malaysia declined by over 90% during the 20th Century (8) and the species is now considered to be Critically Endangered (1).,These turtles are listed on Appendix I of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) (3); international trade is thus prohibited although illegal collection is still widespread (1).

Around 1977 hunting of the Bawean deer diminished giving populations the respite they needed to recover slightly (7).,In 1979 the Bawean Island Nature Reserve was established (7) offering the mountainous habitat of the Bawean deer some much needed protection.  Management activities on the island have included protecting the deer from hunting the controlled burning of grasslands to provide deer habitat and the thinning of teak plantations to encourage understorey development on which the deer can browse (7) (9).  The removal of wild dogs has also been recommended (9).

Grasslands throughout its range are threatened by drainage conversion to agriculture overgrazing heavy flooding and inappropriate cutting and burning regimes (6).  The Tonle Sap grasslands an extremely important area for breeding Bengal floricans have declined by 60 percent since the late 1990s with the intensification of rice cultivation playing a significant role in this loss in recent years (7).  However not all human activity should be looked upon as negative as many grasslands in the absence of large native herbivores rely on activities such as grazing and burning for their existence (7).  Unfortunately reaching the correct balance of human activities is not an easy task and the management of many grasslands even those within protected areas results in habitat unsuitable for the Bengal florican (8).,The Bengal florican occurs in a number of protected areas including the Royal Chitwan National Park and Royal Bardia National Park in Nepal (8) Dudwa National Park in India and possibly in Tram Chim National Park Vietnam and Ang Trapeang Thmor Sarus Crane Conservation Area in Cambodia (6).

Indeed so dramatic were these declines that between 1932 and 1980 commercial landings diminished from 115 tonnes biomass to 5 tonnes in Californian waters and from 363 tonnes to 12 tonnes in Mexican waters. The species\xe2\x80\x99 limited distribution large size and aggregation in spawning areas made it an easy target for fisheries (1). Unfortunately its slow growth and late onset of sexual maturity make the fish extremely vulnerable to population collapses from over-fishing and slow to recover (5). Additionally it appears that the black sea bass may also be suffering from toxin poisoning. Sediments along the coast of California have been found to carry very high levels of toxins such as DDE and PCB with an area off the Palos Verdes peninsula thought to contain possibly the highest loads of DDE (a breakdown product of DDT) in the world\xe2\x80\x99s oceans. The toxins cannot be broken down so as a mid-level predator black sea bass ingest the cumulative toxins in increased concentrations from the food chain below it and have been found to be carrying extremely high body burdens of DDE and PCB in southern California. The chemicals have been recorded to interfere with normal reproductive biology in other species of fish as well as amphibians reptiles and birds but more research is needed into the effects they are having on this giant fish and its process of recovery in California (3).,The black sea bass has been protected in California since 1981 and in Mexico since 1992. Both commercial and recreational fishing of this species were prohibited in California in 1981 although two fish per angler per trip are allowed to be caught south of the U.S.-Mexican border and one fish per trip to be taken incidentally by commercial fishermen. The law also limited the amount of black sea bass that could be caught in Mexican waters and landed in California (1). Although these laws have prevented commercial fishermen from targeting and profiting from these fish they have failed to protect the habitats occupied by the species from fishing and have probably done little to reduce incidental mortality since black sea bass entangled in nets have simply been discarded back into the sea (5). Indeed many fish in spawning aggregations in the summer have been caught and released frequently receiving injuries in the process (6). However the banning of gill nets in California in 1990 has probably helped significantly reduce the incidental mortality of this species and anecdotal data suggest that numbers may be beginning to rebound (1) (5). Nevertheless either voluntary or imposed seasonal and/or area closures would undoubtedly help further minimise incidental mortalities and greatly aid the recovery of this magnificent and dramatic giant of the sea (3) (6). ,fishing; ,protected; ,1,1559,Ruffed lemur,Varecia variegata,Black-and-white ruffed lemur (Varecia variegata),Animalia,Chordata,Mammalia,Primates,Lemuridae,Varecia (1),3 í¢ŒóŒñ 4.5 kg (2),As with other lemur species the black-and-white ruffed lemur is threatened by habitat loss through logging agriculture mining and other development in Madagascar (1) (7). When human activities encroach upon rainforest habitat this species is one of the first lemurs to disappear (1). Hunting also threatens this rare primate; unfortunately its large size and daylight activity pattern makes it an attractive target and it is among the most heavily hunted of all Madagascar\xe2\x80\x99s lemurs (1).,The black-and-white ruffed lemur occurs in a number of protected areas such as Mananara-Nord National Park Zahamena National Park and Mantadia National Park. Although sadly this Critically Endangered species has also vanished from other areas such as Analamazaotra Special Reserve and Andringitra National Park and other forests urgently require protection if this species is to survive (1). The black-and-white lemur has been the subject of captive breeding efforts with a number being reintroduced to Madagascar\xe2\x80\x99s Betampona Reserve between 1997 and 2001 (1) (9). Unfortunately this has had limited success as animals that have not grown up in the wild typically have great difficulty adapting (9). Reintroduction is a long and costly process (9) and is rendered worthless if there is no safe natural habitat in which they can be released into. Thus hopefully efforts to protect Madagascar\xe2\x80\x99s habitats by numerous conservation organisations will be successful. ,loss;hunting; ,captive breeding;protected; ,2,2560,black crested gibbon; black gibbon; crested gibbon; Indochinese gibbon,Nomascus concolor,Black-crested gibbon (Nomascus concolor),Animalia,Chordata,Mammalia,Primates,Hylobatidae,Nomascus (1),5.7 kg (2),Deforestation has swept across South East Asia at an alarming rate as trees are logged for timber or to make way for agriculture and development. Gibbons throughout the region have undergone dramatic declines due principally to this habitat loss but also as a result of hunting (4). The fragmentation of their habitat causes groups to become separated from the remaining population (2) and it is estimated that about 75 percent of the black crested gibbon\xe2\x80\x99s original habitat has already been lost (9). The taxonomic confusion surrounding this species makes population estimates particularly difficult but at least two of the subspecies are today at critically low levels (1).,The black-crested gibbon is protected from international trade by its listing on Appendix I of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) (3). Fauna and Flora International (FFI) have been studying the species in Northern Vietnam since 1999. They have also been involved in a community awareness programmes in the area and there is pressure to designate the last stronghold of the species (the Che Tao Forest) as a Gibbon Sanctuary (4). In China the largest population of the Central Yunnan black crested gibbon subspecies occurs within the Wuliang Mountain National Reserve (4).

The loss of habitat has been so extensive that little now remains (2). Additionally this species is prized by hunters and is particularly vulnerable during the breeding season because of the conspicuous vocalisations performed by the males making them easy to locate. At this time the eggs are also taken from the nests to incubate and rear for trade and consumption (6). Sadly loss and fragmentation of habitat only serves to facilitate easier access to the bird for poachers (2).,South America\xe2\x80\x99s newest nature reserve Reserva Natural El Paujil was established in 2004 by the Colombian bird conservation NGO Fundaci\xc3\xb3n ProAves (2) (7).

Indeed the species was thought to have been lost from the wild until it was rediscovered in 1992 (2). Ironically the rarity of this species makes it even more desirable for collectors and the illegal trade appears to continue to this date (3). Surviving populations are extremely fragmented and vulnerable (2). Established land management practices including burning of under-storey in palm groves also mitigate against recovery of the population (6).,The blue-throated macaw is protected by law in Bolivia (2) and international trade is prohibited by its listing on Appendix I of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) (4). Illegal trade appears to continue however and it has been recommended that full-time guards may be required to halt this process (2). Problems arise however from the fact that much of this bird\xe2\x80\x99s range is on privately owned ranches (5). Research is also needed into the natural ecology of this species so that effective management plans can be implemented (2). Fortunately there are several organisations involved with the research and conservation of this bird and a Species Recovery Plan has now been formulated. NGO Armon\xc3\xada Bolivia\xe2\x80\x99s BirdLife International partner also set up the Blue-throated Macaw Conservation Programme which they have worked on in conjunction with the Loro Parque Fundaci\xc3\xb3n to save this Critically Endangered bird. Incredibly in October 2004 this programme found a new disjunct population at Santa Rosa 100 kilometres west of previous records providing new hope that more blue-throated macaws exist in the wild than previously thought (6). The programme\xe2\x80\x99s important work on mapping the species assessing its numbers and threats in different areas will certainly help guide priority conservation decisions in the future and hopefully help bring this beautiful bird back from the brink of extinction (5). ,pet; ,cites;protected; ,1,2564,Clemmys muhlenbergii,Glyptemys muhlenbergii,Bog turtle (Glyptemys muhlenbergii),Animalia,Chordata,Reptilia,Testudines,Emydidae,Glyptemys (1),Length: up to 11.4 cm (2),The bog turtle faces numerous potential threats but the most significant and damaging is the loss alteration and fragmentation of its wetland habitat. Many areas are being drained dredged filled or flooded for urban development agriculture and pond and reservoir construction (4) (5). The loss and alteration of suitable habitat increases the risk of bog turtles being killed on roads and leaves them more exposed to predation (5). The impact of this habitat loss on bog turtle populations is being compounded by the illegal wildlife trade (5) as unfortunately the small size unique colouration and rarity of this turtle makes it highly valued in the pet trade (4).,Bog turtles are legally protected or regulated in nearly all states in which they occur (2) but most of these regulations relate just to the species and do not provide protection to its habitat (5). However many states are increasing efforts to conserve both bog turtles and their habitat and a number of wetland habitats containing turtle populations throughout the range are protected (5). ,loss;fragmentation;pet; ,cites;protected; ,3,2565,Fungi,Erioderma pedicellatum,Boreal felt lichen (Erioderma pedicellatum),Fungi,Ascomycota,Lecanoromycetes,Lecanorales,Pannariaceae,Erioderma (1),Diameter: 2 - 5 cm (2),In addition to being highly sensitive to atmospheric pollutants such as acid rain the boreal felt lichen is extremely vulnerable to habitat loss (1) (2). Logging not only removes lichen substrate but also alters the microclimate of the forest a factor to which this species is particularly susceptible (4). Owing to the impacts of habitat loss and air pollution the Atlantic population has declined by more than 90 percent over the past two decades (2) (3).,The Atlantic population of the boreal felt lichen is protected in Canada under the Federal Species at Risk Act (SARA) and is the focus of an ongoing recovery strategy (2). Crucially efforts are being made through land purchases and agreements with landowners to formally protect areas of forest that are home to this rare species (2) (3). Furthermore conservationists are engaging with private and government forest managers to encourage their participation in the mapping of boreal felt lichen habitat and the implementation of management plans that will prevent further habitat loss (2). ,loss;pollution; ,protected; ,2,1566,Bornean orang-utan,Pongo pygmaeus,Bornean orangutan (Pongo pygmaeus),Animalia,Chordata,Mammalia,Primates,Hominidae,Pongo (1),Male head-body length: 97 cm (2)Female head-body length: 78 cm (2)Male weight: 60 - 90 kg (2)Female weight: 40 - 50 kg (2),In the past orangutans were hunted relentlessly in the majority of their Southeast Asian range with their large size and slow movements making them easy targets for hunters (9).

Historically this species was considered a pest and over three million were killed between 1880 and 1920 for bounty money (7). The introduction of predators and competitors such as foxes cats rats and rabbits combined with habitat reduction from farming and altered burning regimes have all had detrimental effects on the species (2).,The Critically Endangered brush-tailed bettong is reliant on the monitoring and reduction of fox populations as well as careful habitat management for its survival (7). Research is currently underway to identify possible new <strong>translocation</strong> sites (1) and an investigation is being carried out by the Woylie Conservation Research Project to discover why all large brush-tailed bettong populations across Australia dramatically declined in 2001.

Although \xe2\x80\x98subsistence\xe2\x80\x99 gathering of the species has occurred for hundreds of years by native people together with collection for its yellow-rayed <strong>carapace</strong> which is used for a container for cooking oil seeds etc. the impact was relatively small and sustainable. In recent years however subsistence has been replaced by mass commercial harvesting as the price of this species skyrocketed in the Asian markets (primarily Taiwan and China) (8). The tortoise has also been hard hit recently by the illegal international pet trade often ending up in European and North American collections (9). With their distinctive markings and dramatic colours these tortoises are attractive to collectors and their rarity makes them particularly valuable (10). Indeed adults can fetch up to US$7000 each from private collectors in the Western world (10) and this high price and demand encourages overexploitation of wild populations (5). Habitat destruction and wild fires also pose a threat to these tortoises particularly to smaller individuals (5).,The Burmese star tortoise exists in two protected areas Shwe Settaw Wildlife Sanctuary and Minzontaung Wildlife Sanctuary and an area proposed for protected status Myaleik Taung. At the Minzontaung Wildlife Sanctuary and Myaleik Taung the species is protected by local religious beliefs that deem it bad luck to collect the tortoises and commercial poaching is so far virtually non-existent. The Sanctuary is also well patrolled by guards with access strictly controlled and wild fires are managed. The Minzontaung Wildlife Sanctuary and Myaleik Taung therefore offer excellent potential for the successful conservation of the Burmese star tortoise (5). Sadly the Shwe Settaw Wildlife Sanctuary does not seem to be faring so well which has recently been reduced by around 30% due to the sale of a large tract to an agricultural development consortium. Subsistence and commercial harvest from the Sanctuary is commonplace with one village trader admitting to collecting 300 individuals in 6 months and there being at least one trader in every village. The Burmese star tortoise is fully protected by law and it is a capital offence to remove them from the wild. However the Myanmar Government reportedly ignore the capture and sale of these tortoises or are easily bribed with rampant civil war and radical guerrilla soldiers near the borders deterring police involvement there. A captive breeding programme has been set up at the Shwe Settaw Wildlife Sanctuary but hybridisation with <i>Indotestudo elongata</i> in a shared fenced area has been common. There is also evidence that this area is quickly grazed and tortoises here starve to death at an alarming rate. Stricter enforcement of protection laws is desperately needed and more effective management protocols at this Sanctuary but as long as a lucrative market exists tortoise hunting is likely to remain an attractive economic option for rural people (8). One suggestion has been to promote the significance of rural religious beliefs for the benefit of tortoise conservation in this area which has helped protect this beautiful species so effectively in the Minzontaung Wildlife Sanctuary and Myaleik Taung (5). However in a financially depressed society such as this the economic lure of such profitable natural resources may sadly win out (8). ,pet; ,protection law;captive breeding;protected; ,1,3574,Rapanea sechellarum,Rapanea seychellarum,Bwa klate (Rapanea seychellarum),Plantae,Tracheophyta,Magnoliopsida,Primulales,Myrsinaceae,Rapanea (1),Height: up to 5 m (2),In 1998 the entire population of bwa klate was estimated to consist of less than 50 individuals (1).  While this plant is not currently known to be facing any negative impacts the tiny population makes it incredibly vulnerable to any threats that may arise and thus it has been classified as Critically Endangered by the IUCN (1).,The bwa klate occurs within the Morne Seychellois National Park and Praslin National Park as well as areas of forest protected by the Nature Protection Trust of Seychelles (NPTS) (1).

Indeed goats had reduced the remaining wild specimen to a small half-eaten shrub when it was first discovered. Owing to the unprecedented level of scientific interest that surrounded the little plant in the aftermath of its re-discovery local people became convinced of the plant\xe2\x80\x99s medicinal properties (2). Consequently there was a period before the erection of multiple fences (1) (2) and even the installation of a guard when people were intent on removing branches twigs and leaves from the hapless plant (7). Although the protection of the single wild specimen has now been secured the real obstacle to the species\xe2\x80\x99 long-term survival is establishing an efficient means of propagating a non-sterile population from an effectively sterile plant (2).,Relatively soon after the re-discovery of the caf\xc3\xa9 marron cuttings from the surviving plant were sent to Kew Gardens in England. At Kew scientists were successful in propagating clones of the plant from the cuttings but could not find a means of successfully fertilising the flowers in order to produce seeds (2). Then in 2003 a major breakthrough was made when researchers discovered a technique to bypass the plant\xe2\x80\x99s self-incompatibility mechanism resulting in the production of a small number of viable seeds (2) (8). Since then several seeds have been successfully germinated at a nursery on Rodrigues with the aim of eventually re-vitalising a wild population on the island (9). ,loss;invasive; , ,2,0576,kitty mitchell; speckled hind; strawberry grouper,Epinephelus drummondhayi,Calico grouper (Epinephelus drummondhayi),Animalia,Chordata,Actinopterygii,Perciformes,Serranidae,Epinephelus (1),up to 30 kg (2),Exploitation of the calico grouper in recreational and commercial fisheries has brought this species to the brink of extinction (1). Although there are limits to how many groupers can be taken in each fishing trip the sheer number of fishermen (there are one million recreational licenses in Florida alone) has caused the population to continue to decline (1). As shallow water fish stocks decrease fishing is taking place in increasingly deep water in order to improve catch rates increasing the threat to the calico grouper (1).,In the eastern part of its range only one calico grouper may be taken per vessel per trip for both recreational and commercial boats; if more are taken these may not be traded or sold at sea (5). Limits for recreational and commercial boats also exist in the Gulf of Mexico (7) but unfortunately these regulations do nothing to prevent <strong>bycatch</strong> mortality. ,fishing; ,protected; ,1,1577,Cí€Œ_ndor Californiano; Cí€Œ_ndor de California,Gymnogyps californianus,California condor (Gymnogyps californianus),Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Falconiformes,Cathartidae,Gymnogyps (1),9 kg (2),The original decline of the California condor followed the extinction of many large mammals in North America (5). Despite legal protection since 1900 (10) the 20th Century decline was due to human induced pressures such as trapping shooting egg collecting and lead poisoning following ingestion of carcasses killed with lead shot (2). Unfortunately lead poisoning still occurs regularly and remains the condor's greatest threat; other current threats include collisions with power lines shooting and both deliberate and accidental poisoning (12).,Towards the end of the 1980s with only eight individuals left in the wild it was clear that the extinction of this bird was imminent. The remaining wild individuals were taken into captivity and incorporated into an intensive conservation breeding programme run by San Diego Wild Animal Park Los Angeles Zoo and The Peregrine Fund (13). A variety of techniques were used in the breeding programme including <strong>double-clutching</strong> and the rearing of chicks with hand puppets and in 1992 the first condors were released back into the wild (14). Numerous hurdles have had to be overcome not least teaching captive birds to avoid power cables but in the spring of 2002 the first wild condor chick for two decades hatched (13). The rescue of the Californian condor is an ongoing conservation programme but the successes so far have been inspiring and the population continues to climb (8); today the condor can once again be seen soaring over the rocky Californian landscape. , , ,0,0578,four-coloured flowerpecker; orange-backed flowerpecker,Dicaeum quadricolor,Cebu flowerpecker (Dicaeum quadricolor),Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Dicaeidae,Dicaeum (1),Length: 11 - 12 cm (2),The island of Cebu has long been notorious for its deforestation\xa0(6). The native forests of the island were rapidly cleared as far back as the 1890s and a century later barely 0.03 percent or 15 square kilometres of the original forest cover remained\xa0(2). The rediscovery of the Cebu flowerpecker was unexpected because of the almost total loss of its habitat but what tiny forest patches do remain are still under threat from illegal settlement and logging road construction shifting cultivation firewood collection charcoal making and clearance for mining. In addition competition with the red-striped flowerpecker (<em>Dicaeum australe</em>) may have exacerbated the species\xe2\x80\x99 decline. With a population estimated at only around 100 individuals (as of 2009) and with a highly fragmented range totalling just 8 square kilometres the future of this small bird is highly uncertain\xa0(2)\xa0(3)\xa0(4) (7).,The Cebu flowerpecker has been the focus of a number of conservation efforts since its rediscovery. In 2009 it was chosen as the flagship species for the British Birdwatching Fair the largest fair of its kind in the world and the Philippines Department of Tourism has also pledged support for the species including financial support for conservation efforts by the Cebu Biodiversity Conservation Foundation\xa0(5) (8).

It is difficult to assess whether the population merely undergoes dramatic fluctuations in response to climate change or if other factors are also to blame for past population crashes (2). Some potential threats however include the loss of habitat through inappropriate fire management or grazing by feral herbivores such as horses (2).

The <strong>colonies</strong> of Chatham Island itself are plagued by humans cattle pigs sheep cats dogs weka (<i>Gallirallus australis</i>) and brush-tailed possums (<i>Trichosurus vulpecula</i>). Disturbance is thought to cause the birds to trample on their nests; breaking the eggs before abandoning the site. Breeding sites have also been abandoned following the arrival of the fur seal (<i>Arctocephalus forsteri</i>) on Star Keys Island. Small numbers of birds are shot or caught in crayfish pots and it is thought that changes in the marine environment may have affected the availability of fish species (2).,A census of the Chatham Island shag was taken in 1997 and a follow-up was done in 2003-2004 as part of the Chatham Island Shag and Pitt Island Shag Recovery Plan that was brought into effect in 2001. It recommends that the population as a whole is surveyed every five years but that a closer eye is kept on the colonies of Chatham Island with a census each year. Authorities are hoping to come to an agreement with local land and stock owners that would enable fences to be built around breeding <strong>colonies</strong>. Dog owners need to be educated as to the effect their pets can have on the Chatham Island shag and eco-tourists must be similarly supervised.

Habitat destruction has been the major cause of this decline and wetland areas continue to be modified for agriculture in an effort to cope with the intense human population pressure in the region (4). A highly secretive species spending a long period of time (6 to 7 months) below ground in burrows the Chinese alligator now primarily exists in populated areas where it inevitably comes into conflict with local farmers. Burrow systems cause drainage problems for fields and alligators also consume ducks owned by farmers (2). Despite a lack of commercial value for the Chinese alligator's skin on the international market these reptiles are often killed when encountered either through fear or due to a threat to livelihood (2).,In contrast to the decimated wild population the breeding of captive Chinese alligators has been very successful and the captive population currently exceeds 10000 individuals (2). The Anhui Research Centre of Chinese Alligator Reproduction (ARCCAR) was established in 1979 and houses captive-bred alligators within 26 small protected reserves (2). Any wild populations that remain are severely fragmented and almost none exist in their natural habitat (2). However the Chinese government has recently allocated funds to create new habitats with a view to introduce captive-bred alligators into the wild in three other provinces (2). This encouraging step needs the support of local people to make it a success; they will need to be convinced of the worth of living together with this ancient species that may have been associated with the mythical Chinese dragon. , ,protected; ,0,1582,Chinese crested-tern; Chinese-crested tern; Matsu tern,Sterna bernsteini,Chinese crested tern (Sterna bernsteini),Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Charadriiformes,Laridae,Sterna (1),Length: 42 cm (2),The specific threats facing this exceptionally rare bird have not yet been identified but a range of environmental issues are known to affect other species within its range and are therefore highly plausible threats to the Chinese crested tern (4). Offshore islets which appear to be the key nesting areas of this species are thought to be relatively safe from human disturbance. However other coastal wetlands in the Chinese crested tern\xe2\x80\x99s presumed breeding range in eastern China have been affected by large-scale development projects (4) (6). Seabirds are also hunted and exploited for food in China. Indeed the main threat to the newly discovered population on the Mazu Dao islands is from fishermen from mainland China who visit the nesting islets to collect seashells and bird eggs. Other potential threats include the introduction of rats and cats to currently predator-free offshore islands oil pollution and contamination of estuarine areas by industrial and agricultural pollutants and human disturbance (6).,The Mazu Dao islands were declared as the National Matzu Nature Reserve for Terns in 2000 offering some protection to the birds there (4) (6). The most recent sighting of the Chinese crested tern in China was from Huanghe Sanjiaozhou Nature Reserve in Shandong in 1991 and several other protected areas exist along the Chinese coast where this species may occur (4). The Chinese crested tern is nationally protected in China and Thailand and the area where it was once recorded in Thailand is protected as the Laem Talumphuk Non-Hunting Area (4) (6). Further studies are certainly needed to better understand this species including its range what sort of breeding success it is having the exact threats it faces and its protection needs (7). One suggested measure which has been successful elsewhere is to give local people a vested interest in seeing the terns remain alive perhaps by allowing or encouraging fishermen to take birdwatchers to see the rare seabirds rather than collecting their eggs (7). Thus special boat trips have now been made available from Matsu Island to the National Matsu Nature Reserve for Terns during the months of June and July for NT$350 (approx. US$11). Landing on the nesting island is not permitted and viewing is from the boat at a safe distance so that the terns are not disturbed but this revenue may help protect the Chinese crested tern by making it more valuable alive than dead (5). ,environmental;environment;pollution; ,protected; ,3,1583,Chinese salamander,Andrias davidianus,Chinese giant salamander (Andrias davidianus),Animalia,Chordata,Amphibia,Caudata,Cryptobranchidae,Andrias (1),Length: 1.8 m (2),The Chinese giant salamander is threatened by hunting as its flesh is considered a delicacy in Asia. Other threats include habitat alteration and loss; deforestation causes soil erosion and increased runoff and silting in rivers. The building of dams in China over the years has also changed the natural river flow in some areas where the Chinese giant salamander is found. Local pesticides fertilizers and pollutants are also thought to affect the health of this amphibian though little research has been conducted. Symptoms of these recent threats include the lower numbers of Chinese giant salamanders recorded with smaller populations and also smaller individuals (4).,The Chinese giant salamander is now protected from international trade by its listing on Appendix I of the Convention of International Trade of Endangered Species (CITES) (3). Since the 1980s 14 nature reserves with a total area of more than 355000 hectares have been established for the conservation of the Chinese giant salamander (7). This includes a huge 99975 hectare area of Mount Wuyi China which was designated as a World Heritage Site in 1999 dedicated to conserving this biodiverse region including the habitat of this salamander (8). The surrounding area has a growing population and the establishment of this reserve will protect many species.

The Chinese pangolin has been intensively hunted for its meat which is considered a delicacy as well as for its skin and scales which have been used to scratch mosquito bites due to their supposed antiseptic properties or ground into a powder which is believed to have aphrodisiac properties and an ability to cure for skin diseases (4) (6). Due to it being more terrestrial than other Asian pangolin species it has been easier to hunt and is now very rare in some countries of its range such as Vietnam and Lao PDR (1). Hunting is the main threat to the Chinese pangolin as disturbance of its habitat has not been shown to have a large impact provided its food source of termites and ants are not lost (1). \xa0,The Chinese pangolin is legally protected in the majority of countries it resides in including Bangladesh China Taiwan Thailand and India. It also occurs in some protected areas but unfortunately these measures have not been sufficient in reducing the illegal hunting and trade that takes place (1). While large seizures of illegally caught Chinese pangolins do occur greater enforcement of laws and improved management of protected areas are required to prevent this devastating hunting (1). ,hunting;disease; ,protected; ,2,1585,Asian three-striped box turtle; golden coin turtle,Cuora trifasciata,Chinese three-striped box turtle (Cuora trifasciata),Animalia,Chordata,Reptilia,Testudines,Bataguridae,Cuora (1),Carapace length: up to 20 cm (2),Turtles and tortoises across Southeast Asia have undergone massive declines in recent years due to overexploitation for the Southern Asian particularly Chinese food markets (9). Although having been hunted by local people for subsistence for centuries recent changes in Asian economics have opened up direct access to foreign markets in which turtles and tortoises are favoured for their meat and perceived medicinal value (10). The Chinese three-striped box turtle has suffered particularly badly because of recent claims that its <strong>plastron</strong> contains medicinal properties that can cure cancer which has driven up the demand and therefore price bringing this species to the edge of extinction (2). Additionally this rare turtle is highly sought after by the pet trade with adults fetching up to US$3000 each (6) (9). Such a high market value inevitably leads to over-collection from the wild. Indeed some Chinese can attain enough money to build a house from the sale of a single adult Chinese three-striped box turtle an extremely powerful incentive (6).,In 2001 a programme on the conservation of wild fauna and flora and the establishment of nature reserves was begun in China. Many new nature reserves have been created some of which offer habitat for tortoises and freshwater turtles (11). This species is protected by law in Hong Kong under the Wild Animals Protection Ordinance Cap. 170. under which collection of any wild turtles is prohibited unless under a special permit obtained from the Agricultural Fisheries and Conservation Department (7). Individuals employed by the Agricultural Fisheries and Conservation Department of Hong Kong also patrol protected territories to curb illegal hunting of native tortoises and freshwater turtles (11). Various captive breeding programmes for this species exist around the world (12) but this Department is also implementing a captive breeding project with a local conservation organisation that includes plans for subsequent reintroductions into the wild (11). ,pet; ,captive breeding;protected; ,1,2586,Andrew's or Christmas Island frigatebird,Fregata andrewsi,Christmas frigatebird (Fregata andrewsi),Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Pelecaniformes,Fregatidae,Fregata (1),Length: 89 - 100 cm (2),Habitat destruction and human predation have been the major causes of population decline in the past (6); dust pollution from phosphate mine driers caused one major nesting site to be abandoned (4). Dust suppression equipment has since been installed and human predation has ceased since this species has been protected (4). Birds that have been displaced in the past may now be using sub-optimal habitat which could pose a threat to their survival (4). The Christmas frigatebird is confined to a few breeding <strong>colonies</strong> on a single island and this together with their low reproductive rate (4) makes the population alarmingly vulnerable to any chance event.,Christmas Island National Park was established in 1989 and contains two of the three current breeding populations of this species\xa0(5). Christmas frigatebirds are also protected outside of the park and by Migratory Bird Agreements between Australia and other countries (4).

The decline of this species has been attributed mostly to pollution from agricultural run-off and to the alteration of waterways (4) (7) with the clubshell pearly mussel being particularly sensitive to siltation (4).,The clubshell pearly mussel is federally listed as \xe2\x80\x98Endangered\xe2\x80\x99 in the United States (4) (7) and is classified as \xe2\x80\x98Endangered\xe2\x80\x99 in Illinois Indiana Michigan and Ohio (2).

These fish are accidentally caught on lines whilst local fisherman search the deep waters for other species (6). Due to the likely slow reproduction rate and small number of offspring of coelacanths the species is possibly particularly vulnerable to the removal of pregnant females from the population (6).,The coelacanth is protected from international trade by its listing on Appendix I of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) (1). Fishermen of the Grand Comoro Island have also imposed a voluntary ban on fishing in areas where coelacanths (or \xe2\x80\x98gombessa\xe2\x80\x99 as they are known locally) exist (5) in a vital effort to save their country\xe2\x80\x99s most unique fauna. The Coelacanth Rescue Mission is also distributing Deep Release Kits to local fishermen which provide an effective method of returning accidentally caught fish to their deep habitat (3).

The forest areas in which it now exists are so fragmented it is believed that they are too small to maintain the tamarin populations (3). Sadly the continuous expansion of human settlement in northern Colombia has brought the cotton-headed tamarin more bad luck. With easier access to the tamarin\xe2\x80\x99s habitat animal collectors trap these small monkeys and sell them in port cities either for export or local trade (10). Populations in the past have also suffered from the export of significant numbers for biomedical research in the 1960s and 1970s (5) (9).,The cotton-headed tamarin has been\xa0protected in Colombia since 1969 and export of this species has been banned since 1974 (1).\xa0However its numbers have continued to dwindle away as has its habitat and hope of survival.

Habitat destruction continues to encroach on the marshes where this species is found and competition with introduced and <strong>hybrid</strong> species poses further threats to survival (5).,Recent reports indicated that population numbers of the Cuban crocodile are showing signs of recovery; the population in the Zapata swamp is estimated at between 3000 and 6000 individuals (6). Active measures are underway to ensure this population remains well protected but a further important conservation priority is the establishment of an alternative wild population (5). In the 1950s to 60s thousands of Cuban crocodiles were taken into captivity to be farmed for their skins and the population of captive animals is today substantial one farm has recently been given CITES (Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species) approval to trade internationally (6). ,pet; ,cites;protected; ,1,2595,Cumberland bean; Purple bean,Villosa trabalis,Cumberland bean pearly mussel (Villosa trabalis),Animalia,Mollusca,Bivalvia,Unionoida,Unionidae,Villosa (1),Length: up to 5.5 cm (2),Historically the Cumberland bean pearly mussel inhabited ten river systems but now occupies only four (3). Unfortunately like many other species of mussel the Cumberland bean pearly mussel is under threat due to human activities namely siltation channelization and water pollution such as from toxic chemical spills and run-off from urban and agricultural areas (8). Being a filter feeder the Cumberland bean pearly mussel must have exceptionally clean water to feed reproduce and respire thus any pollution or siltation seriously jeopardises the mussel\xe2\x80\x99s chance of survival as the water becomes dirty or poisonous. In addition channelization destroys suitable river habitats changing the dynamics of the water downstream so that it is no longer suitable for the mussel (2). Population numbers are hard to estimate as little data are available; however it is thought that there are around 1000 to 2000 individuals left in the wild meaning that this species has suffered a decline of around 75 to 90 percent since it was first discovered (4).,This species was first listed as Endangered by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service in June 1976 and a conservation plan was approved in August 1984. The aims of the recovery plan are to re-establish the Cumberland bean pearly mussel within two river systems that were formerly part of its range and to prevent the loss or degradation of existing habitats (4) (8). It is essential for more research to be carried out on the life history of this mysterious mussel including studies to identify the host fish species of the <strong>larvae</strong> to understand how to rear the species in a laboratory to aid with reintroduction and to identify potential habitats for reintroduction (4). ,pollution; , ,1,0596,Scalesia,Scalesia divisa,Daisy tree (Scalesia divisa),Plantae,Tracheophyta,Magnoliopsida,Asterales,Asteraceae,Scalesia (1),Max height: 4 m (2),Since humans arrived on the Galapagos dramatic ecological changes have been caused by agricultural activities exploitation of native species and the introduction of non-native animals and plants (7). Consequently many species of <i>Scalesia</i> are now under significant threat of extinction. For <i>Scalesia</i> <i>divisa</i> the greatest concern is introduced goats which have caused extensive damage to the few remaining populations (1) (4).,Scientists at the Charles Darwin Research Station are involved in several projects to restore and preserve populations of <i>Scalesia </i>species including those on San Crist\xc3\xb3bal (4).

Now additional threat comes from habitat loss due to <strong>desertification</strong> as well as overgrazing by livestock and the loss of tree cover following clearance by man (13) (12). The livestock not only cause drier land but also drive the gazelle away. Civil unrest in several of the countries home to this once numerous gazelle has also contributed to its decline (12).,The range of the dama gazelle falls on some of the poorest countries in Africa and consequently little action is being taken to conserve this species.

The greatest threat to this species\xe2\x80\x99 survival on the mainland is probably the presence of unleashed dogs in Nahuelbuta National Park which may attack the foxes and also have the potential to transmit diseases. Despite dogs being prohibited from the park they are often allowed in with visitors and subsequently let loose (1). Many foxes have become habituated to humans through unrestricted feeding by visitors and spend much of their time under vehicles in the car park where they are at risk of being killed by visitors\xe2\x80\x99 cars (2). The larger island population appears relatively safer with Chilo\xc3\xa9 National Park encompassing most of the still untouched rainforest of the island and containing a sizeable fox population. However surrounding areas also containing foxes are suffering from ongoing logging forest fragmentation and poaching by locals (1). Some foxes have been persecuted by farmers on the island for killing their poultry and attacks from dogs also pose a threat here (2).,Darwin\xe2\x80\x99s fox has been protected by Chilean law since 1929 but enforcement can be difficult and some poaching unfortunately continues (1). Research and monitoring of this species is ongoing being undertaken by initiatives such as Darwin\xe2\x80\x99s Fox Research and Conservation Project which also seeks to raise awareness amongst schools dog owners farmers and loggers of the plight of the fox and the dangers that imperil it (5). The 430 square kilometre Chilo\xc3\xa9 National Park protects much of the island population and the smaller 68 square kilometre Nahuelbuta National Park protects the mainland population. However a number of foxes at Nahuelbuta are known to move to lower unprotected areas during the winter in search of milder conditions where they become more vulnerable to mortality. It has therefore been recommended that the park be expanded to protect the foxes that use these areas (1). However it is also essential that Park wardens become stricter about enforcing Park rules. Dogs brought in by visitors pose a serious threat whilst continuous feeding of the foxes has habituated them to humans and thereby made them ever more vulnerable to the dangers people bring. Indeed it has been suggested that if current relaxed attitudes continue in Nahuelbuta National Park Chilo\xc3\xa9 National Park may become the only long-term safe area for this rare <strong>endemic</strong> fox (2). ,fragmentation;poaching;disease; ,protected; ,3,1600,Antanosy day gecko,Phelsuma antanosy,Day gecko (Phelsuma antanosy),Animalia,Chordata,Reptilia,Squamata,Gekkonidae,Phelsuma (1),Snout-vent length: 3.3 - 4.8 cm (2),Occupying an area thought to be no more than nine square kilometres the day gecko is threatened by further loss of its habitat. This extremely rare gecko has a highly fragmented distribution making it vulnerable to any detrimental activities within what little habitat remains (1). One small population is likely to be lost within the next 25 years as mining activity is planned in part of Sainte Luce while many other populations are under continual threat from local communities exploiting the forest\xe2\x80\x99s resources (1). Indeed the day gecko is suspected to have become extinct in Petriky Forest due to tree felling for timber fuel and conversion to agricultural land (2). This highly specialised species is also threatened by the selective removal of <em>Pandus</em> trees (1).\xa0,The Ambatotsirongorongo Forest which supports a large proportion of the remaining day gecko population is encompassed by a newly created protected area. Five forest fragments at Sainte Luce in which the day gecko is also found are also managed within a community resource use agreement which aims to protect the local people\xe2\x80\x99s livelihoods whilst conserving biodiversity (1). However the successful management of these areas will very much depend on the support of the local people and the abandonment of destructive activities such as slash-and-burn agriculture and hunting (7).

Bach Ma National Park lies within the historical range of this species and a poster campaign to obtain local information was conducted there in 1996 and 1997 but as yet there have been no confirmed records from this park. In December 2003 the captive population numbered 1033 individuals (6). A studbook was first developed in the 1960s and abandoned in the 1970s owing to lack of resources but efforts were renewed in the 1990s (7) and an international studbook now helps coordinate breeding to ensure that the captive population stays genetically healthy (5). Although there have been problems with <strong>inbreeding</strong> and <strong>hybridisation</strong> in captivity screening is thankfully helping eliminate hybrids from much of the captive stock (6). Having long been thought extinct (5) Edwards\xe2\x80\x99s pheasant now clings to a precarious existence and it is imperative that the rampant deforestation is stopped and conservation efforts kept up if this rare pheasant is to be saved from the very real possibility of extinction it now faces (6). ,hunting; , ,1,0607,Kleinmanní¢ŒóŒ»s tortoise; Leithí¢ŒóŒ»s tortoise,Testudo kleinmanni,Egyptian tortoise (Testudo kleinmanni),Animalia,Chordata,Reptilia,Testudines,Testudinidae,Testudo (1),Carapace length: 14.4 cm (2),The main threats endangering the Egyptian tortoise are intensive commercial collection and habitat destruction leading to the disappearance of the species from much of its former range (8). Agricultural expansion cultivation overgrazing and urban encroachment have put enormous pressure on the Egyptian tortoise\xe2\x80\x99s fragile and dwindling habitat dramatically reducing available vegetation for food and cover (1) (8). Additionally the species has suffered heavily in Egypt from collection for the national and international pet trade which moved its attention to Libyan stock after Egyptian subpopulations were harvested to extinction. Trade in this species also exists in Libya itself which is a major concern for the future of the remaining world population (1).,The Egyptian tortoise is protected by law in Egypt but not in Libya. Additionally the tortoise is listed under Appendix I of CITES prohibiting international trade in the species. However these protective laws are evidently often flouted. Protected areas exist in Egypt including the one in which the two individuals were found in 2001 but there is little benefit of this protection or indeed motivation to establish new protected areas for the species since it is effectively extinct in Egypt. This tortoise may also occur in Kouf National Park in northeast Libya where one specimen was found 20 years ago but no other reserves exist in the species\xe2\x80\x99 known range. The establishment of more protected areas in Libya would be of enormous benefit to the Egyptian tortoise and greatly enhance its chances of survival. Although tracts of suitable habitat still remain in Libya there is an all too realistic possibility that the Egyptian tortoise could face extinction in less than 20 years if habitat degradation and trade cannot be stopped (1). ,pet; ,cites;protected; ,1,2608,River pipefish,Syngnathus watermeyeri,Estuarine pipefish (Syngnathus watermeyeri),Animalia,Chordata,Actinopterygii,Syngnathiforms,Syngnathidae,Syngnathus (1),Length: up to 13 cm (2),The loss of this species from the majority of its former range has been attributed to altered river systems caused by the construction of upstream dams. These developments restrict the supply of fresh water that brings with it essential nutrients required by the <strong>phytoplankton</strong> upon which the food chain depends (5). Much excitement greeted the discovery of an additional population of this pipefish in the East Kleinemonde Estuary but these fish are under increasing threat and not least because they are the last remaining members of the species (6). Developments along the river have led to silting problems; the creation of artificial beaches and the removal of reed beds have further threatened the delicate estuary ecosystem (6).,With the discovery of the remnant population of this species in 1996 the Western District Council adopted a management plan to protect this rare pipefish (6). Measures included a public awareness programme and the discouragement of powerboat riding. Unfortunately the plan has been poorly enforced and illegal developments along with an increase in planned developments have proliferated in the area (6). Unless stricter measures are bought into effect quickly it is likely that the river pipefish will become extinct once more this time with no reprieve. ,loss; , ,1,0609,common eel,Anguilla anguilla,European eel (Anguilla anguilla),Animalia,Chordata,Actinopterygii,Anguilliformes,Anguillidae,Anguilla (1),Length: up to 1 m (2),The population of the European eel is threatened at present and eel stocks have declined in recent years. However there is currently very little scientific knowledge of this species which would aid its management.

The main threat to survival of the crested iguana however comes from habitat destruction. Particular devastation is caused by introduced goats which were brought to Fiji in an effort improve the quality of life of local people (5). Goats have been released on fairly uninhabited islands where they graze on native trees and shrubs making these tropical paradises uninhabitable for iguanas (5).,The National Trust for Fiji (assisted by Taronga Zoo Sydney and the Kula Eco Park in Fiji) has worked for many years to preserve this enigmatic lizard (5). Yaduataba Island was cleared of goats in 1981 and declared a national sanctuary; today it is home to several thousand crested iguanas (5). A three year Fijian Crested Iguana Project has also been formulated by the Taronga Zoo Kula Eco Park Fijian National Trust and other organisations (8).

The population of flapper skates has seen a drastic decline in European waters following this intensive fishing pressure. Although no longer targeted in the majority of areas as the population is too low these fish are still threatened by fisheries <strong>bycatch</strong> (2).,Further research on the distribution of the species and the monitoring of life-cycles growth and so on will also need to be undertaken in order to successfully manage the recovery of this fish (2). ,fishing; , ,1,0615,Flat-backed spider tortoise; kapidolo; Madagascar flat-shelled tortoise; Malagasy flat-tailed tortoise,Pyxis planicauda,Flat-shelled spider tortoise (Pyxis planicauda),Animalia,Chordata,Reptilia,Testudines,Testudinidae,Pyxis (1),Carapace length: up to 13.4 cm (2)Male weight: 300 í¢ŒóŒñ 400 g (2)Female weight: 475 í¢ŒóŒñ 670 g (2),Like Madagascar\xe2\x80\x99s other tortoises the flat-shelled spider tortoise has been severely threatened by rampant degradation of its habitat and harvesting for the international pet trade (2).

Pollution from mining forestry agricultural and industrial chemicals and residential sewage is thought to be responsible for the high levels of shell erosion and infections recently observed in this species as well as reducing numbers of <strong>molluscs</strong> and other <strong>invertebrates</strong> on which the species feeds (2). Excessive sediment accumulation (siltation) also appears to be having a dramatic impact on this small turtle possibly through smothering <strong>molluscs</strong> and other <strong>invertebrate</strong> food sources altering the habitat where this turtle seeks food and cover and accumulating heavy metals and chemical toxins (2) (3). In the 1970s and 80s commercial collecting for the pet trade further reduced some populations with large collections having been recorded and individuals advertised in several places for over 80 U.S. dollars each (2) (3) (4). It is also hard for flattened musk turtle populations to recover from any adverse changes due to its slowness to mature and low reproductive rate (see \xe2\x80\x98Biology\xe2\x80\x99) (2).,A bill passed by the Alabama legislature in May 1984 prohibits the taking of this species from the wild and may be a deterrent to commercial overexploitation in the future (9).

Its original extinction from Floreana was probably a combination of several factors including the introduction of black rats (<i>Rattus rattus</i>) and the loss of <i>Opuntia </i>habitat brought about by invasive herbivores (2) (3) (5). In contrast declines recorded in the two remaining satellite populations in some years are thought to be being primarily driven by an increase in the frequency of dry <strong>La Ni\xc3\xb1a</strong> years which lead to high levels of adult mortality (2) (5) (12). Due to its isolation since the extinction of the main population on Floreana Island the Champion population has lost a significant amount of genetic diversity and given its precariously small size is in a severely vulnerable state (2) (11). Fortunately the population on Gardner still contains a higher number of individuals and relatively high levels of genetic diversity (11). However a single extreme weather event or newly introduced predators could easily decimate the entire surviving population. This is not to mention the ever present spectre of an avian disease spreading to the mockingbird population or the introduction of the black rat from neighbouring Floreana (2) (5) (11).,In 2008 the Charles Darwin Foundation in collaboration with several other international organisations set out an emergency management plan to preserve the imperilled Floreana mockingbird by reintroducing it to its original home on Floreana. This bold scheme is expected to be carried out in phases over a period of approximately ten years. The initial phase will involve eradicating all introduced species from Floreana and developing a program to breed mockingbirds in captivity. This will be followed by the first release trials of wild or captive bred birds and finally the supervision and monitoring of the released population (11) (12). It is hoped that the first phases of the reintroduction will be started in 2009 the bicentenary of the birth of Charles Darwin (12) (13). ,loss;invasive;disease; , ,3,0619,forest little owl; forest spotted owlet,Heteroglaux blewitti,Forest owlet (Heteroglaux blewitti),Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Strigiformes,Strigidae,Heteroglaux (1),Length: 23cm (2),A fragmented population of between 100 and 250 forest owlets is believed to be left in the wild (2).

The\xa0<strong>deciduous forest</strong>\xa0on which the entire population relies has been severely exploited and the reduction of this habitat is thought to be the predominant strain on the surviving population. The degradation of the habitat is the result of local illegal tree felling for firewood and timber and also to provide space for farming and for new settlements (2).,Since its rediscovery research has been carried out to better understand the forest owlet.

Despite these efforts between 1997 and 2006 the wild population declined by 58 percent from 436 to just 182 breeding adults (1). Habitat loss and degradation poses the biggest threat to this species\xe2\x80\x99 survival as the human population explosion of the Indian subcontinent continues to encroach on the river systems where it is found (5). Dams irrigation projects sand mining and artificial embankments have all encroached on the gharial\xe2\x80\x99s habitat reducing its range to just two percent of what it was (1). In addition fishing removes important food sources and can cause clashes with fishermen leading to accidental or deliberate death. Eggs are collected for medicinal properties and adult males are hunted due to the belief that the snout has aphrodisiac effects (5).,Gharial population levels reached a catastrophic low in the 1970s prompting a massive rescue campaign (4). Restocking programmes involving captive breeding and ranching (wild eggs reared in captivity and then re-released) were established in India in 1975 and Nepal in 1978 and these worked to gradually bring this species back from the brink of extinction (5). However in recent years the population has suffered another devastating decline and in 2006 less than 200 breeding adults remained in the wild (1). The current decline indicates that no matter how many gharials are released into the wild habitat degradation and hunting need to be prevented to ensure the species\xe2\x80\x99 survival. Consequently the focus of current conservation efforts is moving away from captive breeding programmes towards other initiatives such as the protection of gharial habitat enforcement of the species\xe2\x80\x99 protected status and the education and involvement of local people in the species\xe2\x80\x99 conservation.

However its overall population is relatively small between 2000 and 4000 individuals (4) (12) and is restricted to a single tiny island where its habitat is under threat from deforestation and burning (1) (4) (11). Its population is believed to have decreased in recent decades exacerbated by the removal of snakes from the island for the illegal wild animal trade (4) (11) (12) (13).,<i><em>Bothropoides</em></i> species are highly venomous and are considered to be particularly dangerous to humans as a group being responsible for about 90 percent of all serious snakebites in South America (6).

This little-known frog is further threatened by the over-collecting of specimens and of bromeliads (1). In addition declines in the population at Cerro del Aripo may be attributed to the chytrid fungus <em>Batrachochytrium</em> a disease causing fungi that is inflicting dramatic declines upon <strong>amphibian</strong> populations worldwide (2).\xa0,As this rare frog has an extremely limited range there is a pressing need to protect the golden tree frog\xe2\x80\x99s habitat. The importance of this is increased by the species\xe2\x80\x99 specialisation upon a single bromeliad species (1). El Tucuche is managed as a game reserve and access to the mountain requires government permission; however policing this legislation has proved challenging (2). Consequently in the absence of specific conservation measures the extent and quality of its habitat is continuing to dwindle (1) (2). ,disease; , ,1,0632,Gough finch,Rowettia goughensis,Gough bunting (Rowettia goughensis),Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Emberizidae,Rowettia (1),Size: 18cm (2),This bird\xe2\x80\x99s occurrence in a restricted habitat of one very small island makes it extremely vulnerable to natural disasters like fires and hurricanes or to introduced diseases and especially to the accidental introduction of non-native predators (3). Indeed the introduced house mouse <i>Mus musculus </i>poses the greatest present threat through competition and predation (2). Buntings are found at low density in lowland areas where mice are abundant (2) and experiments with \xe2\x80\x98dummy\xe2\x80\x99 eggs imply that mouse predation on their nests is very high (5). Thus researchers think the bird may have been forced by these mice from the best nesting sites into less suitable upland regions (5). Over the last 15 years the proportion of juveniles in the population has declined from 50% to 20% this appears to indicate that there are now too few young surviving to reproductive age to sustain the population.,Gough Island is both a Nature Reserve and World Heritage Site and while this provides good protection from human disturbance it does not offer the Gough bunting any protection from the mouse predation that is driving it towards extinction (2). A study of the mice conducted by The Royal Society for the Protection of Birds (RSPB) and funded by the UK government's Overseas Territories Environment Programme has shown that their eradication from the island is feasible. Unfortunately however until adequate funding from the UK government is supplied this will not occur (6). Gough Island is widely recognised as having one of the most diverse bird colonies in the world including four endangered species and every effort should therefore be made to protect it and the rich biodiversity it hosts (7). ,disease;pet; , ,2,0633,Avutarda India; Avutarda í€Œndica,Ardeotis nigriceps,Great Indian bustard (Ardeotis nigriceps),Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Gruiformes,Otididae,Ardeotis (1),Male length: 122 cm (2)Female length: 92 cm (2),The great Indian bustard has become extinct in almost 90 percent\xa0of its former range principally as a result of loss of habitat and poaching (6). The conversion of the land for agriculture and widespread hunting which became more prevalent with the onset of vehicle transport have both contributed to the precipitous decline in this species (2).,The great Indian bustard is listed in Schedule I of the Wildlife (Protection) Act of 1972 in India and international trade is prohibited by its listing on Appendix I of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) (5). A number of sanctuaries have been set up with the aim of preserving this species; however this may not be the most effective means of conservation as population numbers have continued to decline. The Bombay Natural History Society (BNHS) is urging the Indian Government to adopt a \xe2\x80\x98Project Bustard\xe2\x80\x99 scheme along the same lines of \xe2\x80\x98Project Tiger\xe2\x80\x99 (5).

Major threats to survival come from illegal trade in the turtle's prized shell known as tortoiseshell which has been sought for jewellery and ornaments for centuries. There is also a substantial market for eggs meat and even stuffed juveniles as exotic gifts in some parts of the world (10). Additional pressure on the global population comes from harvests to support traditional customs the loss of nesting sites accidental entanglement in fishing lines and the deterioration of coral reef systems which act as feeding sites for these turtles (11).,International trade in the hawksbill turtle is banned amongst signatory nations by its listing on Appendix I of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) (3)\xa0but extensive illegal trafficking still occurs. Preventing this black market trade is the key to saving this species and TRAFFIC (the wildlife trade monitoring network) is involved in monitoring and highlighting this problem (14).

Poisons used for pest control seem to be inadvertently affecting the lizard population (7).,Plans for conservation of this species are not extensive.  The United Nations and the Canary Islands Autonomous Government funded a program for the captive breeding and <strong>re-introduction</strong> of the Hierro giant lizard to its original natural habitat.

Competition with cattle severe drought disease and poaching are all factors that have contributed to devastating hirola populations (3) (4).\xa0Unfortunately the hirola\xe2\x80\x99s preference for areas that are used by livestock puts them at increased risk from diseases like rinderpest and tuberculosis (3).,In 1963 10 to 20 hirola were released into Tsavo East National Park Kenya which grew to a population of 79 individuals by 1996.

Additionally this iguana is threatened by local subsistence hunting and predation from introduced carnivores such as dogs cats and mongooses. Hunting for Hispaniolan ground iguanas for food and trade has increased gradually since the mid 1970s this species at one time being served at oriental restaurants in Santo Domingo as a speciality dish (1).,International trade in the Hispaniolan ground iguana is controlled by its listing under Appendix I of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) (3). Compliance with CITES trade regulations is largely effective although occasional smuggling of animals across the Haitian border does still occur. Enforcement of national protective legislation in the Dominican Republic has improved in the last few years but fails to go far enough since clearing of natural habitat for development is neither being prevented nor regulated and illegal hunting for food and the local pet market continues (1). However the Isla Cabritos range which used to be intensively exploited for hardwood cutting charcoal and livestock grazing has undergone extensive natural regeneration in the last 15 years and improved protective management since 1992 has meant present conditions there are stable (4). Indianapolis Zoo has had a small but successful captive breeding programme although survivorship of young has been low (1) and there are plans to re-establish new breeding colonies at both the Parque Zoologico Nacional (ZooDom) in the Dominican Republic and the Indianapolis Zoo (4).

Whilst myxomatosis is not such a threat today a new disease that arrived in Spain in 1988 known as Rabbit Haemorrhagic Disease is once again threatening rabbit numbers (1)\xa0(3) (5). Despite protection measures and heavy fines illegal hunting continues and the accidental killing of lynx in rabbit traps traps set for smaller carnivores or with poisoned fox bait together with road fatalities are some of the major causes of mortality at present (3) (5).\xa0,"The Iberian lynx is legally protected in both <st1:country-region w:st=""on"">Spain</st1:country-region> and <st1:country-region w:st=""on""><st1:place w:st=""on"">Portugal</st1:place></st1:country-region> (1) and is also listed on Appendix I of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) meaning international trade in the species is prohibited (4).

The unnaturally high death toll was thought to be caused by a fatal virus but testing has revealed that vultures are suffering from kidney failure following the consumption of cattle that had previously been treated with the anti-inflammatory drug diclofenac (2). In fact the decline is a result of a lethal level of the drug in a small proportion of the <strong>ungulate</strong> carcasses available to vultures but as vultures travel long distances to reach <strong>carrion</strong> a considerable proportion of the population has been affected (7). The full extent of the decline of <i>Gyps</i> vulture species is already being felt by humans as rotting carcasses remain untouched posing a health hazard as well as encouraging feral dog populations which carry rabies (8).,It is considered necessary to prevent exposure of vultures to livestock carcasses that have been contaminated with diclofenac and to find an alternative replacement drug (7). Government commitment to the control of the use of the drug is crucial but until it has been entirely removed from the environment a collaboration of bird protection organisations plan to take all vultures into captivity for the next 20 to 30 years to avoid further deaths which would further reduce the chance of a successful recovery of this already rare species (8). , , ,0,0652,California Channel Island fox; Channel Islands fox; island gray fox; island grey fox,Urocyon littoralis,Island fox (Urocyon littoralis),Animalia,Chordata,Mammalia,Carnivora,Canidae,Urocyon (1),1.3 - 2.5 kg (2),Numbers of island foxes declined at alarming rates since 1994 with four of the six subspecies declining by as much as 95 percent. The primary threats causing these devastating declines were predation by golden eagles (<i>Aquila chrysaetos</i>) on the northern Channel Islands canine distemper virus (CDV) on Santa Catalina Island and collision with vehicles on San Clemente and San Nicolas Islands (2) (8).,The island fox is listed by the state of California as a threatened species (1) and the islands themselves also receive protection. Santa Rosa San Miguel and Santa Cruz are part of the Channel Islands National Park which is protected by the U.S National Park Service and the western portion of Santa Cruz Island is also protected by The Nature Conservancy. Dogs and cats are prohibited from being brought into the Channel Islands National Park in order to prevent infections from being transmitted to the foxes (6). Santa Catalina Island is owned and managed by the Catalina Island Conservancy (14) and the remaining two islands San Nicolas and San Clemente are owned and managed by the U.S. Navy (1). ,environmental;environment;disease; ,captive breeding;protected; ,3,2653,Jamaican iguana; Jamaican rock iguana,Cyclura collei,Jamaican ground iguana (Cyclura collei),Animalia,Chordata,Reptilia,Squamata,Iguanidae,Cyclura (1),up to 9 kg (3) (4),Traditionally the Jamaican ground iguana was hunted for meat which caused declines in its population in the 19th century (11). Today this species is significantly affected by invasive non-native predators including mongooses cats pigs and stray dogs which eat juvenile iguanas or destroy nests (1) (2) (6) (9) (12).,Much has now been done to try and save the Jamaican ground iguana and this rare lizard is now a flagship species for conservation in the West Indies (6). The Jamaican ground iguana is listed on Appendix I of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) which prohibits international trade in this species (5) and it is also listed as \xe2\x80\x98Endangered\xe2\x80\x99 on the U.S. Endangered Species Act (14).

The principal threat to Jerdon\xe2\x80\x99s courser is loss and degradation of habitat.\xa0 Inhabiting scrub forest bordering villages and agricultural land it is vulnerable to the effects of livestock overgrazing firewood collecting forest clearing for agriculture bird trapping and direct human disturbance. Extensive areas of suitable habitat have also been lost through quarrying and mining (5) (6). Between 1991 and 2000 an estimated 11 to 15 percent of suitable habitat was lost while forest patches became smaller and fragmented (9). Furthermore the construction in 2005 of the Telugu-Ganga Canal resulted in the loss of Jerdon\xe2\x80\x99s courser habitat and the destruction of one newly-discovered site for the species (6). The recent construction of the Somasilla dam resulted in the relocation of 57 villages to the Lankamalai region bordering Jerdon\xe2\x80\x99s courser habitat. This is expected to increase the disturbances on Jerdon\xe2\x80\x99s courser habitat as the settlers are dependant on the forests for resources such as firewood and livestock grazing (4).\xa0\xa0\xa0,As a direct result of the re-discovery of Jerdon\xe2\x80\x99s courser the Lankamalleswara Wildlife Sanctuary was established with the aims of protecting the species and its habitat (6). Since 2001 the Bombay Natural History Society in collaboration with the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds and the Universities of Cambridge and Reading have been working to determine the distribution and habitat requirements of the species. The application of tracking strips camera traps and audio-playback methodologies have successfully identified new locations for Jerdon\xe2\x80\x99s courser investigated habitat usage and evaluated threats (7) (8). Lobbying against the construction of the Telugu-Ganga canal through the Jerdon\xe2\x80\x99s courser's range successfully avoided further habitat destruction and fragmentation in 1986 but in 2005 the canal project recommenced and resulted in the destruction of some Jerdon\xe2\x80\x99s Courser habitat. However although canal construction proceeded the route was modified to make it less damaging and 1000 hectares of additional land were acquired by the Andhra Pradesh Forest Department in compensation (6) (10). If Jerdon\xe2\x80\x99s courser can be restored on this degraded land the future prospects of the species can be improved (5). Further proposed measures include a radio-telemetry study to determine ecological requirements for the species and the initiation of conservation awareness programmes amongst local communities to minimise habitat loss and alteration (4). ,loss; , ,1,0655,Colibrí€Œ_ de Juan Ferní€Œçndez,Sephanoides fernandensis,Juan Ferní€Œçndez firecrown (Sephanoides fernandensis),Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Apodiformes,Trochilidae,Sephanoides (1),Male length: 11.5 - 12 cm (2)Female length: c. 10.5 cm (2)Male weight: 10.9 g (2)Female weight: 6.8 g (2),Population numbers of the Juan Fern\xc3\xa1ndez firecrown are thought to be in the low hundreds (1) and theJuan Fern\xc3\xa1ndez Islands are among the 11 most seriously threatened natural areas in the world as a result of hundreds of years of habitat degradation and the introduction of exotic species (4).

Because nesting occurs in such large concentrations with shallow poorly disguised nests eggs are easily exploited by human collectors (by whom they are valued for their aphrodisiac properties) and by natural predators such as coyotes (5). Today the main threat to the survival of the species comes from shrimp trawlers which often operate in areas where turtles feed turtles accidentally caught in nets (<strong>by-catch</strong>) drown to death and it is estimated that between 500 to 5000 turtles are killed in this way each year (6).,International trade in Kemp\xe2\x80\x99s ridley turtles and products is banned under their listing on Appendix I of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) and the main nesting beach has been declared a National Reserve since the 1970s (5). During the breeding season nests are protected by armed patrols and subsequently very little illegal trade occurs (2). Turtle Excluding Devices (TEDs) fitted to shrimp nets can help to prevent <strong>by-catch</strong> by allowing only shrimp-sized objects to enter the net (6). There has been an international drive to introduce these devices worldwide and shrimp trawlers operating in United States waters must now be fitted with TEDs (6). These conservation efforts have led to the slow recovery of Kemp\xe2\x80\x99s ridley turtle numbers and it has been suggested that a population goal of 10000 nesting females could be reached by 2010 (2) allowing arribadas to once again adorn the Mexican coast. , ,cites;protected; ,0,2658,Highland mangabey,Rungwecebus kipunji,Kipunji (Rungwecebus kipunji),Animalia,Chordata,Mammalia,Primates,Cercopithecidae,Rungwecebus (1) (2),Estimated male head-and-body length: 85 í¢ŒóŒñ 90 cm (1)Estimated male weight: 10 í¢ŒóŒñ 16 kg (1),The threats to the kipunji are considerable and with an estimated population of just 1117 individuals the future of this newly-discovered species is already in jeopardy (1) (3).

The bones were recovered and sent to the University of Kansas\xe2\x80\x99 Museum of Natural History but were not examined until 1982 (8).  The only significant scientific observation of the kouprey was made in 1957 when zoologist Charles Wharton studied and filmed the animal in the wild (9).  By 1970 it was thought to be extinct following continued hunting for meat and for their horns and skulls for use in traditional Chinese medicine (1) (7).  It has not been seen alive since 1988 despite aerial surveys in Cambodia in 1994 and subsequent ground surveys in Cambodia Lao PDR and Vietnam (1).  However tracks have been spotted and horns and skulls are still found for sale in Southeast Asia leading many to believe that some koupreys still exist (5) (7).  In addition to hunting habitat loss as a result of agriculture and logging activity is likely to have significantly impacted the kouprey and domestic livestock in the area could have introduced disease into the kouprey population.  Land mines along the borders of Cambodia may also be responsible for kouprey deaths and certainly hinder conservation efforts (1).,The kouprey is legally protected in all range states and may be present in some protected areas.  Prince Sihanouk designated it as the national animal of Cambodia in the 1960s partly due to its mystique (5).

Introduced species are a potential threat to the species persistence; while mammalian predators are not currently a problem on Laysan Island there is nothing to prevent an accidental introduction and there are no measures in place to deal with the event should it occur (6).  Many non-native <strong>invertebrates</strong> have arrived on Laysan and while not all are impacting the Laysan duck some (such as ants) are possibly affecting the Laysan duck\xe2\x80\x99s food supply as they compete for their terrestrial prey (4).  An introduced grass <i>Cenchrus echinatus</i> encroached on the native bunchgrass (<i>Eragrostis variabilis</i>) on Laysan Island reducing important breeding habitat but this noxious weed was thankfully eradicated from the island (13).  Infection with the parasitic nematode worm <i>Echinuria uncinata</i> is causing problems for the Laysan duck\xe2\x80\x99s precariously small population (2) and global sea level rise poses a constant threat to all species on the low-lying island of Laysan (4).,The Laysan duck is listed under Appendix I of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) and so international trade in this species is under tight control (3). Furthermore Laysan Island and Midway Atoll are under the protection of the United States Fish and Wildlife Service as they are both National Wildlife Refuges (14) and whilst there are no measures to prevent an accidental species introduction (for example via a ship wreck or unauthorised landing) Laysan Island has a quarantine for authorised visitors (6).

Currently the greatest threat appears to be the loss of its habitat. As human populations in the region rise largely due to the immigration of people from nearby areas hit by drought or tribal conflict more land is converted to permanent agriculture (4) destroying the grassland required by the lark. Between 1973 and 2002 suitable grassland habitat in the area declined by about 30 percent and in recent years more has been lost to the rapid encroachment of shrubs (4). Excessive grazing pressure and the suppression of natural seasonal fires has created favourable conditions for the encroaching shrubs (4). Finally a watering point has been developed in the centre of the Liben lark\xe2\x80\x99s range leading to an increase in livestock in the area which impacts the Liben lark through disturbance overgrazing and trampling (4).,In 2007 an expedition took place to investigate the status of the\xa0Liben lark (4) but otherwise conservation action for this Critically Endangered bird is lacking. A number of conservation measures have been recommended by the global bird conservation organisation BirdLife including further surveys and research investigations to determine what causes bushes to encroach on grassland and ascertaining the best way to protect areas of the Liben lark\xe2\x80\x99s habitat from further degradation and disturbance (4). In 2009 the IUCN upgraded the Liben lark from Endangered to Critically Endangered in light of the threats to the tiny population and it is feared that there is a real possibility of the species becoming extinct in the next few years (4). ,loss; , ,1,0670,long-billed apalis; long-billed forest-warbler; Moreauí¢ŒóŒ»s tailorbird,Artisornis moreaui,Long-billed tailorbird (Artisornis moreaui),Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Sylviidae,Artisornis (1),8 - 10 g (2),The long-billed tailorbird is under threat from forest destruction and fragmentation and although the extent of protected forest in the East Usambaras has increased in recent years unprotected forest is still under pressure from mining cultivation pole-cutting and firewood collection (3) (5) and habitat degradation still continues even within Forest Reserves (11). In 2000 the population in the Amani Nature Reserve in the East Usambaras was estimated at just 150 to 200 (4) although more recent work suggests this may be a slight underestimate (7). The population in Nilo Nature Reserve East Usambara Mountains which was initially discovered in 1996 (9) is currently being investigated and preliminary data suggest that the entire East Usambara population will be higher than previously thought (12). The population of the Njesi Plateau in Mozambique is unknown but is likely to be small (2) (3) (6).\xa0,A number of conservation efforts are underway in the East Usambaras where the long-billed tailorbird currently occurs in at least two protected areas the Amani Nature Reserve and the Nilo Nature Reserve (2) (3) (9) (11). Projects are underway to increase the amount of forest in protected areas and the Amani Nature Reserve in particular has an active conservation programme (3) (5). Additional conservation actions for the species include a population monitoring programme extensive field surveys educational programmes and the recording and monitoring of every known tailorbird <strong>territory</strong> (3). These conservation initiatives are being conducted by the Wildlife Conservation Society of Tanzania a BirdLife partner in close collaboration with the management of Amani and Nilo Nature Reserves and other stakeholders (12).\xa0 ,fragmentation; ,protected; ,1,1671,Chinchilla A Longue Queue,Chinchilla lanigera,Long-tailed chinchilla (Chinchilla lanigera),Animalia,Chordata,Mammalia,Rodentia,Chinchillidae,Chinchilla (1),Head/body length: 22.5 - 38 cm (2)Tail length: 7.5 - 15 cm (2),These small mammals have been hunted for their luxurious fur since the 1900s when around 500000 chinchilla skins were exported annually from Chile (2). At that time chinchilla populations were flourishing but their pelts were the most valuable in the world reaching up to $100000 for one alone and soon they faced extinction in the wild (5). There are currently an estimated 10000 individuals left in the Chilean mountains (6) (7). More recently populations have also suffered due to habitat destruction by the burning and harvesting of the algarobilla shrub at lower altitudes (7).,Chinchilla are protected by law in their natural habitat but it is extremely hard to monitor hunting in the remote mountain ranges of the Andes and illegal hunting does continue in some areas (6) (7). For the same reason it is also difficult to monitor the population. Recent estimates suggest this species is becoming more isolated following habitat loss and therefore less likely to be able to recover without human intervention. Reintroductions have not worked in the past though breeding is still successful in captivity and hundreds of chinchilla are bred commercially for the pet trade (2). It is hoped that conservation measures will be applied successfully to protect this species and bring it back from the brink of extinction in the wild (5). , ,protected; ,0,1672,land lobster; Lord Howe Island phasmid; Lord Howe Island stick-insect; tree lobster,Dryococelus australis,Lord Howe Island stick insect (Dryococelus australis),Animalia,Arthropoda,Insecta,Phasmida,Phasmatidae,Dryococelus (1),Male length: up to 10.6 cm (2)Female length: up to 12 cm (2),The reason for the Lord Howe Island stick insect\xe2\x80\x99s disappearance from its original habitat on Lord Howe Island was predation by rats which were accidentally introduced to the island in 1918 (1) (2) (3) (4).,Access to the Lord Howe Island stick insect\xe2\x80\x99s habitat on Ball\xe2\x80\x99s Pyramid is tightly controlled and restricted to help protect the environment (3).

It is also caught and exported illegally from Madagascar to Asia for the traditional medicine market. Furthermore land development on Madagascar is a serious threat to this turtle as it destroys its natural habitats. Clearing forests for agriculture and timber opens up Madagascar\xe2\x80\x99s untouched habitat and leads to terrible erosion. Subsequent siltation of rivers and lakes renders the turtles even more susceptible to trapping (5).,The Madagascar big-headed turtle is protected from international trade by its listing on Appendix II of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) (3). In May 2003 the Turtle Conservation Fund (TCF) released the first ever list of the world\xe2\x80\x99s top 25 endangered turtles which included the Madagascar big-headed turtle (5). The TCF intends to cover a five year \xe2\x80\x98Global Action Plan\xe2\x80\x99 that includes captive breeding and reintroduction projects trade monitoring and establishment of rescue centres local conservation plans and educational programs (5). The Durrell Wildlife Conservation Trust is also independently involved in the conservation and protection of this species (9).

However the species' small population size and fragmented distribution still leaves it vulnerable to extinction risks. Potential threats to the species' survival include habitat degradation and direct and indirect human persecution (9). Additionally the effects of behavioural traits such as poor juvenile dispersal (13) and incestuous matings (2) (14) may lead to problems of <strong>inbreeding depression</strong> (3).,The Madagascar fish-eagle is protected by its listing on Appendix II of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) (5). In 1998 Madagascar became a signatory to the International Ramsar Convention on Wetlands and a complex of four lakes in the Antsalova region were designated as a site of Wetlands of International Importance (15). These sites (known as the Manambolomaty Complex) support\xa0ten percent\xa0of the world population of Madagascar fish-eagles (9). In addition the Peregrine Fund has initiated a Madagascar Fish Eagle Conservation Programme (16) enabling detailed studies of this species as well as the initiation of a sustainability project for the local people who share their natural resources with the fish-eagles. , ,cites;protected; ,0,2675,Madagascan white-eye,Aythya innotata,Madagascar pochard (Aythya innotata),Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Anseriformes,Anatidae,Aythya (1),Length: 45 - 56 cm (2)Wingspan: 63 - 72 cm (3),The Madagascar pochard was considered relatively common at Lake Alaotra in the 1930s but declined dramatically throughout the following decades (5). The last observation at Alaotra was in 1960 and the last anywhere in 1970 until in 1991 a lone male was captured at Alaotra (11) and kept in captivity until its death a year later (2) (3) (4) (5) (7) (9). Intensive searches and publicity campaigns during the 1990s failed to find any more birds (4) (7) (9) and the Madagascar pochard was feared extinct until the rediscovery of 25 individuals at a new site in 2006 (4) (7).,Lake Alaotra was declared a Ramsar Wetland of International Importance in 2003 (15) and efforts have been underway at the site to conserve and restore the last remnants of unmodified habitat which should also benefit other threatened species. Other conservation measures have included education and awareness programmes involving local communities in environmental monitoring and continuing the search for any remaining Madagascar pochards. However the region\xe2\x80\x99s huge economic importance for agriculture and fisheries can make implementing conservation policies difficult (7) (12).

It has a restricted range and therefore is vulnerable to habitat degradation from nearby quarrying activities. It is also known to be at risk from human disturbance particularly where it grows in more accessible areas (1) (2).,The Maltese rock-centaury is legally protected by its listing on the EC Habitats Directive as a priority species affording this species some protection (1) (3). The cliffs of Malta and some on Gozo are protected locally with access only granted for scientific purposes (2). Fungus Rock is protected as a nature reserve (2).

Despite protection of nest sites this has resulted in the near complete extirpation of the species with the exception of a small number of introduced specimens (2). On Rota this species has been seriously affected by a number of threats including: forest clearance for homestead and agricultural development; direct persecution; nest predation by introduced rats and monitor lizards; competition with the introduced bird species <i>Dicrurus macrocercus</i>; and disease (2). In addition recent typhoons have destroyed large areas of forest habitat on Rota and records indicate that brown tree snake individuals have been introduced to the island (1). If the snake establishes a population it is likely to have a catastrophic effect on the Mariana crow\xe2\x80\x99s dwindling population potentially driving it to extinction (1) (2).,The Mariana crow is listed by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service as an endangered species and several conservation measures are in place to preserve its imperilled island populations (2) (5). At present one of the main priorities for the preservation of the Mariana crow is to research and reduce the threat posed by the brown treesnake on both islands including the prevention of further spread to Rota (5). In 1993 a National Wildlife Refuge was established on Guam to preserve the remaining forest and a 40 hectare snake-free area has been created for the introduction of Mariana crows. On Rota a predation control experiment is to be initiated and there are plans to extend the coverage of the island\xe2\x80\x99s protected areas under the Habitat Conservation Plan for Rota's Agricultural Homesteads (1) (2). In addition to the implementation of measures to reduce the brown treesnake population and to protect remaining habitat it is essential that further research is carried out to assess the population status of the Mariana crow on Rota. This includes detailed research into the relative importance of different factors affecting the species\xe2\x80\x99 survival and reproduction (5). ,disease;pet; ,protected; ,2,1679,Mí€Œçsafuera Rayadito,Aphrastura masafuerae,Masafuera rayadito (Aphrastura masafuerae),Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Furnariidae,Aphrastura (1),Body length: 16 cm (2),Introduced mammals are the biggest threat to this species causing damage to its sheltered habitats and increasing predation. Goats and rabbits brought to the island the Juan Fern\xc3\xa1ndez archipelago graze and trample vegetation creating large areas that are dangerously exposed for the birds (5). Introduced rats mice and feral cats all probably prey on this species posing a threat to the eggs chicks and adults (2). The only native predator of the Masafuera rayadito on Alejandro Selkirk the red-backed (or Masafuera) hawk (<em>Buteo polyosoma</em>) has increased in numbers since hunting it became illegal and following an increase of introduced mice and rats on which it can feed (6).,Despite recognition of the Juan Fern\xc3\xa1ndez Islands as an important area for wildlife (they are now a National Park and Endemic Bird Area) (5) population numbers of the Masafuera rayadito may still be declining. Conservation measures have included removing sheep from the island in 1983 and sporadic goat control programmes from 1998 until 2003. Proposed measures prioritise the eradication of introduced mammal species including goats rats and cats (2) (3) and this must be followed by preventing the introduction of any new alien species (5). Increased monitoring and understanding of the ecology and threats to this bird will improve conservation efforts and comparisons with related species such as the thorn-tailed rayadito (<em>Aphrastura spinicauda</em>) and other <strong>endemic</strong> species of the archipelago may help (2) (3). ,hunting; , ,1,0680,Kiwikiu,Pseudonestor xanthophrys,Maui parrotbill (Pseudonestor xanthophrys),Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Drepanididae,Pseudonestor (1),Length: 14 cm (2),Already restricted to higher elevations because of mosquito-borne diseases at lower elevations the Maui parrotbill is further excluded from the highest elevations due to habitat destruction and is therefore limited to a very small range (7). Although it occupies all suitable areas it has a low population density with the total population currently numbering just 500 individuals (4). The population density is thought to be constrained by food availability which has been reduced as a result of the habitat damage caused by feral pigs. Habitat degradation elsewhere appears to exacerbate the effects of heavy rainfall which may have an effect on nest failure (7).,The Hawaiian Division of Forestry and Wildlife implemented a five year recovery plan for the Maui parrotbill in 2003 which aims to protect existing habitat continue research into the ecology of the species and the threats it faces restore potential habitat and run a captive breeding programme for release of Maui parrotbills into this newly restored habitat (7). ,disease; ,captive breeding; ,1,1681,Zosterops chloronothos,Zosterops chloronothus,Mauritius olive white-eye (Zosterops chloronothus),Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Zosteropidae,Zosterops (1),Length: 10 cm (2),Like many native species on Mauritius the Mauritius olive white-eye has been badly affected by habitat loss and by predation by introduced mammals. The species has a very small range and its habitat is continuing to decline in extent and quality compounding the major threat of nest predation. As a result the Mauritius olive white-eye population has declined drastically since the mid-1970s from around 350 pairs to only 100 or so in 2001 (2) (3) (6). In addition the extremely low reproductive success recorded in recent years is of critical concern (7). With such a small population the species is also particularly vulnerable to extinction from extreme events such as cyclones.,The Mauritius olive white-eye is protected by law and part of its range occurs within the Black River National Park. There are also plans to purchase habitat around Bassin Blanc (2). In 2005 a species recovery programme was initiated by the Mauritian Wildlife Foundation with the aim of increasing knowledge of the Mauritius olive white-eye and its threats and to investigate management techniques. Since then an intensive management plan has been applied to the species involving monitoring of the wild population undertaking predator control at nest sites rescue and harvest of wild nests artificial incubation and hand-rearing of offspring. However it is thought that effective habitat management and releases onto predator-free islets are more viable options than captive breeding (2) (6). ,loss; ,captive breeding;protected; ,1,2682,McCordí¢ŒóŒ»s box turtle,Cuora mccordi,Mccordí¢ŒóŒ»s box turtle (Cuora mccordi),Animalia,Chordata,Reptilia,Testudines,Bataguridae,Cuora (1),Maximum carapace length: 13.4 í¢ŒóŒñ 16.5 cm (2),Like many of Asia\xe2\x80\x99s turtle species Mccord\xe2\x80\x99s box turtles are dangerously close to extinction because they are being over exploited by the Asian turtle trade for meat and traditional medicine (4). In addition the turtle has suffered from capture for the western pet market and from habitat loss and degradation. The species has become increasingly scarce within the Chinese food markets indicating that populations in the wild are declining. Furthermore the extremely high prices paid in the western pet market by turtle enthusiasts with individuals reaching up to US$ 2000 signifies the rarity and difficulty of obtaining these animals (2). It has been estimated that perhaps no more than 350 specimens remain possibly considerably fewer all within private or zoo collections (6). Although no direct studies have been made it is assumed that this species\xe2\x80\x99 habitat must have been drastically affected by the large-scale deforestation experienced within southwest China. Additionally pollution is a major problem in the area\xe2\x80\x99s waterways. Indeed the China Environment Report ranks China as the highest producer of sulphur dioxide in the world with Guangxi and Guangdong belonging to the areas most affected by acid rain (2).,As a native Chinese species Mccord\xe2\x80\x99s box turtle is protected by the Wildlife Protection Law of 1988 which requires that capture transport and trade in wild animals is by official permit only. China\xe2\x80\x99s National Environmental Protection Agency (1998) has recommended that the species be listed as \xe2\x80\x98major protected wildlife\xe2\x80\x99 in order to prohibit capture and trade completely. This would help the survival of this critically endangered turtle but only if such laws could viably be enforced something that is notoriously difficult. Over 51 nature reserves and two \xe2\x80\x98scenic areas\xe2\x80\x99 have been established in Guangxi where Mccord\xe2\x80\x99s box turtle may occur but quantitative surveys of the species\xe2\x80\x99 population size and distribution are needed to better determine the benefits of these protected areas for the species (2). The current outlook for Mccord\xe2\x80\x99s box turtle in the wild is pretty grim but the species\xe2\x80\x99 prospects for continuing survival are nevertheless hopeful largely due to its ability to adapt well to captivity and successfully reproduce (6). However there have been no plans for releasing captive-bred individuals into the wild and until the current climate of the Asian turtle trade western pet market and ongoing habitat destruction change it would seem unsafe to do so. Until such time captive-bred individuals can serve to buffer against total extinction but nevertheless remain a poor substitute for a self-sustainable population in the wild where this turtle belongs. ,loss;environment;pet;pollution; ,protection law;protected; ,4,2683,Phoque-moine Mí€Œ©diterraní€Œ©en,Monachus monachus,Mediterranean monk seal (Monachus monachus),Animalia,Chordata,Mammalia,Carnivora,Phocidae,Monachus (1),Length of male: 240 cm (2)Length of female: 238 cm (2)Weight of male: 315 kg (2)Weight of female: 300 kg (2),Mediterranean monk seals are highly sensitive to disturbance and humans have extensively used both the sea and beaches of their habitat for centuries causing the population to collapse (2).

Underplanting is one of the main problems affecting the remaining forest a process in which food-producing plants such as bananas are planted within forests where they alter the natural vegetation composition and eventually cause the degradation of the forest habitat.

Annual harvests were thought to be taking between 8000 and 36000 animals before a ban on hunting was introduced and as a result of this exploitation the population on the island is thought to be near extinction (1).,Hunting of the mountain chicken was banned on Dominica in the late 1990s although a three month open season was declared at the end of 2001 and hunting was not fully prohibited until 2003 (1) (3). Public awareness programmes have also been implemented to inform the Dominican public of the threats the mountain chicken faces and to try to discourage hunting (1). \xa0 ,loss;hunting;disease; ,captive breeding; ,3,1690,Broom's pygmy-possum; burramys; mountain pygmy possum,Burramys parvus,Mountain pygmy-possum (Burramys parvus),Animalia,Chordata,Mammalia,Diprotodontia,Burramyidae,Burramys (1),30 - 60 g (2),Due to the restrictions of its habitat requirements the mountain pygmy-possum has suffered from the development of the ski industry in the Australian Alps. A further threat comes from habitat loss caused by increased temperatures and decreasing snow cover as a result of global warming while predation by the red fox (<em>Vulpes vulpes</em>) and feral cats is also a problem\xa0(1)\xa0(2)\xa0(3)\xa0(4).

Management plans for the species have been put in place in Victoria and New South Wales and a national recovery plan is currently being prepared\xa0(1). A range of conservation measures have been recommended for this small possum including protection and restoration of the remaining habitat population and habitat monitoring predator control measures to protect the possums in ski resorts further research and captive breeding programmes\xa0(1)\xa0(3)\xa0(4). ,loss; ,captive breeding;protected; ,1,2691,Mlanje cedar; Mlanje cypress; Mulanje cedarwood,Widdringtonia whytei,Mulanje cedar (Widdringtonia whytei),Plantae,Tracheophyta,Coniferopsida,Coniferales,Cupressaceae,Widdringtonia (1),Height: 42.7 m (2)Trunk diameter: 1.5 m (2),The Mulanje cedar has been heavily exploited in the past (3) (5) (9) with its wood used as timber and its sawdust distilled to obtain oil for local use as an insecticide (3) (5) (10). The wood is considered enormously valuable being very fragrant and resistant to termites borers and fungal disease. It is used locally for making carvings boxes and furniture sold to tourists and is also sold abroad for light construction and flooring. The timber is thought to be particularly good for boat-building to the point that fishery officials have urged that remaining supplies be reserved for the Lake Malawi fishing industry. The Forestry Department of Malawi have recently agreed to supply Mulanje Cedar to build 450 boats for this purpose (11). The tree\xe2\x80\x99s decline has been somewhat stemmed by a ban on felling allowing exploitation only of dead trees but illegal felling and killing of trees continues at an alarming rate. The Mulanje Mountain Forest Reserve is also generally threatened by encroachment and large-scale development such as the continual threat of bauxite mining. Additionally there is concern that mature individuals appear to be dying at a high rate thought possibly to be due to their high sensitivity to forest fires and susceptibility to attacks by a species of aphid (3). Regeneration on the other hand seems to depend on fire and is extremely poor. In addition <i>Pinus patula</i> (originally a commercial plantation species) has invaded a number of areas suitable for <i>Widdringtonia</i> colonisation (5) (9). All these threats have greatly impacted the Mulanje cedar; a 2007 study found that the remaining Mulanje cedar forests had been reduced by 40 percent over the previous 15 years (3). Out of the remaining 845.3 hectares of forest identified over 32 percent of standing Mulanje cedar was found to be dead (3). As so much dead wood is available for utilisation there should be no reason to cut live Mulanje cedar (3).,All Mulanje cedars are protected within the Mulanje Mountain Forest Reserve and licences are available now only for the exploitation of dead trees from the Forestry Department of Malawi (3) (9). The Mulanje Mountain Conservation Trust has also been set up to provide long-term support for the research and conservation of biological diversity in the Mulanje Mountain Forest Reserve and the sustainable utilisation of its natural resources. The Trust is working with the Forestry Department of Malawi in bringing in community participation to manage the resources of the forest reserve and maximise the benefits among resource users (12). Not only is the Mulanje cedar a national emblem to Malawi but it is also of critical financial importance to this relatively poor country and as such its protection and sustainable use is a national priority (6). ,fishing;disease; ,protected; ,2,1692,Munchique wood wren,Henicorhina negreti,Munchique wood-wren (Henicorhina negreti),Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Troglodytidae,Henicorhina (1),15.2 - 16.7 g (2),Due to its extremely small range and population which is known to be in decline the Munchique wood-wren is currently at high risk of extinction (3). However it has been argued that its classification of Critically Endangered (CR) on the IUCN Red List should be changed as a result of the discovery of another population in southern Antioquia (4).,There are no specific conservation measures currently known to be in place for this species but much of the Munchique wood-wren\xe2\x80\x99s range is in protected areas such as the Munchique National Park and Tambito Nature Reserve.

Its existence is also threatened by rapid afforestation with <i>Eucalyptus</i> and <i>Pinus</i> species for logging operations as well as pesticide pollution from drainage and run-off into marshes (2). Continuous over-grazing by livestock and the conversion of suitable habitat into agricultural land add to the need for protected areas to ensure the survival of this species (4).,Narosky\xe2\x80\x99s seedeater has been reported in two national parks in Argentina and a biosphere reserve in Uruguay. However law enforcement is weak and this does not guarantee the persistence of the species in these areas. Proposals to prevent the extinction of Narosky\xe2\x80\x99s seedeater include surveying south Paraguay for breeding populations monitoring known populations developing an action plan removing the incentives for afforestation of grasslands protection of breeding grounds and prohibiting the trapping and keeping of this bird in captivity (2). ,pet;pollution; , ,2,0694,Acrocephalus luscinia,Acrocephalus luscinius,Nightingale reed-warbler (Acrocephalus luscinius),Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Sylviidae,Acrocephalus (1),Length: 18 cm (2)Average male weight: 35.9 g (3)Average female weight: 32 g (3),The story of how the nightingale reed-warbler was extirpated from Guam Pagan and Tinian is one echoed by many island species across the world.

The recent precipitous decline however is almost undoubtedly linked to hunting and persecution disturbance at the breeding sites and the loss of suitable habitat such as <strong>steppe</strong> and unintensive arable land and flooding of foraging areas due to construction of dams and drainage of wetlands (5) (8). Pesticide poisoning has also had disastrous consequences most notably in Turkey in the late 1950s when hundreds were killed outright by DDT (sprayed to kill mosquitoes) with the survivors subsequently suffering very low breeding success (8) (9). In May 1996 40 of the Moroccan birds died in just nine days due to an epidemic of unknown cause demonstrating how vulnerable the small remnant populations are (8).,BirdLife International and the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds (RSPB) have been working alongside local people to research and monitor this enigmatic species. A major step has been to train and manage a team of wardens in Morocco to monitor breeding and roosting sites prevent disturbance by tourists or fishermen collect information and make local people aware of the bird\xe2\x80\x99s significance; these conservation measures have resulted in a recent slight population increase (1) (7).

Hurricane-force winds have recently scoured the Na Pali sea cliffs killing many plants (7). Additionally while most populations are found on virtually inaccessibly sea-cliffs the Waiahuakua population on Kaua\xe2\x80\x99i is more accessible and has suffered damage from the activities of feral goats (6). In the early 1990s Kaua\xe2\x80\x99i had a total of approximately 150 individuals on the Na Pali sea cliffs where today there remain only seven (7). With such critically low numbers there is a concern that genetic variability will get too low as a result of inbreeding between remaining plants for the species to adequately respond to environmental pressures (7) (3). Thus although once fairly common this species is now teetering on the brink of extinction in the wild (8).,Botanists and horticulturists concerned about the plight of Hawaii\xe2\x80\x99s threatened plant species have helped save this fantastic plant from total extinction by pollinating the remaining wild specimens by hand and collecting seeds for propagation (8). Successful germination of the seeds has enabled large numbers of plants to be grown in botanical gardens to be used in a replanting programme (8). Today there are more plants in the Limahuli Gardens and McBride Gardens on Kaua\xe2\x80\x99i than there are in the wild (5)! Endangered species may benefit from increased artificial gene flow especially if they have passed through a genetic bottleneck due to <strong>inbreeding depression</strong> and hand pollination experiments have aided in this respect (7). Investigation into possible alternative pollinators is also being planned (7). Such research will undoubtedly aid the creation of guidelines for the re-introduction of the magnificent \xe2\x80\x98olulu into protected cliff sites where it once flourished (7). ,loss;environmental;environment;invasive;pet; ,protected; ,5,1705,Loro Ventrinaranja; Periquito Ventrinaranja,Neophema chrysogaster,Orange-bellied parrot (Neophema chrysogaster),Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Psittachiformes,Psittacidae,Neophema (1),45 - 50 g (2),This previously abundant species has suffered a precipitous decline in numbers since the 1920s primarily due to habitat loss at the overwintering grounds caused by both urban development and farming practices (5) (6). Competition with introduced species for both food and nest sites together with predation by red foxes and feral cats have further depleted populations of\xa0orange-bellied parrots\xa0(6).,An Orange-Bellied Parrot Action Plan has been running since 1980 aiming to improve the conservation status of this species so that it is no longer classified as Critically Endangered (2). Populations are regularly monitored and areas of habitat particularly in the winter grounds are protected as reserves (2). The control of predators occurs in some areas and in the moorland habitat of Tasmania controlled burning is used to increase food productivity (2). A captive breeding programme has also been set up to augment wild population numbers and by 1999 72 birds had been released into the wild with some successfully completing the return migration (2). To date the success of the Action Plan has been mixed; some intensively managed populations are showing encouraging increases in numbers whilst others continue to fall (6).

Like many other reptile species around the world the principal threat to its survival is the uncontrolled collection of wild specimens for the pet trade (1). The poaching of rare species is alarmingly widespread in the mountains of the Caucasus with the illegal wildlife trade being one of the main conservation concerns in the region (10).,Owing to its precarious status in the wild Orlov's viper is in dire need of a raft of immediate conservation measures. The main priorities include the establishment of reserves where this Critically Endangered snake will be protected from poaching; the development of conservation legislation particularly concerning the regulation of trade; the implementation of education programmes for local people; and further research into the species' natural history distribution and population dynamics (1). ,poaching;pet; ,protected; ,2,1710,Painted batagur; Saw-jawed terrapin; Three-striped batagur,Batagur borneoensis,Painted terrapin (Batagur borneoensis),Animalia,Chordata,Reptilia,Testudines,Emydidae,Callagur (1),1.7 kg (2),This species is now rare throughout much of its former range with only one or two rivers home to more than 100 nesting females (2). Painted terrapins are massively exploited for their eggs which are sold for human consumption in many parts of Asia (5). Terrapin eggs are worth five times as much as chicken eggs and this species is particularly vulnerable to over-exploitation due to its low egg productivity (2). Habitat destruction is another major source of species decline; sand mining beach protection and beachfront development all disrupt the breeding habits of the terrapins (2).,International trade in painted terrapins is banned by its listing on Appendix I of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) (1) and protective legislation is also in place in most of Peninsular Malaysia (2). Egg harvesting may only be carried out by licensed collectors who then sell 70 percent of their haul to the Malaysian Fisheries Department to be incubated thus ensuring the sustainable management of this species (2). Prices offered by the Fisheries Department are however not competitive with those obtained on the black market and in the majority of cases only a very small percentage of turtle eggs are recovered (2). The enforcement of these schemes is a priority for future conservation action plans along with the protection of areas where significant populations are known to exist. A decline in the demand for terrapin eggs is the key to saving this species from extinction but would require a cultural change amongst local communities. , ,cites; ,0,1711,Rodrigues bottle palm; spindle palm,Hyophorbe verschaffeltii,Palmiste marron (Hyophorbe verschaffeltii),Plantae,Tracheophyta,Liliopsida,Arecales,Palmae,Hyophorbe (1),Height: up to 12 m (2)Trunk height: 6 - 9 m (2)Trunk diameter: 25 - 45 cm (2),Although widely cultivated as an ornamental palm (1) (5) (7) the palmiste marron is the second rarest palm on Rodrigues with fewer than 60 individuals left in the wild and little if any natural regeneration occurring on the island (1) (7) (8).

These threats currently come in the form of ever-increasing tourist pressure the construction of roads and the use of all-terrrain vehicles (1) (3).  The collection of specimens may also be contributing to the decline in lizard numbers which has been observed over the last three decades.  In addition it is thought that the Pe\xc3\xb1a de Francia rock lizard may be very sensitive to any changes to the climate in its habitat and thus could be affected in the future by global climate change (1) (3).,The entire range of the Pe\xc3\xb1a de Francia rock lizard lies within the \xe2\x80\x98Parque Natural de las Batuecas y Sierra de Francia\xe2\x80\x99 a protected natural area (3) but this clearly does not protect it from all threats such as increasing tourism and thus a specific management plan for the recovery of this species is required (1).

All the <strong>subspecies</strong> of Pennant\xe2\x80\x99s red colobus are close to extinction with very restricted ranges and small numbers as a result of extensive habitat loss and intensive hunting (7).,Pennant\xe2\x80\x99s red colobus is listed on Appendix II of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) meaning that international trade in this species should be carefully controlled (4). It is also listed on Class B of the African Convention on the Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources which means that Pennant\xe2\x80\x99s red colobus may only be captured or killed with special authorisation (9). ,loss;hunting; ,cites;protected; ,2,2715,Propithecus diadema perrieri,Propithecus perrieri,Perrierí¢ŒóŒ»s sifaka (Propithecus perrieri),Animalia,Chordata,Mammalia,Primates,Indriidae,Propithecus (1),3.7 í¢ŒóŒñ 5 kg (2),Like many of Madagascar\xe2\x80\x99s primates Perrier\xe2\x80\x99s sifaka is threatened by hunting and habitat loss. Suitable forest habitat is diminishing as a result of land clearance for agriculture and livestock timber harvesting for charcoal and construction and small-scale mining for gemstones (4) and even within a so-called protected area where this species occurs an annual deforestation rate of 1.2 percent has been recorded (6). Whilst taboos against hunting once existed in many parts of Madagascar the increase in immigrants without belief in such taboos has led to a worrying growth in hunting (2). Such threats have already reduced this species\xe2\x80\x99 population to perilously low levels - in 2003-2004 it was estimated there were only 915 individuals remaining \xe2\x80\x93 and continue to push Perrier\xe2\x80\x99s sifaka towards extinction (6). Such a small population is at great risk of problems arising from loss of <strong>genetic variation</strong> making the long term viability of this species highly questionable (2) (6).,Analamerana Special Reserve harbours the majority of the Perrier\xe2\x80\x99s sifaka population (1) although rather than offering the protection this rare species requires forest within the reserve is still being gradually destroyed (1) (6) and this species clearly requires further protection if it is going to survive. Since 2005 a group of interested parties led by the Monaco-based non-governmental organisation Act for Nature and the Groupe d\xe2\x80\x99Etude et de Recherche sur les Primates de Madagascar have been conducting a conservation and research programme for Perrier\xe2\x80\x99s sifaka. The programme\xe2\x80\x99s goals are to secure this species\xe2\x80\x99 future in at least one major area currently without any degree of protection and to gain further scientific knowledge on this species that will help inform future conservation measures (7). The area between Analamerana Special Reserve and Ankarana Special Reserve is one area where forest protection has been strongly recommended (4). ,loss;hunting; , ,2,0716,red-vented cockatoo,Cacatua haematuropygia,Philippine cockatoo (Cacatua haematuropygia),Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Psittaciformes,Psittacidae,Cacatua (1),300 g (2),Once widespread and fairly common the Philippine cockatoo has recently undergone a dramatic decline and is now one of the most threatened birds of the Philippines (7).  A combination of trapping for the <strong>aviculture</strong> trade and widespread deforestation has pushed the Philippine cockatoo towards the edge of extinction and it is now absent from 98 percent of its former range (2) (7).  A 1994 study showed this bird to be present on just eight of the Philippine islands (6).  Its remote forest habitat and agile flight are no deterrents for trappers who know the exact location of many of its nest holes and roosting sites and frequently raid them (7) (8).  In addition the Philippine cockatoo is persecuted for the damage it inflicts on crops (6) and an outbreak of Psittacine beak and feather disease may also be impacting the population (7).,The critically endangered Philippine cockatoo is listed on Appendix I of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) meaning that trade in this species is only permitted in exceptional circumstances (3) and it is also occurs in a number of protected areas (6).  In addition the Philippine Cockatoo Conservation Program implemented in 1998 is carrying out a number of measures to ensure the cockatoo\xe2\x80\x99s survival.  This includes researching the cockatoo\xe2\x80\x99s behaviour breeding habits and potentially threatening diseases; encouraging poachers and hunters to end their unsustainable activities and become wardens island rangers and guides instead; and a captive breeding program that serves as a safe-guard against this species\xe2\x80\x99 extinction (8).  With such valuable efforts taking place hopefully the current perilous situation will soon improve for the handsome Philippine cockatoo. ,disease; ,cites;captive breeding;protected; ,1,3717,great Philippine eagle; monkey-eating eagle,Pithecophaga jefferyi,Philippine eagle (Pithecophaga jefferyi),Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Falconiformes,Accipitridae,Pithecophaga (1),6.5 kg (2),Although probably never abundant the population of the Philippine eagle has undergone a precipitous decline primarily as the result of habitat destruction (5). Vast tracts of tropical forests in the Philippines have been cleared for commercial development and for shifting cultivation (5). Mining activities and hunting pose further threats to the survival of this majestic bird and the accumulation of pesticides may be responsible for a reduction in reproductive rate (5).,The Philippine eagle is protected by law in the Philippines and occurs in a number of protected areas (5); international trade and movement of this species is also restricted and controlled by CITES (the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species) (1) (3). The Philippine Eagle Conservation Programme (2) is working on educational campaigns protecting and monitoring nests and a conservation breeding scheme (7); so far two captive-bred chicks have been produced with the aim of reintroducing them to the wild (6). In addition chicks and eggs have been taken from areas of habitat at risk in order to establish a viable captive population from which individuals can be reintroduced to the wild (2). Despite these efforts however should habitat loss and subsequent human settlement continue at the current rate it seems doubtful that this majestic species will ever recover. ,hunting; ,cites;protected; ,1,2718,Geomyda leytensis; Heosemys leytensis,Siebenrockiella leytensis,Philippine pond turtle (Siebenrockiella leytensis),Animalia,Chordata,Reptilia,Testudines,Geomydidae,Siebenrockiella (1),Average length: 21 cm (2),With just three specimens collected from Leyte in 1921 and one from Palawan in 1988 (1) with reports of some in 2004 (2) the Philippine pond turtle\xe2\x80\x99s extreme rarity is undoubtedly cause for concern.  Such rarity has gained the Philippine pond turtle somewhat of a legendary reputation one that makes any further discovered individuals highly vulnerable to the pet trade where they would be a highly desired and valuable object (1).,Further research into the Philippine pond turtle is clearly needed (4) as more information would allow appropriate conservation actions to be implemented before time runs out for this mysterious reptile. ,pet; , ,1,0719,Angonoka; Madagascar angulated tortoise; Madagascar tortoise,Astrochelys yniphora,Ploughshare tortoise (Astrochelys yniphora),Animalia,Chordata,Reptilia,Testudines,Testudinidae,Astrochelys (1),Shell length: up to 43 cm (2).,The main threats affecting this very rare species include habitat loss largely as a result of uncontrolled bush fires predation of eggs and young by the introduced bush pig (<i>Potamochoerus larvatus</i>) and illegal collecting by people (5) (8). Like other tortoises and turtles this species has a slow growth rate and low breeding potential. In addition it takes individuals a long time to reach sexual maturity. All of these factors reduce the capacity of populations to recover from human-induced effects on the population (5) (7).,A recovery programme was established for this species in 1986 by the Jersey Wildlife Preservation Trust in collaboration with the Malagasy Department of Waters and Forests.  A captive-breeding facility was established in Madagascar and within eight years over 100 young ploughshare tortoises had been bred. A study into the habitat of the species and interactions with humans was also established and a grassroots-level environmental education programme was set up (10). Experimental reintroductions of captive-bred tortoises have been successful to date and large-scale release to re-establish extirpated populations are being planned (5). Although international trade in the ploughshare tortoise is illegal due to its listing under Appendix I of the Convention of International trade in Endangered Species (CITES) poor enforcement of the exotic pet trade is causing great problems. In 1996 73 individuals were stolen from the captive breeding programme in Madagascar and as recently as 2003 reptile collectors have been arrested with wild ploughshare tortoises in their possession destined for the international exotic pet market (5). When a species is this rare outrageous crimes such as these have serious implications for the already precarious state of the species (11).

Overall this species has undergone a population decline of over 80 percent in the past decade (1) (6) (7) mainly due to the loss and degradation of its habitat (1) (5) (6) (7).,The Portuguese Red Book lists the Portuguese arched-mouth nase as Critically Endangered (6). This species is covered by national and international conservation legislation (6) including the Bern Convention (12) and EU Habitats Directive (13).

Many of these threats interlink making the problems harder to resolve.\xa0,The puaiohi is protected by federal and state law and its range is part of a reserve the Alaka`I Wilderness Preserve established in 1964 (3) (7). A successful captive breeding programme is in place for the species and numerous captive-bred individuals have been released back into the wild (2). As a consequence the breeding population numbers are rising so the species may be moved from Critically Endangered to the less threatened status of Endangered in the future (2). ,invasive;disease;pet; ,captive breeding;protected; ,3,2722,í¢ŒóŒÖolulu; alula; haha; pu aupaka,Brighamia rockii,Puaí¢ŒóŒ»ala (Brighamia rockii),Plantae,Tracheophyta,Magnoliopsida,Campanulales,Campanulaceae,Brighamia (1),Height: 1 í¢ŒóŒñ 5 m (1),Once fairly common the pua\xe2\x80\x99ala is now at risk of extinction due to habitat degradation predation by feral goats and competition from introduced plant and animal species (4). Low reproductive rates which exacerbate the problem by making recovery slow could be due to low pollen production low establishment of seedlings and the decline of natural pollinators (5). An additional fear is low genetic variability as a result of inbreeding between the few remaining plants will mean failure to produce healthy seedlings able of responding to environmental change (4).,The Conservation Department of the National Tropical Botanical Garden (NTBG) in Hawaii has taken a lead in the conservation of this rare and unusual species by conducting manual pollination and seed collection. As a result cultivated conservation collections have been established which will ensure against total extinction. Recovery plans are being created that will investigate possible alternative pollinators and create guidelines for the reintroduction of the pua\xe2\x80\x99ala (4). It has been suggested that a successful recovery plan needs to examine the whole of the reproductive strategy and also map the genetic diversity in the surviving populations. Research into possible pests and diseases and testing the influence of weeding and fencing has also been advocated (5). ,environmental;environment;pet; , ,3,0723,Puerto Rican parrot; red-fronted Amazon,Amazona vittata,Puerto Rican Amazon (Amazona vittata),Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Psittaciformes,Psittacidae,Amazona (1),250 í¢ŒóŒñ 300 g (2),So far the Puerto Rican Amazon has only narrowly escaped extinction reaching an all-time low of just 13 birds in 1975 (7). The initial and primary cause of decline was the widespread forest clearance that accompanied European settlement during the 18th and 19th Centuries (2). The bird has also suffered badly from persecution as a crop pest and hunting for food and the pet trade so that by the 1930s this previously abundant species had dramatically reduced to around 2000 individuals confined to a small range in the Luquillo Mountains (3) (6). The species then endured an ongoing decline until 1975 after which intensive conservation efforts helped it to gradually recover although efforts were hindered by the impact of Hurricane Hugo in September 1989 which reduced the population of 47 birds to 22 (2) (3). Despite recent population increases the parrot is considered Critically Endangered because its numbers still remain dangerously small (7). Currently the principle threats are competition for nest-sites loss of young to parasitic botflies (<i>Philornis pici</i>) predation by the pearly-eyed thrasher (<i>Margarops</i> <i>fuscatus</i>) and the red-tailed hawk (<i>Buteo</i> <i>jamaicensis</i>) and natural disasters such as hurricanes (7) (8). The extremely small size of the remaining population deems all threats incredibly serious (8).,In 1968 concentrated conservation efforts were begun to try to mitigate all these threats involving experiments with artificial nest-sites control of nest predators and competitors and captive breeding and <strong>re-introduction</strong> (7). The Puerto Rican Parrot Recovery\xc2\xa0Programme was begun\xc2\xa0between the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) the U.S.D.A. Forest Service and the Puerto Rico Department of Natural and Environmental Resources (DNER) (9). Captive breeding was initiated in 1973 with the creation of the Luquillo Aviary within the Caribbean National Forest (4). In 1993 this captive flock was split and a portion moved to a second aviary in Rio Abajo at the opposite end of the island in order to prevent the potential catastrophic loss of the entire captive flock due to hurricanes or disease (4) (5) (8). The captive breeding programme has experienced great success with 190 birds now living in the two breeding aviaries (4). Since May 2000 captive reared parrots have been being released into the wild to bolster the wild population with over 40 birds released to date (4). All remaining habitat is protected in the Caribbean National Forest (7) but it is nevertheless possible that a single powerful hurricane could destroy the entire wild population in their restricted range of a single mountainous valley (4). Thus exciting plans have been made by Dr. White for a huge release in 2006 into a second more protected Karst region on the opposite end of the island (4). Should this introduction be successful this rare parrot will be given an infinitely greater chance of survival and although still critically low the species\xe2\x80\x99 steadily increasing numbers provide a glimpse of hope for the future. ,loss;hunting;pet; ,captive breeding;protected; ,3,2724,black sage; cliff manjack,Cordia rupicola,Puerto Rico manjack (Cordia rupicola),Plantae,Tracheophyta,Magnoliopsida,Lamiales,Boraginaceae,Cordia (1),Height: up to 5 m (2) (3),The main threat to the Puerto Rico manjack is habitat loss and fragmentation due to residential and tourist developments on Anegada (1) (3) (9). This habitat loss is only likely to accelerate over the next few years and is compounded by other threats from road construction invasive plant species fire and trampling and grazing by introduced cattle goats and donkeys (1) (3) (9).

The most significant threat to the purple-winged ground-dove is habitat loss (2) (3). Its range falls within the most important agricultural land in Brazil (3) and its habitat has therefore been subject to large-scale clearance for agricultural plantations leaving the remainder highly fragmented (2). This has led to concern that the increased distances between local bamboo flowering events and the likelihood of long periods without bamboo seed production anywhere within its range will rapidly drive the purple-winged ground-dove to extinction (2).,Although the purple-winged ground-dove has been recorded in several protected areas in Brazil and in Iguaz\xc3\xba National Park in Argentina only small numbers have been observed and the enforcement of habitat protection in these areas is often inadequate. The current priority for this species is therefore to conduct surveys to locate additional populations and to learn more about its biology so that effective conservation strategies can be employed (2). ,loss; ,captive breeding;protected; ,1,2726,Sus salvanius,Porcula salvania,Pygmy hog (Porcula salvania),Animalia,Chordata,Mammalia,Cetartiodactyla,Suidae,Porcula (1),Male head-body length: 61 - 71 cm (2)Female head-body length: 55 - 62 cm (2)Male weight: 8 - 10 kg (2)Female weight: 6 - 8 kg (2),The tall grassland habitat of the pygmy hog has been extensively destroyed by development agriculture domestic grazing and deliberate fires (2).

Although droughts and population fluctuations have been a natural occurrence throughout Raso Island\xe2\x80\x99s recorded history there is concern that the effects of climate change may lead to more extreme periods of drought leading to this species\xe2\x80\x99 extinction (2) (3).,Not only is the Raso lark a protected species under Cape Verde law but Raso Island is classified as a National Park and requires official authorisation to visit (2) (3). Unfortunately despite these regulations poor enforcement means that unofficial visits to the island by fishermen and tourists are common (3).

These reductions were believed to be due to various factors including the fall in populations of large <strong>ungulates</strong> as a result of uncontrolled hunting disease direct persecution of the birds and developments in waste disposal meaning that carcasses were more likely to be quickly disposed of in areas of human habitation (4) (6).,Although the red-headed vulture occurs in various protected areas throughout its range these are unable protect it from diclofenac treated livestock. Fortunately the manufacture of diclofenac has now been banned in India Nepal and Pakistan and its use is being phased out and replaced with a similar drug that is not toxic to vultures. However it may be some years before the use of diclofenac completely comes to an end in these countries.

In the 1800s the rate of deforestation accelerated dramatically first with the production of coffee and later with cocoa. At one stage in the early 20th century S\xc3\xa3o Tom\xc3\xa9 was the world\xe2\x80\x99s largest producer of cocoa with an estimated 42 percent of the island being devoted to its production. The crash in the price of cocoa and the island\xe2\x80\x99s conversion to independence in 1975 put a stop to forest clearance but not before almost all the island\xe2\x80\x99s lowland <strong>primary forest</strong> had been destroyed (5). The impact of this large scale loss of habitat for the S\xc3\xa3o Tom\xc3\xa9 fiscal is plain to see with its population estimated in 2000 to be less than 50 individuals (2). While much of the cultivated land has now reverted back to <strong>secondary forest</strong> the S\xc3\xa3o Tom\xc3\xa9 fiscal appears to be restricted to the tiny remaining areas of lowland <strong>primary forest</strong>. Fortunately because these areas are so remote they are not under immediate threat but with road development opening up more and more land on the island this could very easily change in the future. Furthermore there is high probability that introduced animals such as rats monkeys weasels and civets have had a negative impact on nesting birds including the S\xc3\xa3o Tom\xc3\xa9 fiscal (2) (5).,With patches of <strong>primary forest</strong> protected within Obo Natural Park on S\xc3\xa3o Tom\xc3\xa9 it is hoped that habitat suitable for the S\xc3\xa3o Tom\xc3\xa9 fiscal will be preserved for the future. However the benefit this species derives from this protected area is unclear as its specific ecological requirements are still so poorly understood (2) (7). It is therefore paramount that further research is carried out to develop a greater understanding of this species\xe2\x80\x99 ecology as well as its population size and dynamics. This information will be invaluable in determining which areas should be prioritised for protection. Unfortunately as with many developing countries human and financial resources for conservation are limited and consequently at this stage law enforcement is non-existent. Nonetheless proposals have been made to actively manage and protect these areas as well as to list the S\xc3\xa3o Tom\xc3\xa9 fiscal as a protected species under national law. This is something that will become more and more crucial as development begins to encroach on the remnant patches of <strong>primary forest</strong> favoured by the S\xc3\xa3o Tom\xc3\xa9 fiscal and many other <strong>endemic</strong> species (2). ,loss; ,protected; ,1,1751,Sao Tome canary; Sao Tome goldfinch,Neospiza concolor,Sao Tome grosbeak (Neospiza concolor),Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Fringillidae,Neospiza (1),Length: 18 cm (2),Forest clearance began on S\xc3\xa3o Tom\xc3\xa9 in the late 15th century when early colonisers made space for the cultivation of sugar cane. In the 1800s the rate of deforestation accelerated dramatically first with the production of coffee and later with cocoa. At one stage in the early 20th century S\xc3\xa3o Tom\xc3\xa9 was the world\xe2\x80\x99s largest producer of cocoa with an estimated 42 percent of the island being devoted to its production. The crash in the price of cocoa and the island\xe2\x80\x99s conversion to independence in 1975 put a stop to forest clearance but not before almost all the island\xe2\x80\x99s lowland primary forest had been destroyed (3). Naturally this had a devastating impact on much of the <strong>endemic</strong> wildlife including the S\xc3\xa3o Tom\xc3\xa9 grosbeak population (2) (3). Today the population is estimated at less than 50 individuals restricted to habitat under increasing pressure from land privatisation (2) (4). Furthermore road developments along the east and west coasts are increasing access to previously remote areas while introduced rats monkeys weasels and civets are all potential predators (2) (3).,Primary forest is protected as a Zona Ecologica and within Obo Natural Park but there is no law enforcement within these areas and owing to the lack of information on the S\xc3\xa3o Tom\xc3\xa9 grosbeak\xe2\x80\x99s ecological requirements it is not known how much it benefits from its occurrence within these areas. Fortunately this species mainly occurs in a relatively remote part of the island visited only by hunters who do not pose a threat to it. \xa0Recently the Associa\xc3\xa7\xc3\xa3o dos Bi\xc3\xb3logos Santomenses has been offering training course to the local community in order to raise awareness and involve people in the monitoring and conservation of S\xc3\xa3o Tom\xc3\xa9\xe2\x80\x99s <strong>endemic</strong> birds. Further research into this Critically Endangered species\xe2\x80\x99 population size distribution and ecological requirements is now needed to refine conservation measures.

The species has a small range where it is increasingly threatened by habitat loss and especially hunting and snaring (1). Hunters intensively pursue animals valued in traditional East Asian \xe2\x80\x98medicine\xe2\x80\x99 and the local bushmeat trades and although the saola itself apparently has limited value and is not pursued aggressively it is killed incidentally in the pursuit of other species. In the past hunters have also tried to capture the saola because of the intense interest in this new and strange species (3). Sadly the more than a dozen saola known to have been captured and held in captivity were all poorly kept and with the exception of two that were quickly released into the wild all died within days or weeks or at most five months of their capture (2) (7). None are in captivity anywhere in the world today. As of November 2010 the most recent confirmed record of the species was an adult male captured by villagers in northern Laos in August 2010 and held by them for several days before it too died (9).\xa0,The saola is found in a number of protected areas in which conservation initiatives have been implemented. In Vietnam in the Vu Quang Nature Reserve where the saola was first discovered the Ministry of Forestry has cancelled its logging operations (8) and surveys and other conservation activities have also been conducted in the Pu Huong Nature Reserve in cooperation with Vietnam's Vinh University (7). Furthermore within the Pu Mat National Park many surveys on the distribution and ecology of the saola were carried out between 1998 and 2003 as part of the Social Forestry and Nature Conservation project (7). The Ministry of Forestry in Vietnam has also issued a ban on further capture trade or holding of this rare animal given its apparent inability to survive captivity (2).\xa0 ,loss;hunting; ,protected;wwf; ,2,2753,Colibrí€Œ_ Ventrizafiro,Lepidopyga lilliae,Sapphire-bellied hummingbird (Lepidopyga lilliae),Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Apodiformes,Trochilidae,Lepitopyga (1),4 g (2),"The sapphire-bellied hummingbird population has undergone a considerable and continuing decline from the mid-1970s.

The conversion of rainforest habitat to agricultural use along with aggressive hunting for crocodile skins have contributed to the decline of this species of crocodile (5). In Cambodia which is the species' last remaining stronghold incursion into pristine habitat is now occurring through aid development programs and the hunting of adult females for crocodile farm stock is reported to be widespread (2).,Until recently very little data existed on Siamese crocodile numbers and distribution a factor which led to the species being reported as virtually extinct in the wild in 1992 (5). Since then a large amount of research has been conducted and this has shown a slightly more encouraging picture although the status is still hard to judge. Siamese crocodiles appear to be mainly found in Cambodia where updated estimates suggest a population of no greater than 5000 individuals (2) though it may be considerably less (5). However the species is extensively maintained and bred in captivity in both Thailand and Cambodia where it is farmed for the commercial value of its skins (2). The species is considered relatively inoffensive to humans making restocking programmes a distinct possibility provided sufficient habitat is maintained and protected. Local people have been reported to protect crocodiles which they view to be sacred (2). Programs are already underway in Thailand (2) and although the future of the Siamese crocodile remains in the balance there is more optimism than a decade ago. ,hunting; ,protected; ,1,1757,Siberian white crane; snow crane,Leucogeranus leucogeranus,Siberian crane (Leucogeranus leucogeranus),Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Gruiformes,Gruidae,Leucogeranus (1),4.9 - 8.6 kg (2),Main threats include habitat loss and degradation in the wintering grounds migratory stopover sites and breeding grounds. The construction of the Three Gorges Dam and the resulting hydrological changes to the lower Yangtze River is likely to have a major impact on the wintering population (6). Human pressures throughout the range are increasing and drainage agricultural development oil extraction and development are identified risks (7). Hunting in Pakistan and Afghanistan is a concern (6) and the recent war in Afghanistan is also thought to have affected migrating cranes (8). At present the populations are so small that they are vulnerable to chance events such as an outbreak of disease or extreme weather conditions genetic problems may arise as a result of increased <strong>inbreeding</strong> and the structure of the population in terms of sex-ratio and age may become skewed leading to further problems (7).,The Siberian crane is legally protected in all the countries in which it occurs and is protected from international trade by its listing on Appendix I of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) (6). Conservation of this species began in the 1970s and a number of protected areas have been established at key sites and migratory stopovers in Russia China Pakistan and India. Educational programmes have been carried out in India Pakistan and Afghanistan. Three captive-breeding facilities have been set up and a number of releases have been made (7) particularly to augment the central population (6).

Habitat destruction and hunting are the primary threats that have brought the silky sifaka to this perilous position and continue to threaten the future survival of this species. Habitat destruction such as <strong>slash-and-burn</strong> agriculture logging and mining takes place even within so-called protected areas and (7) unfortunately with such activities often comes improved infrastructure such as roads augmenting hunting opportunities (1). Sadly unlike several sifakas no taboos against hunting this species exist and many people in Madagascar view wild lemur meat as a delicacy (7).\xa0\xa0 \xa0,The silky sifaka is present in a few protected areas: the Anjanaharibe-Sud Special Reserve Marojejy National Park and more rarely the Anjanaharibe and Manandriana portions of the Makira Protected Area\xa0 (1) (7). Marojejy National Park forms part of the World Heritage Site \xe2\x80\x98The Rainforests of the Atsinanana\xe2\x80\x99 for which the silky sifaka is a flagship species (7) (8). It has been recommended that other areas of forest where the silky sifaka has been recorded should be protected (1). However as mentioned above the designation of protected areas does not always provide this Critically Endangered sifaka with the absolute protection it requires. A lack of awareness and understanding amongst local people of this sifaka\xe2\x80\x99s rarity and uniqueness is one obstacle in conservation efforts and as a result a conservation education programme took place in 2004 with encouraging results; many local people were interested in learning more about this species and showed concern for its plight (4). ,hunting; ,protected; ,1,1759,Courlis í€Œæ bec grí€ŒÂle,Numenius tenuirostris,Slender-billed curlew (Numenius tenuirostris),Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Charadriiformes,Scolopacidae,Numenius (1),Length: 36 - 41 cm (2),The decline in the population of slender-billed curlews may have been due to the extensive hunting of waders for food in the latter half of the 19<sup>th</sup>and early 20th Century. Curlews were a prime target due to their large size and slender-billed curlews may be tamer than other species making them easy targets (8). The threat of hunting remains and the continued loss and degradation of wetlands in the Mediterranean and North Africa as well as in the breeding and staging areas is also a serious threat (7). Population estimates made in 2000 put the number of slender-billed curlew at fewer than 50 individuals (7).,The slender-billed curlew is protected in the majority of range states through which it passes and is listed on Appendix I of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) (7). It is also listed on Appendix I of the Convention on Migratory Species (CMS) under which a Slender-billed Curlew Working Group (SbCWG) has been established in the framework of a \xe2\x80\x98CMS Memorandum of Understanding\xe2\x80\x99 for the species (5) (9).

By 2000 dead and dying <i>Gyps</i> vultures were being found so frequently in Nepal and India it was thought that they were suffering from an epidemic. The unnaturally high death toll was thought to be caused by a fatal virus but testing has revealed that the vultures were suffering from kidney failure following the consumption of cattle that had previously been treated with the anti-inflammatory drug diclofenac (2). In fact the decline is a result of a lethal level of the drug in a small proportion of the <strong>ungulate</strong> carcasses available to vultures but as vultures travel long distances to reach <strong>carrion</strong> a considerable proportion of the population has been affected (7).,It is necessary to prevent exposure of vultures to livestock carcasses that have been contaminated with diclofenac and to find an alternative replacement drug (7). Government commitment to the control of the use of the drug is crucial but until it has been entirely removed from the environment a collaboration of bird protection organisations plan to take all slender-billed vultures into captivity for the next 20 to 30 years to avoid further deaths which would further reduce the chance of a successful recovery of this already rare species (8). ,loss; , ,1,0761,combshark; common sawfish; Florida sawfish,Pristis pectinata,Smalltooth sawfish (Pristis pectinata),Animalia,Chordata,Chondrichthyes,Rajiformes,Pristidae,Pristis (1),350 kg (2),The smalltooth sawfish has been over-fished both intentionally and as <strong>by-catch</strong>. Accidentally caught sawfish are rarely returned to the water alive as they are difficult to disentangle from nets and are dangerous to fishermen. Sawfish are purposefully caught for sport for food and for their oil which is used to make soap medicine and for polishing leather as well as for their saws which are removed and sold as curios. Habitat modification is also contributing to the decline of this species which is slow to recover from population crashes due to slow maturation and a long reproductive cycle (1) (2) (3).,Florida has established three wildlife refuges to protect the habitat of the smalltooth sawfish and in the hope that numbers might increase sufficiently for re-colonisation of other areas (3). It has been protected from harvesting in Florida since 1992 and over the rest of American waters since 2003 (5). Research into smalltooth sawfish life-history and population distribution as well as education and awareness initiatives may help to prevent further decline of this species but these efforts must be made worldwide to ensure the protection of this amazing fish (6). , ,protected; ,0,1762,Sociable plover,Vanellus gregarius,Sociable lapwing (Vanellus gregarius),Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Charadriiformes,Charadriidae,Vanellus (1),Length: 27 í¢ŒóŒñ 30 cm (2),The cause of the recent decline in sociable lapwing numbers is unknown but it has been suggested that their habitat may have been changed after a reduction in grazing by large herds of native <strong>ungulates</strong> and domestic cattle. This species increasingly breeds near villages where conversion of the land to farmland is imminent and where additional threats such as predation by domestic animals are more likely. A further concern is the substantial increase in numbers of a predator of the sociable lapwing the rook <i>Corvus frugilegus</i>. Finally both the breeding and wintering grounds of this species have become drier which may be disrupting prey organism availability (2).,The sociable lapwing is legally protected in Armenia Kazakhstan Russia Turkmenistan Ukraine and Uzbekistan. Plans to survey the bird\xe2\x80\x99s movements in Kazakhstan should help to identify key threats.

During the 1960s the annual catch was around 80000 tonnes worldwide (5). The flesh of this species has a particularly high fat content and is prized in Japan especially for 'sashimi' markets (5) where an individual fish can fetch as much as US$ 10000 (4). Fishing mainly takes the form of <strong>purse seine netting</strong> in Australia (6) and longline fishing in the other range states; namely New Zealand Japan the Republic of Korea Taiwan and Indonesia (5).,In 1994 Australia Japan and New Zealand signed the Convention for the Conservation of Southern Bluefin Tuna in an attempt to curb the overfishing of this species (5). The Commission for the Conservation of the Southern Bluefin Tuna (CCSBT) has subsequently formed and in 2001 was joined by the Republic of Korea (5). The objective of the Commission is to ensure the conservation and optimum utilisation of the global southern bluefin tuna fishery through management measures including reduced fishing quotas and research (5). Some scientists and conservationists are worried however that the Commission does not go far enough and that global breeding stocks having been reduced by as much as 97% will require more drastic measures if they are ever to recover (6). ,fishing; , ,1,0764,Iberian nase; mira pardelha,Iberochondrostoma almacai,Southwestern arched-mouth nase (Iberochondrostoma almacai),Animalia,Chordata,Actinopterygii,Cypriniformes,Cyprinidae,Iberochondrostoma (1),Length: up to 14.8 cm (2) (3),The most significant threat to the southwestern arched-mouth nase is habitat loss due to drought which is exacerbated by climate change and water extraction for human use (1) (2) (4) (8). The pools that this species survives in during the summer have a tiny total area meaning that longer more severe droughts would put the southwestern arched-mouth nase at greater risk of extinction (1) (8).,The southwestern arched-mouth nase is listed as Critically Endangered in the Portuguese Red Book and is covered by national and international legislation (5).

More recently trapping for the illegal bird trade has driven this parrot to extinction in the wild (4) (5).,Until 2001 the Spix\xe2\x80\x99s macaw recovery programme was coordinated and implemented through the Permanent Committee for the Recovery of the Spix\xe2\x80\x99s Macaw (CPRAA) composed of the Brazilian government scientific advisors and Spix\xe2\x80\x99s macaw holders (4). While the solitary male remained in the wild he was the subject of a number of study programmes and valuable information on the natural ecology and behaviour of this species was obtained (4). The wild male had mated with a blue-winged macaw (<em>Primoliismaracana</em>) and the pair successfully fostered blue-winged macaw nestlings which were introduced to them (4). This is an encouraging finding as wild blue-winged macaws could in theory be used to foster captive-bred Spix\xe2\x80\x99s macaws in the same way (4). The future of Spix\xe2\x80\x99s macaw depends on the success of the captive-bred population and its possible reintroduction into the wild. There have been recent problems however leading the Brazilian government to suspend CPRAA in 2001 due to internal conflicts (7). While the loss of Spix\xe2\x80\x99s macaw in the wild was a devastating blow to the conservation programme if the different parties can cooperate there is hope that a wild population of Spix\xe2\x80\x99s macaws can be successfully reintroduced. , , ,0,0767,spoonbill sandpiper,Eurynorhynchus pygmeus,Spoon-billed sandpiper (Eurynorhynchus pygmeus),Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Charadriiformes,Scolopacidae,Eurynorhynchus (1),Length: 14 í¢ŒóŒñ 16 cm (2),With very particular habitat requirements high nest site fidelity and a small population habitat loss has had a large impact on this species. As with many coastal regions tidal mudflats are being reclaimed for industry or aquaculture. Pollution climate change and human disturbance have also altered the habitat of this species and hunting of shorebirds contributes to the decline of the spoon-billed sandpiper. Recent population surveys indicate an extremely rapid decline in this species with reduced productivity leading to fears that the population is ageing rapidly (2).,The spoon-billed sandpiper is protected in several areas throughout its range but would benefit from enforced legal protection wherever it is present. Shorebird hunting is prolific and affects many species; a ban would have wide-ranging benefits. A Species Action Plan was produced for the spoon-billed sandpiper in 2008 but urgent conservation action is now required to prevent its extinction (2). ,loss;hunting;pollution; ,protected; ,3,1768,Saint Helena plover; wirebird,Charadrius sanctaehelenae,St Helena plover (Charadrius sanctaehelenae),Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Charadriiformes,Charadriidae,Charadrius (1),Length: 15 cm (2),As a result of land management changes and introduced predators the population of the St Helena plover is critically low. A census carried out during 2005 and 2006 showed that this species had undergone a decline of more that 40 percent in just five years to a mere 235 individuals (3). There has since been a small increase in numbers however (6). The major factor suspected of causing the decline is a reduction in livestock grazing which has become unprofitable (2) and has led to longer grass swards and encroachment by shrubland (3). This is detrimental to breeding success as the birds rely on short swards in which to construct nests and forage. In addition to this threat growing populations of introduced predators are consuming large numbers of this species\xe2\x80\x99 eggs and chicks. To compound these existing problems there are now plans to build an airport on St Helena potentially reducing available habitat and causing further disturbance and degradation due to tourist activity. With its population currently at the lowest level ever recorded the St Helena plover is perilously close to extinction and will require careful management to ensure its survival (3).,Protected by law on St Helena since 1894 in recent years the plight of the St Helena plover has galvanised a significant amount of attention from researchers and conservationists (2) (3). Even the plan to construct the airport on St Helena has had some positive impact as it has reinforced efforts to find out more about this threatened bird\xe2\x80\x99s status and how it can be preserved (3).

This is produced from the sturgeon\xe2\x80\x99s unfertilised eggs and is almost always extracted by killing the female. The caviar industry is currently in crisis as the dwindling stocks of the stellate sturgeon and the other major caviar producing species can no longer provide sufficient caviar to meet the huge worldwide demand (2). Despite attempts to manage stellate sturgeon stocks illegal fishing and black market trade in caviar are threatening to drive this already endangered species to extinction (2) (7).,In 1998 the stellate sturgeon was listed by the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) meaning that all international trade in this species is controlled by maximum export quotas and trade permits (2) (3). The countries which are party to the CITES agreement must agree on sustainable catch and export quotas based on scientific surveys and must adopt regional conservation strategies and attempt to combat illegal fishing. The strict enforcement of these regulations meant that in 2006 caviar export was banned for all of the countries bordering the Caspian Sea since the countries failed to provide sufficient information about the sustainability of their catch. This promoted an agreement between the countries to reduce their stellate sturgeon caviar export quotas in 2007 by over 25 percent (8). The countries bordering the Black Sea have adopted an even stricter policy regarding their sturgeon stocks maintaining a zero quota policy which has continued into 2008 (9). Whether these reduced quotas will prove sufficient to allow the stellate sturgeon\xe2\x80\x99s population to recover remains to be seen. ,fishing;overfishing;pollution; ,cites; ,3,1770,Somersiella sterreri,Parhippolyte sterreri,Sterrerí¢ŒóŒ»s cave shrimp (Parhippolyte sterreri),Animalia,Arthropoda,Crustacea,Decapoda,Hippolytidae,Parhippolyte (1),Male length (including rostrum): c. 15.3 mm (2)Female length (including rostrum): c. 30.7 mm (2),With so little known about this enigmatic species assessing the level of threats it faces is very challenging.

These perilous declines have largely been the result of the accidental introduction of the black rat (<i>Rattus rattus</i>) to the island which prey on the eggs and chicks. However two introduced birds the Indian mynah and red-vented bulbul also pose a significant threat to the monarch\xe2\x80\x99s survival. It is thought that the Indian mynah which was introduced to control wasps preys on eggs and chicks whereas the red-vented bulbul competes with the monarch for nest sites and territories (5).,In 1997 the total population was only 27 individuals. Since then a conservation programme was implemented and intensive surveys revealed the population had increased to 40 to 45 birds in 2004 (2) (3). The recovery plan is largely focused on the control of the black rat. During each breeding season a rat-baiting programme takes place on accessible Tahiti monarch territories (12 territories in 2006); the remainder live in remote areas that are extremely difficult to access. Trees which hold Tahiti monarch nests are fitted with metal rings to protect the nests from climbing rats and since 2001 the population has been stable or very slowly increasing and old territories are being reoccupied (6). ,invasive;pet; , ,2,0779,Turdus olivaceus helleri,Turdus helleri,Taita thrush (Turdus helleri),Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Turdidae,Turdus (1),Length: 20-22 cm (2),Decades of forest clearance for cultivation and non-native timber plantations have reduced the indigenous forest of the Taita Hills to a tiny fraction of its former range. Today the surviving forest patches on which the highly specialised Taita thrush depends remain under serious threat from clearance and degradation. As a result the Taita thrush is currently listed as Critically Endangered on the IUCN Red List. One of the smaller sub-populations also has a highly male-biased sex ratio which might have significant consequences for the subpopulation\xe2\x80\x99s long term survival\xa0(2)\xa0(3)\xa0(6) (7).,In cooperation with local communities considerable conservation work is underway in the Taita Hills. In order to restore existing forest fragments and hopefully enhance connectivity between them efforts are being made to reforest areas with indigenous seedlings. Farmers are also being educated in environmentally responsible agricultural practices and local people are being taught alternative income generating activities such as bee-keeping and butterfly rearing. In addition an ongoing collaborative research project is in place which will provide the ecological data necessary to implement appropriate conservation measures.

Its head was once a valued trophy of hunters and many local people depended on it as a source of meat (4).,Despite significant efforts to protect the tamaraw numbers remain alarmingly low (6).  The tamaraw is fully protected under Philippine law (1) and the Iglit-Baco National Park (now also known as the Mangyan Heritage Park (5)) was established for its protection (2) although this area is not exempt from being impacted by the threats mentioned above.  In 1979 the Tamaraw Conservation Program was initiated with the aim of safeguarding the tamaraw and its habitat undertaking population and habitat surveys reforestation programs and educational campaigns although there is some concern over how well any of these measures have been so far been achieved (6). ,hunting;poaching;disease; ,protected; ,3,1781,Lagarto Canario Moteado,Gallotia intermedia,Tenerife speckled lizard (Gallotia intermedia),Animalia,Chordata,Reptilia,Squamata,Lacertidae,Gallotia (1),Snout-vent length: up to 15 cm (2)Tail length: 28.3 cm (2),The Tenerife speckled lizard has an extremely restricted range with just 40 isolated populations occurring along a 9 kilometre stretch of the west coast of Tenerife and one further population in the south. The population of this species is thought to total no more than 600 individuals and is at risk from the effects of inbreeding (1).,The most important conservation measure for the Tenerife speckled lizard is the control of <strong>feral</strong> cat populations. Measures so far have included the use of fencing to exclude <strong>feral</strong> cats from the known habitat of the Tenerife speckled lizard (1).

The upper Gulf of California is not only home to this Critically Endangered species it is also the site of intensive commercial and artisanal fishing (7). Vaquitas become entangled in the gill nets and trawl nets that are used in these activities claiming the lives of an estimated 39 to 84 vaquitas each year (2). This is considered the principal threat to the vaquita\xe2\x80\x99s survival (7).,Time is quickly running out for the vaquita with a group of scientists in 2007 stating that they believed there were only two years remaining in which to find a solution to saving this species (4). Some measures have already been implemented; the Mexican government created the Upper Gulf of California and Colorado River Delta Biosphere Reserve in 1993 to protect the vaquita and other endangered species (2).

Shifting agriculture has cleared vast areas of forest and development and plantations have also played a part in habitat loss (7). In 1988 it was estimated that only four percent of Negros and eight percent of Panay remained forested (4). These birds have also been hunted for food and for collection for the pet trade in parts of their range and the isolated fragments of populations that remain are extremely vulnerable to any chance events such as the local failure of fruiting trees (4).,In 2001 the Visayan wrinkled hornbill was on the brink of extinction with only 60 to 80 breeding pairs remaining in the wild (8) (9). Fortunately effective conservation measures initiated by the Philippine Endemic Species Conservation Project (PESCP) saw the number of occupied nest holes on Panay increase to 1108 in 2008 (9). This was achieved primarily through a highly successful nest guarding scheme involving local communities (8) (9). Although it is not known how many Visayan wrinkled hornbills remain on Negros if any at all the success of the conservation measures on Panay offer considerable hope for the future of this species (8). ,loss;pet; , ,2,0797,Diomedea irrorata,Phoebastria irrorata,Waved albatross (Phoebastria irrorata),Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Procellariiformes,Diomedeidae,Phoebastria (1),3 í¢ŒóŒñ 4 kg (3),Like other albatross species the greatest threat to the waved albatross is human fishing activities. Many are unintentionally drowned by longline fishing boats; a fishing method that involves a single line up to 130 kilometres long with thousands of baited hooks attached to it being pulled behind a boat. Waved albatrosses scavenging in the ocean try to eat the bait from the line as it is set behind the boat but instead swallow the hooks and are dragged under and drowned (7). Currently waved albatross are only affected by longlining when feeding off the coast of Peru as industrial longline fishing is prohibited in the Galapagos Marine Reserve. However there is pressure from the fishing industry to allow longlining within the reserve which would have an extremely damaging impact on the population of waved albatross (8).,Espa\xc3\xb1ola is part of the Gal\xc3\xa1pagos National Park and Marine Reserve and World Heritage Site which means that this breeding site of the waved albatross is well protected. There are no introduced species on the island and tourism is well regulated. The other potential breeding site the Isla de la Plata is part of Machalilla National Park but does not have the same level of protection as Espa\xc3\xb1ola and therefore the albatross could benefit from increased protection of this island (5). ,fishing;pollution; ,protected; ,2,1798,Gorille,Gorilla gorilla,Western gorilla (Gorilla gorilla),Animalia,Chordata,Mammalia,Primates,Hominidae,Gorilla (1),Male height: up to 180 cm (2)Female height: up to 150 cm (2)Male weight: 140 kg (2)Female weight: 70 kg (2),The decline in gorilla numbers is mainly attributed to the loss and degradation of their forest habitat which has been relentlessly cleared to make way for agricultural and logging practices and to the Ebola virus (6).

In addition to the large-scale timber-harvesting operations that began in the 19th century the Western Ghats have also been impacted by clearance for agriculture and plantations. The forests are now mostly restricted to steep areas that are difficult to access (8).,Some populations of <i>Vateria indica</i> are found in forest reserves and small-scale replantation efforts are being made in some degraded rainforests and barren areas (1) (6). Although the status of this species is critical it apparently shows good regeneration where conditions permit hence adequate protection of areas from clearance and degradation could allow it to make a recovery (1). ,loss; , ,1,0804,White lauan,Parashorea malaanonan,White seraya (Parashorea malaanonan),Plantae,Tracheophyta,Magnoliopsida,Theales,Dipterocarpaceae,Parashorea (1),Height: to 61 m (2)Trunk diameter above butresses: 0.91 í¢ŒóŒñ 1.52 m (2),White seraya is an extremely important commercial timber (1) and as such has become critically endangered through over-harvesting and probably extensive illegal logging. In the Philippines large areas of forest had already been cleared by the end of the nineteenth century for agricultural expansion which continued throughout the twentieth century (7). However the most extensive and rapid deforestation in the latter half of the century has been caused by commercial logging with has particularly impacted the valuable primary lowland dipterocarp forests which shrunk from an estimated 10 million hectares in the 1950s to only one million by the late 1980s (7). Forest clearance and habitat degradation throughout Borneo and the Philippines may also be having a detrimental effect on the tree\xe2\x80\x99s natural pollinators reducing the rate at which the species can reproduce and recover its populations (4).,This threatened species is located in a proposed reserve site (1) which if awarded official reserve status in the future would confer some degree of protection to the species. The Philippines\xe2\x80\x99 Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR) has also established a <strong>genebank</strong> of economically useful <strong>endemic</strong> and endangered forest tree species including white seraya (8). This project has involved collecting and propagating the species to be maintained in an arboretum and gathering data on growth and survival of the species planted (8). A large scale project has also been initiated in Sabah Malaysia to rehabilitate 25000 hectares of logged forests using indigenous tree species such as dipterocarps in order to counteract atmospheric carbon dioxide (9). <i>Parashorea malaanonan</i> has been one of the main dipterocarp species planted to date (9). Indeed although such conservation efforts are not directed specifically at white seraya the tree is likely to benefit indirectly from a variety of such efforts to conserve lowland forests generally. Whether for environmental concerns or to protect the host of endangered species that inhabit lowland forests across Borneo and the Philippines conservation of such forests will undoubtedly help preserve this enormous tree which needs to be recognised for its crucial ecological importance as much as for its economic value. , , ,0,0805,imperial heron,Ardea insignis,White-bellied heron (Ardea insignis),Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Ciconiiformes,Ardeidae,Ardea (1),Length: 127 cm (2),For over a century the white-bellied heron has been at risk due to deforestation because its preferred habitat is mature forest (3).

In addition the white-bellied heron is vulnerable to disturbance and habitat degradation as a result of agricultural expansion human settlements and poaching (2) as well as overfishing (3).,The white-bellied heron population is extremely small at fewer than 250 mature individuals and is rapidly declining putting this species at severe risk of extinction (2). ,fragmentation;poaching;fishing;overfishing;pollution; ,protected; ,5,1806,Forbesí¢ŒóŒ»s kite,Leptodon forbesi,White-collared kite (Leptodon forbesi),Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Falconiformes,Accipitridae,Leptodon (1),550 - 580 g (2),With a total population so far estimated at perhaps fewer than 100 mature individuals and a highly restricted and fragmented range (3) (10) the white-collared kite may be the most endangered bird of prey in South America (6) and indeed is one of the rarest birds in the world (5). The <strong>Atlantic coastal forest</strong> of Brazil is highly threatened by habitat loss mainly in the form of clearance for sugarcane and coffee plantations and pressure from urbanisation (7) (8) (13). Within this species\xe2\x80\x99 range massive deforestation has drastically reduced forest cover to less than one percent of its former extent and the small remaining forest fragments are under continued threat from logging as well as from fires (3) (10). In addition a lack of knowledge about the white-collared kite whose very existence as a distinct species was still debated as recently as 2005 hinders efforts to conserve it (5) (6) (8).\xa0,The white-collared kite is listed on Appendix II of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) meaning that any international trade in the species should be carefully monitored (4). In addition a large area of Murici Alagoas is legally protected and organisations such as the Instituto para a Preserva\xc3\xa7\xc3\xa3o da Mata Atl\xc3\xa2ntica (IPMA) are working to create forest reserves on privately-owned land (3) (10).

The designation of Murici as a biological reserve and the protection of other forest areas (3) (10) (13) such as Mata do Coimbra Ibateguara Alagoas (12) will also be important to its continued survival.

The Cat Ba langur also has the support of Flora and Fauna International\xe2\x80\x99s Flagship Species Fund (5) and the Cat Hai District Women\xe2\x80\x99s Union who implemented a project entitled \xe2\x80\x98Contributing to Biodiversity Conservation in Cat Ba National Park through Community Activity\xe2\x80\x99 (7). ,fragmentation;hunting; ,protected; ,2,1809,Davisoní¢ŒóŒ»s ibis,Pseudibis davisoni,White-shouldered ibis (Pseudibis davisoni),Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Ciconiiformes,Threskiornithidae,Pseudibis (1),Size: 75 í¢ŒóŒñ 85 cm (2),The white-shouldered ibis has been left with an extremely small fragmented vulnerable population of fewer than an estimated 250 mature individuals after having suffered dramatic declines as a result of deforestation drainage of wetlands hunting and disturbance. Much of the species\xe2\x80\x99 historical decline is due to habitat loss through logging of lowland forest and drainage of wetlands for agriculture (most of the Mekong floodplain in southern Laos has been converted to rice-paddy) livestock-grazing grass-harvesting and development. Habitat destruction has been compounded by hunting for food and human disturbance which now pose the greatest threats to the species (2).,The white-shouldered ibis is legally protected in Indonesia Myanmar and East Malaysia (4) and occurs in several protected areas including Cat Tien National Park Vietnam where it probably breeds Ang Trapeang Thmor Cambodia and Xe Pian National Biodiversity Conservation Area (NBCA) and Dong Khanthung proposed NBCA Laos (2). BirdLife International's Cambodia Programme Office is working with relevant government departments to promote Western Siem Pang as a protected area a site that supports the only known potentially viable population (up to 70 individuals) of white-shouldered ibis in mainland Southeast Asia and which contains three other Critically Endangered birds. In partnership with local communities ongoing public awareness campaigns are being conducted in Laos and Cambodia to educate people about the status of these bird populations discourage persecution and establish activities to prevent further population declines (5). The governments of Laos and Vietnam are also having notable success in controlling gun ownership which is apparently benefiting populations of large waterbirds in some areas and may be helping the white-shouldered ibis (4). ,loss;hunting; ,protected; ,2,1810,Pava Aliblanca,Penelope albipennis,White-winged guan (Penelope albipennis),Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Galliformes,Cracidae,Penelope (1),Length: 85 cm (2),The initial decline in the white-winged guan was believed to result from overhunting which continues to be a threat today and which may also explain the species\xe2\x80\x99 disappearance from coastal areas. In addition the white-winged guan is under pressure from habitat destruction and fragmentation with forests being cleared for agriculture timber charcoal firewood and artisanal woodcrafts (2) (4) (5) (9) (10). Indeed over 90 percent of the original forest cover of the region may have already been removed (11) and the guan\xe2\x80\x99s decline was exacerbated after land reforms in 1968 allowed greater public access to privately owned land (4) (5). After its rediscovery in 1977 the white-winged guan was believed to number only a few hundred birds at most and is estimated at around 150 to 250 individuals today (2) (4) (5) (7) with around 75 birds held in captivity in 2007 (2). In addition to its small size and restricted range the population is also severely fragmented with only a small number of individuals known from most sites (2) (4).,The white-winged guan has been the subject of a range of conservation efforts since its rediscovery. International trade in the species is banned under its listing on Appendix I of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) (3) and the white-winged guan and its habitat are legally protected within the Laquipampa Wildlife Refuge an area established specifically to protect this species (2) (7) (10). In 1980 a captive breeding programme was set up (4) (12) (13) (14) (15) and the first captive-bred birds were reintroduced to Chaparri Private Conservation Area a community owned and managed reserve in 2001 (2) (9) (14) (16). Training programmes were provided for park guards (2) (10) (13) and the programme has also involved environmental education and outreach in local communities (2) (7) (12) (14) (17). The released birds have started breeding successfully in the wild with over 50 wild-born chicks already added to the population (2) (15) (16) (17). ,fragmentation;hunting; ,cites;captive breeding;protected; ,2,3811,Ancylus filosa; Rhodacme filosa,Rhodacmea filosa,Wicker ancylid (Rhodacmea filosa),Animalia,Mollusca,Gastropoda,Hygrophila,Planorbidae,Rhodacmea (1),Rhodacmea (1),[],[] , , ,0,0812,Mongolian wild camel,Camelus ferus,Wild Bactrian camel (Camelus ferus),Animalia,Chordata,Mammalia,Cetartiodactyla,Camelidae,Camelus (1),600 í¢ŒóŒñ 1000 kg (2),Wild Bactrian camels have been heavily hunted for their meat and hide over the centuries (4) and today only a few highly fragmented populations persist (1). These camels continue to be persecuted mainly as they are seen as competition with domestic livestock for the precious water and grazing of the desert (1). Bactrian camels persisted in China even though the Gashun Gobi desert (Lop Nur) was used as a nuclear test site for 45 years (3) today further habitat loss has occurred with the development of a gas pipe-line in the north of the reserve (1) and highly toxic illegal mining (3). Competition with domestic camels and livestock as well as <strong>hybridisation</strong> with domestic camels poses a further threat to the survival of the unique Bactrian camel (1). The total population is predicted to undergo an 80% reduction over the next three generations prompting the species to be listed as Critically Endangered by the World Conservation Union (IUCN) (1).,Areas of the Gobi and Gashun Gobi desert (Lop Nur) where the Bactrian camel remain are protected by the Great Gobi Reserve in Mongolia which was established in 1982 and by the newly established national reserve \xe2\x80\x98Lop Nur Wild Camel Reserve\xe2\x80\x99 in China (1) (7). Both governments have agreed to protect this trans-boundary migrating species in a historic move (3). A captive breeding programme based in Mongolia and run by the Wild Camel Protection Foundation began in 2003 in an effort to safeguard the future of this fascinating animal (3). Recent studies of dromedary (one-humped) camels (<em>Camelus dromedarius</em>) have revealed an extraordinary immune system; camel milk has been found to arrest diabetes in humans and has proved to be a substitute for insulin with these results prompting hopes that further studies of the wild Bactrian camel may yield similarly remarkable discoveries (3) (7). ,loss;pet; ,captive breeding;protected; ,2,2813,Plagoptere Argente,Plagopterus argentissimus,Woundfin (Plagopterus argentissimus),Animalia,Chordata,Actinopterygii,Cypriniformes,Cyprinidae,Plagopterus (1),Length: up to 10 cm (2),From being the most abundant species in the Virgin River the woundfin has suffered a dramatic population decline (2). Loss and fragmentation of its habitat due to human activities is thought to be a major contributing factor in this decline (1) (4). The damming of the rivers and use of the water for agriculture and mining have also led to changes in the flow regimes of the rivers in the woundfin\xe2\x80\x99s range (2) (4).,A major priority for the conservation of the woundfin is the protection and monitoring of its remaining habitat (4). Research is also being carried out in order to refine captive breeding methods so that this species can be re-introduced back into its historic range. However previous attempts to reintroduce the woundfin have proved unsuccessful (4). ,loss;fragmentation; ,cites;captive breeding; ,2,2814,Dabryí¢ŒóŒ»s sturgeon,Acipenser dabryanus,Yangtze sturgeon (Acipenser dabryanus),Animalia,Chordata,Actinopterygii,Acipenseriformes,Acipenseridae,Acipenser (1),16 kg (2),The Yangtze sturgeon is at risk from over-fishing pollution and habitat degradation and loss. An important factor in its decline was the construction of the Gezhouba Dam across the Yangtze River at Yichang in Hubei Province in 1981. As this prevented upstream migration necessary for spawning the Yangtze sturgeon is now only found above the dam (2).,Conservation of this fish is now urgent with emphasis needed on habitat protection capture control and stock replenishment. This sturgeon species spawns earlier in life than most sturgeons and therefore has aquaculture potential for caviar production. Controlled production of the Yangtze sturgeon could both reduce fishing levels and allow <strong>reintroductions</strong> of fish back into the river (2). ,loss;fishing;pollution; , ,3,0815,buff-headed capuchin; buffy-headed capuchin; golden-bellied capuchin,Cebus xanthosternos,Yellow-breasted capuchin (Cebus xanthosternos),Animalia,Chordata,Mammalia,Primates,Cebidae,Cebus (1),Male head-body length: 39 í¢ŒóŒñ 42 cm (2)Female head-body length: 36 í¢ŒóŒñ 38 cm (2)Tail length: 38 í¢ŒóŒñ 49 cm (3)Female weight: 1.4 í¢ŒóŒñ 3.4 kg (3)Male weight: 1.3 í¢ŒóŒñ 4.8 kg (3),The yellow-breasted capuchin is seriously threatened with extinction and the population is still declining.

It occurs within a number of protected areas and a species Recovery Plan was initiated in 1998. This programme continues today and is making progress in five key areas namely: controlling trade conserving key habitats removing the market demand for wild birds by establishing captive breeding facilities research into ecology and population dynamics and awareness campaigns (4). ,loss;pet; ,cites;captive breeding;protected; ,2,3
