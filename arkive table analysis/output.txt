Alcatraz de Abbott; Piquero de Abbott,Papasula abbotti,Abbott's booby (Papasula abbotti),Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Pelecaniformes,Sulidae,Papasula (1),Length: 79 cm (2),Phosphate mining on Christmas Island in the 1960s and 70s caused the destruction of a third of Abbott's booby nesting habitat and has led to the subsequent deterioration of the remaining forest (4). Birds are strongly attached to nest sites and clearings are more exposed to wind turbulence which has a detrimental effect on breeding success and causes higher adult mortality (6). Recent development proposals for the island have again raised concern over the viability of remaining breeding habitat (5).,The majority of Abbott's booby nest sites occur within the Christmas Island National Park which was established in 1980 and covers 63 percent of the island (6). Nest site locations are monitored and the regeneration of previously cleared forest has occurred on much of the island (5). Although mining was resumed in 1990 it only involved the reworking of previously mined areas (6). The continued preservation and ban on clearing of the unique Christmas Island rainforest will be the key to the future viability of the Abbott's booby population (5). , , ,0,0
Abbotâs duiker,Cephalophus spadix,Abbottâs duiker (Cephalophus spadix),Animalia,Chordata,Mammalia,Cetartiodactyla,Bovidae,Cephalophus (1),50 â 60 kg (2),Like many other duikers Abbott\xe2\x80\x99s duiker is being impacted by a combination of hunting and habitat destruction (1) (2) (5).\xa0Hunted for its meat Abbott\xe2\x80\x99s duiker falls prey to snares laid in the forests it inhabits even within so-called protected areas (1) (7) while suitable habitat is gradually encroached upon by agriculture and logging (1) (2) (5).\xa0These human activities have resulted in the extinction of Abbott\xe2\x80\x99s duiker in areas where it once occurred and in 2008 the total population of Abbott\xe2\x80\x99s duiker was estimated at fewer than 1500 individuals (1).,Although Abbott\xe2\x80\x99s duiker occurs within several protected areas such as the Kilimanjaro National Park Udzungwa Mountains National Park and New Dabaga/Ulangambi Forest Reserve this does not completely protect this duiker from the threats of habitat loss and illegal hunting (1) (2) (5).\xa0In the Southern Highlands of Tanzania there are current efforts to employ hunters in environmental education initiatives in exchange for the cessation of hunting.\xa0The Abbott\xe2\x80\x99s duiker is also being used as a flagship species in village education programmes.\xa0This will hopefully be beneficial for many forest-dwelling animals including the Abbott\xe2\x80\x99s duiker (1).\xa0The expansion of certain protected areas to incorporate other important forests inhabited by Abbott\xe2\x80\x99s duiker (1) in addition to the enforcement of hunting bans within those areas (7) may be essential if this Endangered duiker is to survive. ,hunting; ,protected; ,1,1

Adelaide pigmy blue-tongue skink; pygmy bluetongue,Tiliqua adelaidensis,Adelaide pygmy bluetongue skink (Tiliqua adelaidensis),Animalia,Chordata,Reptilia,Squamata,Scincidae,Tiliqua (1),Male snout-vent length: 3.8 - 10.6 cm (2)Female snout-vent length: 8.8 - 10.7 cm (2)Tail length: 2.2 - 7.9 cm (2),The Adelaide pygmy bluetongue skink was once feared to be the first of Australia\xe2\x80\x99s approximately 700 reptiles to become extinct since European colonization. Thankfully it was rediscovered in 1992 after 33 years of being presumed extinct (3). Currently only ten small populations of the Adelaide pygmy bluetongue skinkare known to exist (6). Arguably Australia\xe2\x80\x99s most enigmatic reptile its scarcity can be attributed to its unique ecology as well as population declines due to extensive habitat destruction (2)(3).,The South Australia Department of Environment and Conservation has produced a National Recovery Plan for the Adelaide pygmy bluetongue skink with the overall objective to achieve down-listing of the species from Endangered to Vulnerable within 10 years. The plan details actions such as ensuring remaining habitat is protected from any further degradation and undertaking field studies to establish the skink\xe2\x80\x99s habitat requirements (6). At present all populations of the Adelaide pygmy bluetongue skink occur on private land making the establishment of agreements with landowners an essential part of any plan and incentives may be offered to landowners to become involved in establishing sanctuaries for the Adelaide pygmy bluetongue skink on their land (6). , ,protected; ,0,1

black-footed penguin; jackass penguin,Spheniscus demersus,African penguin (Spheniscus demersus),Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Sphenisciformes,Spheniscidae,Spheniscus (1),Length: 60 - 70 cm (2),The population of the African penguin has declined and it is estimated that its current size is a mere 10 percent of what it was at the turn of the 20th Century. Originally the fall in numbers was the result of the over-collection of eggs for food and disturbance caused by the collection of <strong>guano</strong> for fertiliser. Today however depleted fish stocks due to over-fishing and the risk of oil pollution are the most pertinent threats to the survival of the African penguin (5); a recent oil spill affected around 40 percent of the population.\xa0 Predation by Cape fur seals (<em>Arctocephalus pusillus</em>) and competition with them for food and breeding sites as well as shark predation has also had severe effects on African penguin numbers (2). The ongoing and rapid decline of the African penguin led to the species being uplisted from Vulnerable to Endangered on the IUCN Red List in 2010 (2).,The African penguin is protected by its listing on Appendix II of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) (3) and on Appendix II of the Convention on Migratory Species (CMS) (4). All of the breeding areas of the African penguin in South Africa are protected as National Parks or Nature Reserves and the collection of <strong>guano</strong> or eggs is no longer permitted. The recovery of rescued oiled African penguins has also been shown to be successful. Populations need further monitoring and the possibility of conserving fish stocks is under investigation amongst other measures if the future of Africa\xe2\x80\x99s only penguin is to be secured (2). ,fishing;pet;pollution; ,cites;protected; ,3,2

The habitat has been lost and now regeneration is insufficient to replace lost populations (1). Illegal logging continues to decimate the remaining populations (2).,Urgent regulation of logging is necessary including the employment of Forestry Stewardship Council regulations on harvesting. In Ghana some enrichment planting is being practised where suitable areas with low numbers of African teak are planted with African teak seedlings but conservation of current populations is a priority (2). , , ,0,0

Cape hunting dog; painted hunting dog,Lycaon pictus,African wild dog (Lycaon pictus),Animalia,Chordata,Mammalia,Carnivora,Canidae,Lycaon (1),18 - 34 kg (2),African wild dogs require large home ranges to support viable populations and recent habitat fragmentation has caused a population decline (4). African wild dogs traditionally have a reputation for attacking livestock and despite this rarely occurring in practice they are therefore often persecuted wherever they come into contact with humans (2) (4). In addition road accidents and incidental snaring have recently become an important cause of mortality (2). These wild dogs are susceptible to disease; particularly those carried by domestic dogs such as canine distemper and rabies. A final threat that keeps African wild dog populations low is competition and predation with the other large carnivores of the African savanna such as lions and spotted hyaenas (6).,The current population of African wild dogs is estimated to be less than 5500 individuals (2). The majority of dogs are found in medium sized populations which are extremely vulnerable to sudden environmental change. Due to their expansive home ranges large areas of contiguous habitat are the key to the survival of this species and it is estimated that protected areas need to be greater than 10000 square kilometres in order to prevent detrimental contact with local human settlements (2) (4). Consequently even most of the larger reserves cannot fully contain African wild dog packs leading to clashes with humans (2). Preventing persecution through education is also a priority of the conservation action plan (2) (4) in an effort to preserve this most intriguing and unique <strong>canid</strong>. ,fragmentation;disease;pet; ,protected; ,3,1

Animalia,Loxops coccineus,Akepa (Loxops coccineus),Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Fringillidae,Loxops (1),Length: 10Â cm (2),With its dependence on large mature trees the extensive forest clearance that has occurred on Hawaii has had a catastrophic effect on the akepa. Not only have significant numbers of mature trees been lost to logging but the remaining exposed trees have become more vulnerable to windfall. Despite reforestation efforts the planted trees take decades to develop natural cavities and cannot possibly provide the akepa with nesting habitat fast enough to offset its rapid population decline (2) (3).,Listed as Endangered by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service in 1970 the akepa was one of the species targeted in the 1982 Hawaii Forest Bird Recovery Plan leading to the improved protection and management of its habitat (3). A number of protected areas currently support akepa populations in particular Hakalau Forest National Wildlife Refuge which contains large numbers. Within these areas reforestation efforts are helping to restore this species\xe2\x80\x99 habitat in the long-term while artificial nesting boxes are providing a promising short-term benefit to the akepa\xe2\x80\x99s survival (2) (3). ,disease; ,captive breeding;protected; ,1,2
Hemignathus wilsoni,Hemignathus munroi,Akiapola'au (Hemignathus munroi),Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Drepanididae,Hemignathus (1),Length: 14 cm (2),As with many species on Hawaii the \xe2\x80\x98Akiapola\xe2\x80\x99au is threatened by deforestation and habitat degradation due to livestock grazing and is also preyed upon by introduced rats and feral cats. The introduction of mosquitoes to Hawaii has resulted in the spread of avian diseases which confine many bird species including the \xe2\x80\x98Akiapola\xe2\x80\x99au to higher elevations. This species has a low reproductive rate and is slow to recover from population reductions (2).,Relatively large \xe2\x80\x98Akiapola\xe2\x80\x99au populations are found within the boundaries of Ka\xe2\x80\x99u Forest Reserve and Hakalau Forest National Wildlife Refuge. Outside these areas some habitat is being restored (2) and young koa forests on the volcano of Mauna Loa now support high densities of Akiapolaau (6). It is hoped that the \xe2\x80\x98Akiapola\xe2\x80\x99au might be <strong>re-introduced</strong> into other newly restored habitat. Plans to restore corridors of habitat between areas of forest occupied by the \xe2\x80\x98Akiapola\xe2\x80\x99au may reduce the damaging effects of habitat fragmentation including <strong>inbreeding depression</strong> (2). ,disease; , ,1,0

The resilience of the wood is evident from roofing tiles that are still in good condition despite being between 130 - 150 years old (2). Lumbering in Chile began towards the end of the 16th Century and continued right up to 1976 when the species was declared a National Monument and the cutting of trees was therefore prohibited (7). The massive over-exploitation of the alerce caused population numbers to be decimated and by the early 1900s a third of the <em>Fitzroya</em> forests had been lost (1). The naturally slow regeneration of this species means that any timber harvest is unsustainable and despite logging bans the species has not shown any sign of recovery (2). Today the coastal populations appear to be declining although the direct cause is unclear; large tracts of dead white stems have been found although the time of death in many of these stands is unknown (7).,Logging of <em>Fitzroya cupressoides</em> is prohibited throughout the range of this magnificent tree and international trade is banned by its listing on Appendix I of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) (1). In collaboration with the Royal Botanic Gardens Edinburgh the University of Santiago is carrying out research into the conditions required for regeneration in order to assist propagation of these trees (8). The Global Trees Campaign is also involved in initiatives to restore and conserve remnant forests (6). The alerce has a long history in Chile and it is hoped that these efforts will help to restore the ancient forests to some of their former glory. , ,cites; ,0,1

Although clearance of habitat for farming was the main cause of its decline in the early 20th century in more recent times large numbers of this species have been removed by collectors (7) (8).,There are not known to be any specific conservation measures in place for the Alexandria cycad but it is listed on Appendix I of CITES which permits trade only under exceptional circumstances (3). , ,cites; ,0,1

In addition predation by introduced mammalian predators such as dogs cats and mongooses poses a further threat to the survival of this species (4). Mongooses were introduced in the 1980s in an attempt to control the number of habu pit vipers (<i>Trimeresurus flavoviridis</i>) on the island; they have however devastated other species\xe2\x80\x99 populations instead (3).,The Amami rabbit is classified as a Japanese National Monument and as such receives protection from hunting and capture (3). However habitat loss is currently the major threat to the survival of this rare species and the protection of remaining forests will be the key to securing the future of both this unique rabbit and other members of Amami\xe2\x80\x99s natural heritage (3). , , ,0,0

Andean mountain cat; mountain cat.,Leopardus jacobita,Andean cat (Leopardus jacobita),Animalia,Chordata,Mammalia,Carnivora,Felidae,Oreailurus (1),4 kg (2),It is not clear whether the rarity of the Andean cat is a natural phenomenon or attributable to human actions. Alternatively it may simply be a misperception resulting from lack of observations (2). Pelts of this species have been seen in local markets occasionally killed by herders who carry guns (2). The high Andean Indians appear to have little knowledge of this species and the only pelts observed to be used in local ceremonies have been those of the pampas cat (5). There are no records of international trade of this species either. It is therefore thought that hunting of the Andean cat is primarily carried out to protect local cattle (1). The common threat of habitat destruction common worldwide does not apply here as there have been no significant changes in land-use of the high Andes over the last 2000 years. If anything the human population has decreased in these regions (2).,International trade of this species is prohibited by its listing on Appendix I of CITES (3) and according to national legislation the Andean cat is fully protected throughout its range (2). There is a huge gap in our knowledge of this species and how to best protect it. However since the publication of the Cat Action Treasury Plan there have been substantial increases in research efforts (1) (7). The Cat Action Treasury has sponsored surveys to determine the status of this species and improve our understanding of this cat in order to inform conservation measures (8). These surveys confirmed the rarity of this species. The Andean cat has been upgraded from Vulnerable to Endangered on the IUCN Red List (1) (7). It has been suggested by the Andean Cat Alliance (AGA) previously the Committee for the Conservation of the Andean Cat (COCGA) that because this cat needs large areas to live successfully and its range extends over the Andes through international borders a multinational cooperative approach is necessary for its long-term conservation (5). AGA has launched a multinational project to collate and analyse data on the on the Andean cat in order to initiate immediate conservation efforts and in 2004 a conservation action plan was drawn up for the species.

Although this species remains relatively abundant at some localities a multitude of threats including expanding human settlements agriculture logging livestock grazing charcoal manufacture and the spread of invasive eucalyptus are causing its population to decline. The pressures have already proven severe enough to cause local extinctions around Fort Dauphin near the southern limit of the Angel\xe2\x80\x99s Madagascar frog\xe2\x80\x99s range (1).,While there are no known conservation measures specifically targeting Angel\xe2\x80\x99s Madagascar frog it is found in two protected areas the Andohahela and Midongy-du-Sud National Parks (1). Nevertheless increased protection of this species\xe2\x80\x99 habitat along with educational programs to inform local people of how best to manage the forests sustainably are vital measures that must be implemented if Angel\xe2\x80\x99s Madagascar frog is to be conserved (6). ,invasive; ,protected; ,1,1

In rural areas sewage is rarely treated before being discarded and industrial and domestic waste is sometimes disposed of in caves. Another threat comes from over-harvesting of freshwater which may lead to <strong>saline waters</strong> creeping into the normally freshwater zone. The human population of the Yucatan peninsula is growing so a greater and greater strain on water resources can be expected in the future. Another potential threat is the modification and/or the intensive use of this fish\xe2\x80\x99s habitat by humans for recreational or tourism purposes (2).,There are currently no conservation measures targeting the Anguila ciega. ,pollution; , ,1,0

armoured chameleon; stump tailed chameleon,Brookesia perarmata,Antsingy leaf chameleon (Brookesia perarmata),Animalia,Chordata,Reptilia,Squamata,Chamaeleonidae,Brookesia (1),Length: up to 11cm (2),Chameleons are favoured as pets across the world due to their fascinating appearance and behaviour. Collection and trade has therefore taken its toll on many chameleon species but international trade in this species is now prohibited (9). However habitat degradation remains a threat even though the species is found within a national park. As this species depends on the presence of leaf litter for food shelter and laying its eggs and also on low shrubs and seedlings for roosting at night its survival is dependent on maintaining the existing vegetation structure within the Tsingy forests (5) (10).,The Antsingy leaf chameleon is listed on Appendix I of the Convention on International Trade of Endangered Species (CITES) and as such international trade of this species is illegal (3). Its survival is not immediately threatened in the wild although it is still justifiably a conservation priority because of its limited range and the continued degradation of its favoured habitats within the national park (1) (2) (10). ,pet; ,cites; ,1,1

Furthermore the extent and quality of its habitat on Borneo is continuing to decline (1).,The Gunung Mulu National Park home to the only known population of the Api dwarf toad is a protected area and the most studied tropical karst area in the world.

Numbers of Apolinar\xe2\x80\x99s wren have indeed declined significantly in the last 50 to 70 years primarily due to a 95 percent loss in habitat (3). A significant cause of this habitat destruction is the burning of wetlands for agriculture mainly onion cultivation and cattle-farming. With agriculture also frequently comes the use of insecticides and other chemicals resulting in a reduction in this bird\xe2\x80\x99s insect prey and posing a toxic threat to the bird. In areas around the capital Bogot\xc3\xa1 remaining wetland habitats are at risk from human settlement and highway development and reed-harvesting and tourism also pose minor threats (1).,Apolinar\xe2\x80\x99s wren occurs in El Cocuy National Park Boyac\xc3\xa1 and in Sumap\xc3\xa1z National Park Cundinamarca which may offer protection against the threat of habitat loss (2). ,loss; ,captive breeding; ,1,1

Unfortunately the species\xe2\x80\x99 dependence upon visiting waterholes leaves it vulnerable to ambush by poachers (3). Human migrations to urban areas have increased in Oman in recent years resulting in domestic goats being left to become feral which now forage in areas that were once the realm of the tahr. Additionally several roads and buildings have been constructed near and within the tahr\xe2\x80\x99s range which are new potential sources of disturbance pollution and habitat fragmentation. In particular plans for mineral extraction in southern parts of the range could result in significant habitat loss (6). Tahr populations in UAE appear to be especially localised and possibly isolated. The concern is that isolation of sub-populations will lead to the diminished genetic variation associated with inbreeding which in turn results in increased susceptibility to disease and decreased fertility spelling disaster for the Arabian tahr in UAE (3).,In 1973 efforts were initiated to protect the Arabian tahr and in 1975 active protection was granted over a wide range of the eastern Hajar Mountains of Oman with local men recruited as rangers under the Office of the Advisor for Conservation of the Environment (6). Unfortunately this area still awaits to be awarded official status by a Royal Decree with an approved funded and implemented management plan (6) (7). However in 2009 Wadi Wurayah Fujairah home to the Arbaian tahr and other rare and endangered species was officially declared as the United Arab Emirates\xe2\x80\x99 first protected mountain area (8). ,loss;fragmentation;hunting;disease;pet;pollution; ,captive breeding;protected; ,6,2

The IUCN who assessed the conservation status of this lizard also state the possible development of hydroelectric projects and mining as a future threat to this species (1). The low reproductive potential of the Aran rock lizard and its restricted distribution only act to enhance the devastating effects that such threats may have on the population (3).,The Aran rock lizard is listed on Appendix III of the Bern Convention a convention which aims to conserve wild flora and fauna and their natural habitats and to promote European co-operation in that field (4). Wild animal species on Appendix III are protected but can be exploited if regulated in accordance with the convention (4). It is yet to be seen whether this level of protection is sufficient to ensure the survival of this Endangered reptile. , ,protected; ,0,1

Local people use this species to treat rheumatism and over-collection for this reason is also a threat (1). Habitat destruction through urban development road construction and livestock grazing pose further threats to survival; accelerated erosion has been observed at both known sites of this species (2). The total population is thought to have decreased by as much as 50% over the past 50 years; although around 5000 individuals still remain (1).,International trade in wild-taken plants and seeds of the artichoke cactus is banned by its listing on Appendix I of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) (3). The species is also protected under Mexican law (4) although illegal collection does still occur (1).

Agriculture has progressively encroached upon this habitat while heavy grazing by livestock which has been particularly intense since the introduction of sheep has limited its natural regeneration. This has been exacerbated in areas where <em>Polylepis</em> woodland is exploited for firewood charcoal production and logging and where competitive exotic trees such as <em>Eucalyptus</em> have been introduced (2). Consequently around 50 percent of natural woodlands have been lost from Abra Malaga in Peru and an alarming 26 percent of original diversity may have already been lost (4) (6). Facing such intense pressure the ash-breasted tit-tyrant has undergone a drastic decline and now the population is near critically low levels (2). \xa0,Although found in a number of protected areas including the actively managed Huascar\xc3\xa1n National Park the ash-breasted tit-tyrant urgently requires conservation action (2). Recognising this the American Bird Conservancy in collaboration with Asociaci\xc3\xb3n Ecosistemas Andinos a Peruvian conservation organisation is working to preserve and restore <em>Polylepis</em> habitat. Over 120000 plants have been successfully planted while local families have been provided with alternative firewood (7).The ash-breasted tit-tyrant will also benefit from the implementation of a wealth of proposed measures including improved land-use management and community awareness programmes (2). Furthermore two key areas have been identified for the conservation of <em>Polylepis</em> specialist birds and it is hoped that with the implementation of conservation measures in these areas the future of many rare species will be secured (8). ,loss;pet; ,protected; ,2,1
Animalia,Oceanodroma homochroa,Ashy storm-petrel (Oceanodroma homochroa),Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Procellariiformes,Hydrobatidae,Oceanodroma (1),37 g (3),Between the 1880s and 1970s the breeding population of ashy storm-petrels at the South Farallon Islands was stable. However in the early 1990s a twenty-year study reported an alarming decline of 42 percent in the population (2) (3). More recently these findings have been corroborated by other studies showing continued declines on South Farallon and also at several other important breeding sites (2). No one single cause is considered responsible for the decline but rather a combination of several negative pressures. This includes predation of petrels by gulls and owls and on the larger islands introduced mammals such as rats mice and cats. In particular rapid growth in the population of predatory gulls is of considerable concern at many of the nesting sites. Other reported threats include oil and chemical pollution in foraging areas light pollution from fishing vessels increasing the vulnerability of petrels to predation ingestion of plastics and human disturbance. Furthermore there is long-term concern that climate change may disturb the ocean currents and processes of coastal upwelling which form an integral part of a food web supporting ashy storm-petrels and many other organisms (2) (3).,In light of its restricted range and a current population size that is almost certainly less than the 5000 to 10000 breeding birds estimated in the early to mid-1990s the ashy-storm petrel is listed as Endangered on the IUCN Red List (1) (2). Fortunately despite the threats described most of the breeding colonies are on islands either protected from development or subject to sensitive management (2) (3). Current conservation proposals include eradication of all introduced predators from nesting islands an investigation of the impacts of light chemical and plastics pollution and continued monitoring of population trends (2). Presently the ashy storm-petrel is designated by the California Department of Fish and Game as a Bird Species of Conservation Concern but as of May 2008 it is also under review for protection under the Endangered Species Act (ESA) (6). If listed under the ESA the ashy storm-petrel will benefit from the compulsory development of a recovery plan protection and restoration of critical habitat scientific research and public education (7) (8). ,fishing;pet;pollution; ,protected;endangered species act; ,3,2

Indeed the total world population is thought to almost certainly be less than 4000 individuals perhaps considerably less but there is also a very real possibility that no pure-bred wild Asian buffalo exist anymore. Unfortunately accurate assessment of numbers is problematic due to the difficulty of distinguishing pure animals from free-ranging domestic or feral buffalo (1). Nevertheless the species is generally accepted to be undergoing very serious declines as a result of hunting habitat loss and degradation as agricultural land use expands and <strong>hybridisation</strong> with domestic and/or feral buffalo (1) (3). Other threats include diseases and parasites transmitted by domestic livestock and competition for food and water between wild and domestic buffalo (1).,Wild Asian buffalo are listed under Appendix III of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) in Nepal which limits the quantity of animal products that can be exported and imported across international borders but this does not regulate domestic trade (4). Nevertheless the species is legally protected across its range in Bhutan Nepal India and Thailand and it is thought that pure-bred populations may occur in several protected areas (1). Existing conservation programmes are focusing on preserving the buffalo\xe2\x80\x99s diminishing habitat but this is becoming increasingly difficult as human populations expand and encroachment continues (3).

Japanese crested Ibis; Toki,Nipponia nippon,Asian crested ibis (Nipponia nippon),Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Ciconiiformes,Threskiornithidae,Nipponia (1),Length: 55 - 78.5 cm (2),Although abundant throughout Eastern Asia up until a century ago deforestation and habitat destruction caused the Asian crested ibis population to crash during the 20th century. When the last wild birds in Japan were taken into captivity in 1981 the species was believed to be extinct in the wild but later that year a tiny population of seven birds was discovered in a remote mountainous area of Shaanxi Province in China (4) (5) (9). Thanks to the implementation of a conservation programme and the enforcement of laws protecting habitat the wild population had risen to more than 600 wild individuals by 2009 (4) (5). However although its population continues to increase there are still fears for the Asian crested ibis with various factors still threatening to undermine this species\xe2\x80\x99 recovery. Indeed the ongoing conversion of rice fields to dry wheat production is rapidly reducing the availability of feeding areas. Additional threats include the use of agrochemicals at feeding sites occasional hunting and low genetic diversity (4) (9).,In addition to its legal protection in China numerous conservation measures have been introduced since the Asian crested ibis\xe2\x80\x99 rediscovery including the protection of nesting sites and the periodic prohibition of logging hunting with firearms and usage of agrochemicals (4) (9). As of 2009 there are around 500 birds occurring within several captive breeding programmes (5). Following the successes of these programmes captive bred birds are now being used to reintroduce the Asian crested ibis to parts of its original range in China and Japan (4) (5) (10). ,hunting; ,captive breeding; ,1,1

Vast tracts of land have been logged or simply cleared to accommodate the growing human population in the region (2). Such disturbance from infrastructure development can also cause increased stress and confusion amongst elephants (8). Elephant populations have become increasingly isolated in the fragmented habitat that remains often coming into conflict with local farmers (7). Crops are damaged and lives lost; up to 300 people a year are killed by elephants in India (4) leading to retaliation on local elephants (9). Poaching for ivory is also a threat and because only males have tusks populations can become extremely skewed towards females thus affecting breeding rates (2).,The Asian elephant is protected from international trade by its listing on Appendix I of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) although illegal poaching remains a problem (4). Many elephants occur within protected reserves but these are often too small to accommodate them leading to human-elephant conflict (4). Many elephant populations are also found along international borders where management may be weak and a lack of trans-boundary cooperation also hinders elephant protection and management (8). The creation of wildlife corridors to extend reserve lands together with the cessation of poaching are just some of the conservation steps needed to secure the future of the Asian elephant (9). The World Wildlife Fund (WWF) launched the Asian Rhino and Elephant Action Strategy (AREAS) in 1998 to address these issues and this multifaceted conservation programme is also working with local people to reduce conflict with these magnificent animals (8). ,loss;hunting;poaching; ,cites;protected;wwf; ,3,3
Indian tapir; Malay tapir; Malayan tapir,Tapirus indicus,Asian tapir (Tapirus indicus),Animalia,Chordata,Mammalia,Perissodactyla,Tapiridae,Tapirus (1),250 â 540 kg (2),Widely abundant in Southern Myanmar Thailand Malaysia and Indonesia in the early 1930s Asian tapir populations have since rapidly declined and now survive only as isolated populations in remote or protected areas. Habitat destruction poses the predominant threat as a result of land being cleared for human settlement and agriculture and rivers being dammed and land flooded for hydroelectric development (11). In Sumatra uncontrolled illegal logging still occurs. The tapir population is strongest in Malaysia where deforestation has greatly declined (1).,Protective game laws exist in Thailand Myanmar Malaysia and Indonesia with varying success (11). In Malaysia the Asian tapir has been given total protection since 1955 under the Wild Animals and Birds Ordinance and law enforcement has generally been effective. The use of steel wire snares has been banned here with stiff penalties if caught. However ongoing monitoring of the illegal tapir trade across the range of this species is crucial (2). Asian tapirs can be found in a number of protected areas including the Huai Kha Khaeng Wildlife Sanctuary and the Khao Sok National Park in Thailand 12 protected areas in the Western Forest Complex along the Thai-Myanmar border (1) and the Way Kambas National Park in Sumatra which contains around 200 individuals (11). However much of the suitable habitat that remains in Sumatra does not lie within protected areas and a large proportion of the tapir population occurs outside of reserves. Conservation efforts should not therefore be restricted to national parks but should endeavour to involve the cooperation of local people across the species\xe2\x80\x99 range (11). ,hunting; ,protected; ,1,1
Asian brown tortoise; Asian giant tortoise; black giant tortoise; Burmese brown tortoise; Burmese mountain tortoise; six-legged tortoise,Manouria emys,Asian tortoise (Manouria emys),Animalia,Chordata,Reptilia,Testudines,Testudinidae,Manouria (1),M. e. emys carapace length: up to 50 cm (2)M. e. emys weight: up to 20 kg (2)M. e. phayrei carapace length: up to 60 cm (2)M. e. phayrei weight: up to 37 kg (2),Like other Asian turtles and tortoises this species is severely threatened by over-harvesting and exploitation for the food and pet trade compounded by habitat destruction. Most records indicate that Asian tortoise populations are sparse and extremely fragmented (6). Sadly being such a large species the Asian tortoise is a relatively easy target for hunters and collectors (4) and its fairly high market value makes it a much sought after species (2).,International trade is controlled by the Asian tortoise\xe2\x80\x99s listing on CITES Appendix II (6). However despite the species being uplisted from \xe2\x80\x98Vulnerable\xe2\x80\x99 to \xe2\x80\x98Endangered\xe2\x80\x99 on the IUCN Red List in 2000 the legal export quota from Peninsula Malaysia was raised from 50 wild caught specimens in 1999 to 200 in 2000 and to 500 in 2002 (3) (6). In 2006 this quota was reduced to 400 (3) but this still seems too high for a species facing possible extinction. Although imports are now totally banned in the European Community this has only served to shift the trade towards Japan and the U.S. (6). The Asian brown tortoise (<i>M. e. emys</i>) is legally protected in Sabah Malaysia under the Wildlife Conservation Enactment 1997 and a license is required from the director of the Wildlife Department to hunt or collect wild specimens (6). ,pet; ,cites;protected; ,1,2
yellow pond turtle,Mauremys mutica,Asian yellow pond turtle (Mauremys mutica),Animalia,Chordata,Reptilia,Testudines,Geoemydidae,Mauremys (1),Carapace length: up to 20 cm (2),The majority of Asia\xe2\x80\x99s freshwater turtles are threatened with extinction (7) (8) and the Asian yellow pond turtle is no exception (1). This \xe2\x80\x98Asian Turtle Crisis\xe2\x80\x99 is mainly attributable to largely uncontrolled trade for food traditional medicine and pets (7) (9) (10) driven primarily by increased demand in China (7) (11).,The Asian turtle trade was largely unregulated prior to 2002. However since then several species of Asian turtle have been listed under the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) (9). The Asian yellow pond turtle is listed on CITES Appendix II which requires export permits for international trade (3). Unfortunately enforcement appears limited and globally threatened species of turtle remain in trade in China (9). ,pet;pollution; ,cites;captive breeding; ,2,2
Asian wild ass; khulan; khur; kulan; onager,Equus hemionus,Asiatic wild ass (Equus hemionus),Animalia,Chordata,Mammalia,Perissodactyla,Equidae,Equus (1),200 - 260 kg (2),The greatest threat facing the Asiatic wild ass is poaching for meat and hides and in some areas for use in traditional medicine (5) (7). The extreme isolation of many of the subpopulations is in itself a threat as genetic problems can result from inbreeding (7). Overgrazing by livestock reduces food availability and herders also reduce the availability of water at springs. The cutting down of nutritious shrubs and bushes exacerbates the problem. Furthermore a series of drought years could have devastating effects on this beleaguered species (6). Habitat fragmentation is a particular concern in Mongolia as result of the increasingly dense network of roads railway lines and fences required to support mining activities (1) (5).,The Asiatic wild ass does occur in a number of protected sites where targeted conservation action has been taken. Domestic animals have been removed from some protected areas and artificial watering holes have been made. Hay is provided for the species and there are hefty fines for poaching. Moreover the species is legally protected in many of the countries in which it occurs (6). The priority for future conservation measures is: to ensure the protection of this species in particularly vulnerable parts of its range; to encourage the involvement of local people in the conservation of the Asiatic wild ass; and to conduct further research into the behaviour ecology and taxonomy of the species (1). Fortunately several Asiatic wild ass research programmes considering these issues are already underway (5) (6). ,fragmentation;poaching; ,protected; ,2,1

Its popularity has led to severe exploitation in several areas particularly the North Atlantic Ocean (2). Despite catch quotas being in place limits are often not respected and catches are frequently under-reported (5). Unless adequate management measures are quickly implemented and most importantly enforced the collapse of some Atlantic bluefin tuna stocks is a real possibility (5). It is thought that the Critically Endangered western Atlantic stock may have already collapsed the result of overfishing and poor management. This stock is now in grave danger of extinction (6).,In 1966 the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (ICCAT) was formed taking responsibility for the conservation of tunas in the Atlantic Ocean and its adjacent seas (5). Since 1998 catch limits have been in place for the Atlantic bluefin tuna in the eastern Atlantic and Mediterranean but until 2006 it was believed that these limits were not respected and were largely ineffective (5). In 2006 ICCAT adopted a 15 year recovery plan for the highly threatened stocks of the eastern Atlantic and Mediterranean. The plan includes stricter catch limits and more extensive closures of fisheries in certain areas and at certain times (5). ,fishing;overfishing; , ,2,0
Animalia,Hippoglossus hippoglossus,Atlantic halibut (Hippoglossus hippoglossus),Animalia,Chordata,Actinopterygii,Pleuronectiformes,Pleuronectidae,Hippoglossus (1),up to 315 kg (2),The Atlantic halibut has suffered massive declines throughout its range over the last two centuries including virtual elimination in many areas as a result of over-fishing (7). Their slow growth rate and late onset of sexual maturity make these fish extremely vulnerable to the effects of over-fishing (5). Not only does this mean that individuals are often harvested many years before reaching maturity and therefore unable to increase abundance through reproduction but also that populations will be slow to recover from collapses in numbers (7). Since population numbers are now too low to sustain target fisheries Atlantic halibut are predominantly taken as <strong>bycatch</strong> by bottom trawlers and longliners (8). Surveys indicate that these fish have continued to decline in the North Atlantic over the past two decades despite being taken only incidentally as <strong>bycatch</strong> with little targeted halibut fishing (7).,There is currently no management plan in place for this fish and it is therefore thought probable that numbers of Atlantic halibut will continue to decline. It has been argued that Atlantic halibut are unlikely to recover simply by banning halibut landings or designating protected areas. Rather the recovery and survival of this Endangered flatfish species will depend on reducing its <strong>bycatch</strong> in other highly exploited fisheries (7). ,fishing; ,protected; ,1,1
hooded petrel; Schlegel's petrel,Pterodroma incerta,Atlantic petrel (Pterodroma incerta),Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Procellariiformes,Procellariidae,Pterodroma (1),c. 520 g (3),Although still common the Atlantic petrel qualifies as Endangered because it has a very small breeding range with the vast majority of the population on just one island (2). Such a limited range places the bird at risk from chance events such as natural disasters or the introduction of mammalian predators (2) (6). On Gough predation by the introduced house mouse (<i>Mus musculus</i>) is having a severe effect on the Atlantic petrel\xe2\x80\x99s breeding success with just two percent of the chicks reaching fledging in 2007 (2). The large population of native southern skua (<i>Catharacta antarctica</i>) are also known to feed on seabirds including the Atlantic petrel (2).,Gough Island is both a Nature Reserve and World Heritage Site and while this provides good protection from human disturbance it does not offer the Gough bunting any protection from the mouse predation that is driving it towards extinction (2). A study of the mice conducted by The Royal Society for the Protection of Birds (RSPB) and funded by the UK government's Overseas Territories Environment Programme has shown that their eradication from the island is feasible. Unfortunately however until adequate funding is acquired this will not occur (7). Gough Island is widely recognised as having one of the most diverse bird colonies in the world including four endangered species and every effort should therefore be made to protect it and the rich biodiversity it hosts (8). ,hunting;pet; , ,2,0
Animalia,Thalassarche chlororhynchos,Atlantic yellow-nosed albatross (Thalassarche chlororhynchos),Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Procellariiformes,Diomedeidae,Thalassarche (1),2.2 kg (3),As a scavenger of fishing vessel bait the Atlantic yellow-nosed albatross is suffering population declines as a result of longline fishing. Longlining is mainly used to catch tuna and swordfish by releasing a line of baited hooks that sink to the appropriate depth for these fish. Many seabirds dive for the bait before it has sunk becoming caught on the hooks and drowning as the line reaches its final depth. The Atlantic yellow-nosed albatross attends trawlers off the coast of south-eastern Brazil and the west coast of southern Africa (2). It also suffers losses as a result of collisions with cables on trawl vessels (6).,The Atlantic yellow-nosed albatross is monitored on Gough Island which is both a nature reserve and a World Heritage Site. A population census was carried out in 2000/2001 and was repeated in 2004. Remote tracking has also been used in order to determine the distribution of these birds at sea. The information obtained will be used to assess the overlap between the birds and longline fishing operations. Longline fishing is controversial and techniques to reduce the seabird catch have been suggested such as weighting lines to sink them more rapidly and setting them at night (2). A Threat Abatement Plan has been put into action by the Australian government which proposes to promote public awareness of the conservation needs of albatrosses and to reduce the <strong>by-catch</strong> of this species and other albatross species (6). ,loss;fishing; , ,2,0

The IUCN who assessed the conservation status of this lizard also state the possible development of hydroelectric projects and mining as a future threat to this species (1).  The low reproductive potential of Aurelio\xe2\x80\x99s rock lizard and its restricted distribution only act to enhance the devastating effects that such threats may have on the population (3).,Aurelio\xe2\x80\x99s rock lizard is listed on Appendix III of the Bern Convention a convention which aims to conserve wild flora and fauna and their natural habitats and to promote European co-operation in that field (4).  Wild animal species on Appendix III are protected but can be exploited if regulated in accordance with the convention (4).  It is yet to be seen whether this level of protection is sufficient to ensure the survival of this Endangered reptile. , ,protected; ,0,1

In 2007 a Bittern Project was set up which aims to study the Australasian bittern and its habitats raise awareness and educate the local community in an attempt to limit habitat destruction (7) (8).

Since European settlement an estimated 50 percent of Australian wetlands have been modified for human land use. Drainage and diversion of the water in these wetlands have rendered them unsuitable for the Australian painted snipe and constitute the primary threat to this species (3) (6).,As little is known about the Australian painted snipe conservation efforts have focused on improving knowledge of the species through assessing its habitat preferences developing a database of records and conducting annual surveys.

In particular laurel forest has been cut for grazing and agriculture and lost due to <strong>afforestation</strong> by Japanese red cedar (<i>Cryptomeria japonica</i>) (3). Food shortages are now a cause for concern throughout the year but most severe in late winter. The species has been left with an extremely small population and restricted range on just one island. The resulting reduced genetic variation may make it vulnerable to random environmental changes and inbreeding may reduce reproductive output (2). In addition predation by feral cats and rats is a potential problem although their impact is currently unknown (2) (3).,The Azores bullfinch is protected under Portuguese law and the area in which it is found in Pico da Vara has been designated a Natural Forest Reserve by the Regional Government of the Azores (2) (4).

The low reproductive rate of this species means that populations are particularly vulnerable to disturbance such as habitat loss and hunting (5). Vast tracts of rainforest are being cleared to make way for cattle ranching and developments; almost all of the forest in El Salvador has been lost and there is no recent information to suggest that Baird's tapir persists in this country (5).,Baird's tapir the national symbol of Belize is protected in the majority of Central American countries although hunting laws are often poorly enforced (5). Populations are unable to withstand mass logging practices but have been known to survive and even prosper in areas where selective logging occurs which could be an important factor in their conservation (5). The IUCN/SSC Tapir Specialist Group has published a Species Action Plan identifying key actions required to protect this species; including species status surveys and the protection of habitat (5).

Ghana and Liberia both have a higher percentage of their natural forests remaining but even in these countries populations of baku have experienced significant declines and the extinction of this important species is a possibility (2).  Illegal and poorly controlled logging pose the greatest threat to the baku\xe2\x80\x99s continued existence (2) but it has also been reported that the reduction of forest elephant numbers in certain areas may limit the natural regeneration of baku (2) (8).,Baku trees are protected by law in C\xc3\xb4te d'Ivoire and due to the problem of overexploitation of timbers Ghana and Liberia have imposed bans on the exporting of baku in log form (8) (9).

Although these factors have caused a dramatic decline in numbers of the banded hare-wallaby causing their extinction on the mainland those that remain on the uninhabited islands of Dorre and Bernier thankfully remain relatively secure (6).,Unfortunately attempts made to reintroduce this species to Dirk Hartog Island in the 1970s and to Peron Peninsula at Shark Bay in 2001 failed. Cat predation played an important part in these failures as well as intensive browsing by sheep and goats and a period of drought over the summer of 1979/80 on Dirk Hartog resulting in the loss of 30 to 40 percent of the <i>Acacia </i>shrub cover. Captive populations are currently held at the Peron Captive Breeding Facility and the Dryandra Captive Breeding Facility though the latter has experienced problems with aerial predation by the wedge-tailed eagle (8). At last in 2003 and 2004 banded hare-wallabies from Peron Captive Breeding Facility and the Shark Bay Islands were successfully reintroduced to Faure Island after the removal of goats from the island (8) (9). This population is now thriving and represents a remarkable victory for conservation. Banded hare-wallabies have been so successful in adapting to their new environment that they bred in the first year after release providing fresh hope for the long-term survival of this relic species of \xe2\x80\x98short faced kangaroo\xe2\x80\x99 (9). ,pet; ,captive breeding; ,1,1

Animalia,Pterapogon kauderni,Banggai cardinalfish (Pterapogon kauderni),Animalia,Chordata,Actinopterygii,Perciformes,Apogonidae,Pterapogon (1),Length: Up to 80 mm (1),The major threat to the Banggai cardinalfish is overexploitation for the aquarium trade (10) (11). There are currently three main collection centres in the Banggai Archipelago where as many as 100000 individuals may be caught monthly from around the islands before being shipped to Bali and North Sulawesi to be sold to international exporters. During shipping which may take between 24 hours and 5 days up to 30 percent of the fish may die with similar quantities frequently being rejected due to poor condition. A study of the Banggai cardinalfish fishery revealed that during 2007 at least 1000000 individuals were caught which given that the fish\xe2\x80\x99s total population in this year was estimated to be 2200000 individuals is a serious cause for concern. Indeed the increasing levels of exploitation have led to the extermination of two local populations while the global population of the Banggai cardinalfish is believed to have been reduced to about 10 percent of its historical abundance and range (11).,A successful captive-breeding program has been developed by the New Jersey Academy for Aquatic Sciences. However the aquarium trade has not yet made any significant efforts to replace wild-caught fish with captive-bred fish (1). ,fishing;disease; ,cites;protected; ,2,2
Cormoran des bancs,Phalacrocorax neglectus,Bank cormorant (Phalacrocorax neglectus),Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Pelecaniformes,Phalacrocoracidae,Phalacrocorax (1),1.8 kg (2),Between 1978 and 1997 the number of breeding pairs of bank cormorant decreased by around 50% (6). The greatest declines occurred at the breeding colonies on Mercury and Ichaboe Islands in Namibia (6). It is thought that severe food shortages may be the primary reason for these severe losses (6). One of the bank cormorant\xe2\x80\x99s main food sources the pelagic goby is not targeted by the commercial fishery but following a severe <strong>Benguela Ni\xc3\xb1o</strong> event in 1994 stocks in central Namibia collapsed and have not sufficiently recovered since (8).,Whilst the threatened bank cormorant is not listed on the Convention of Migratory Species (CMS) it is part of the African-Eurasian Waterbird Agreement (AEWA) set up under the auspices of the CMS. Parties to AEWA are required to undertake a wide range of conservation actions described in a detailed Action Plan to protect waterbirds that cross international borders. Conservation actions include habitat conservation management of human activities research monitoring and education (9). ,loss;pet;pollution; ,captive breeding;protected; ,3,2
Touraco de Bannerman; Touraco dorÃ©,Tauraco bannermani,Bannermanâs turaco (Tauraco bannermani),Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Cuculiformes,Musophagidae,Tauraco (1),200 â 250 g (2),Bannerman\xe2\x80\x99s turaco is severely threatened by habitat destruction with the Kilum-Ijim forest having halved in size between 1963 and 1986 (5) and the remaining forest still being cleared or modified (2). Forest fires are a major cause of habitat loss as well as forest clearance for agriculture grazing firewood and timber. Since this species seems reluctant to cross open habitats the small pockets of birds that remain in forest fragments are in imminent danger of extinction (5). As a result Bannerman\xe2\x80\x99s turaco is only thought likely to survive if the c.100 square km of forest on Mount Oku (Kilum-Ijim forest) is preserved (2).,With the support of the BirdLife International Kilum-Ijim Forest Project local communities are now actively involved in conserving montane forest (2) (5). The condition of the forest and its endemic birds are monitored as well as the overall extent of forest cover in the Bamenda Highlands. In 2000 community-based conservation activities were also extended to other forest fragments in the Bamenda Highlands (5). Alternatives to forest clearance have been offered to farmers such as bee-keeping with the honey produced fetching a good price at local markets and plentiful honey requiring a healthy forest (2). ,loss; , ,1,0
Tembadau,Bos javanicus,Banteng (Bos javanicus),Animalia,Chordata,Mammalia,Cetartiodactyla,Bovidae,Bos (1),600 - 800 kg (2),The most significant threats facing banteng are hunting and habitat degradation and loss (1). Extinction is thought imminent in Vietnam and in Cambodia and Lao PDR habitat fragmentation caused by agriculture and new settlements is seriously threatening the remaining mainland Asian populations (3). These wild cattle have been domesticated in numerous locations most notably on the island of Bali with over 1.5 million domestic banteng thought to exist (2). Interbreeding with domestic and feral cattle threatens to contaminate the gene pool by hybridization of the remaining wild banteng and disease transmission from domestic livestock is also considered a serious danger (1) (6). The number of banteng trophies reported for sale within Cambodia and the Lao PDR along the Thai/Cambodia Thai/Lao and Thai/Myanmar borders strongly suggests that the banteng population on the mainland has been and remains under considerable pressure from hunters (2) (3). Despite legal prohibitions against trade in banteng law enforcement is inadequate and poaching and illegal trade in their meat and horns remains widespread (6) (7).,The banteng is legally protected across its range and occurs in a number of protected areas (1). However the natural resources of reserves often continue to be exploited with about 12 banteng poached annually for example in Baluran National Park Java (7). Several on-going field survey programmes exist (e.g. in Indochina) and a monitoring programme is conducted in East Java. A large captive population is maintained world-wide (1) with European zoos first importing captive banteng from collections in Indonesia as early as 1867 (4). Such populations provide a buffer against total extinction offer potential for future reintroductions into the wild and can be managed to maintain the genetic diversity of the species. In addition they now have a new and exciting role that utilises the very cutting edge of technology and scientific knowledge \xe2\x80\x93 cloning! For the first time on April 1st 2003 a healthy clone of this endangered species was born offering powerful evidence that cloning technology can play a role in preserving and even reconstituting threatened and endangered species (8). ,loss;fragmentation;hunting;poaching;disease; ,protected; ,5,1

PÃ©trel de Barau,Pterodroma baraui,Barauâs petrel (Pterodroma baraui),Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Procellariiformes,Procellariidae,Pterodroma (1),Length: 38 cm (2),Mammals introduced to the island of R\xc3\xa9union are believed to be impacting the Baraus\xe2\x80\x99 petrel; eggs and chicks are preyed on by rats and cats and goats may trample burrows and disturb suitable nesting habitat (2) (5). However the extent to which this threatens the species is not clear; the remote rugged habitat of breeding colonies may have limited access for these alien species (3). In the last 50 or so years urban development on the island has led to a dramatic increase in the number and intensity of streetlights and other bright lights which confuse large numbers of fledging Barau\xe2\x80\x99s petrels on their way to the sea at night. Grounded birds are then usually killed by vehicles or predated by dogs and cats. An additional potential threat comes from the increasing pressure for tourism to remote areas which could result in human disturbance at the nesting colonies (5).,A campaign was implemented to raise public awareness of the effect of urban lighting on petrels and to rescue as many grounded birds as possible. Each year many Barau\xe2\x80\x99s petrels are now found and rescued with increasing success; in 2001 787 petrels were rescued (2) (5). There are also proposals to reduce light pollution on the island (2). Increasing tourism suggests that conservation efforts should include strict regulation of human activities near the colonies particularly hiking and mountaineering. Efforts should also be made to eradicate potential predators from the nesting colonies (5). ,pet; , ,1,0

In Algeria forest fires and livestock grazing are additional problems and some young animals are captured as pets. In Morocco the problems of logging and overgrazing are exacerbated by drought. Moroccan forestry authorities have considered culling macaques because of their bark stripping. They were once found throughout North Africa but now only exist in small areas (9).,Seen as a symbol of Gibraltar and valued as a tourist attraction these macaques are protected to some extent (4). In Algeria this species is protected in several national parks but there are few active conservation policies elsewhere. There have been proposals to <strong>re-introduce</strong> them to the Kouf National Park in Libya and also to <strong>re-introduce</strong> them to Tunisia (9). The World Conservation Union recommends further population studies of the Barbary macaque and also the investigation of the bark-stripping problem in Morocco. National park protection must also be implemented more effectively (9). ,loss;hunting;pet; ,protected; ,3,1
Animalia,Cephalopterus glabricollis,Bare-necked umbrellabird (Cephalopterus glabricollis),Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Cotingidae,Cephalopterus (1),Length: 36 - 41 cm (2) (3)Male weight: ca. 450 g (2)Female weight: ca. 320 g (2),The bare-necked umbrellabird appears to be relatively uncommon throughout its range with a small and declining global population. Although it occurs in adequately protected highland forests much of the species\xe2\x80\x99 lowland habitat is unprotected and is under continued threat from deforestation and conversion to plantations and cattle ranches (2) (3) (5) (6) (7). A lack of suitable habitat corridors between lowland and highland areas may also be a problem (5) and recent highway construction is further removing the species\xe2\x80\x99 habitat and opening the region up to increased settlement and land clearance (3) (5). In addition to these threats global climate change could potentially shift the bare-necked umbrellabird\xe2\x80\x99s range up to higher elevations eventually leaving the species with nowhere else to go (6).,The bare-necked umbrellabird breeds in several protected areas including La Amistad International Park and Monteverde Cloud Forest Reserve in Costa Rica (3) (5). The adjacent lowlands where these birds spend the non-breeding season are less well protected (3) (7) but lowland protected areas used by the bare-necked umbrellabird include San San-Pond Sak a Ramsar site in Panama (2) (9) and La Selva Biological Station in Costa Rica (3). Further conservation actions recommended for the bare-necked umbrellabird include population monitoring the preservation and promotion of forest corridors and the establishment and expansion of protected areas especially in lowland areas (2) (3) (5) (7). Protecting the habitats of this distinctive bird would also help to preserve many other species that depend on these forests for survival (7). , ,protected; ,0,1

Agricultural development in the form of stream channelisation and water extraction for crops is destroying the shallow and fast-flowing habitat required by this species for feeding and breeding (3). Unsustainable water extraction has caused the river to completely dry up in some areas (1).,More research needs to be undertaken on the biology of this species in particular relationships with alien predators and competitors in order to better understand how best to conserve it (3). In addition due to the specific habitat requirements of Banard\xe2\x80\x99s rock catfish special care must be taken in conservation strategies to maintain its preferred habitat of clean fast-flowing water (3). The conservation of this species is linked with the overall management of the Olifants River system and conservation of all three <strong>endemic</strong> <em>Austroglanis</em>species is of great importance in order to maintain the functioning of the small <strong>endemic</strong> river community (3). ,invasive; ,captive breeding; ,1,1
barn-door skate; barndoor winter skate; barn-door winter skate,Dipturus laevis,Barndoor skate (Dipturus laevis),Animalia,Chordata,Chondrichthyes,Rajiformes,Rajidae,Dipturus (1),up to 20 kg (1) (2),Although not specifically targeted by fisheries the barndoor skate has often been taken as <strong>bycatch</strong> in commercial trawl nets and as part of a complex of several skate species fished in USA waters. There is also a directed fishery for dogfish and skates on the Georges Bank which is thought to have led to a decline in this species. The flesh of this and other skates is used as lobster bait fish meal and pet food and the meat from its \xe2\x80\x98wings\xe2\x80\x99 (the <strong>pectoral fins</strong>) is sold as seafood (1) (2) (3) (4).,Since it was reported to be near to extinction in 1998 (7) the status of the barndoor skate has been the subject of much debate and a number of petitions have been made to list the species under the US Endangered Species Act (1) (2). The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) listed the barndoor skate as a \xe2\x80\x98Species of Concern\xe2\x80\x99 (4) but it was removed from the list in early 2010 after it was decided that there was no evidence the species was in imminent danger of extinction (8). There has been a ban on possession of the species in US waters (3) (4) and most significantly no-take zones in areas such as Georges Bank appear to have led to decreased mortality (9) and an increase in the number of juveniles (1) (2) (3) suggesting that areas protected from trawling would be effective in allowing the barndoor skate population to recover (1) (2) (7). This large skate may also benefit from further research to better understand its conservation status and the threats it faces. ,fishing;overfishing;pet; ,protected;endangered species act; ,3,2

Animalia,Fundulus julisia,Barrenâs topminnow (Fundulus julisia),Animalia,Chordata,Actinopterygii,Cyprinodontiformes,Cyprinodontidae,Fundulus (1),Length: up to 7 cm (2),With an extremely limited distribution and an accordingly small population the Barren\xe2\x80\x99s topminnow is particularly vulnerable to extinction from both natural and artificial causes (3). In 1998 a drought at the pool where this species was discovered required the removal of the entire local population. The fish were housed in an artificial facility and re-released after heavy rains replenished the water (5). Along with natural incidents habitat degradation and development are also significantly affecting this species (3) (5). Perhaps the most severe threat to this species however is the introduced non-native western mosquitofish <i>Gambusia affinis</i> (6) (7). Artificially introduced to control mosquitoes by preying on the aquatic larvae this species has becomes widespread and has invaded the range of the Barren\xe2\x80\x99s topminnow (7). The invasive species preys on the larval and juvenile stages of Barren\xe2\x80\x99s topminnow resulting in catastrophic local population declines (6) (8).,Though considered endangered by the state of Tennessee the Barren\xe2\x80\x99s topminnow does not currently receive Federal protection (3) (5). Fortunately however concerted efforts are being made to conserve this imperilled species. In 2001 the Barren\xe2\x80\x99s topminnow Working Group was established which has been responsible for implementing programmes to restock the Barren\xe2\x80\x99s topminnow at over 24 sites throughout much of its historic range. While many restocking efforts appear to have proven successful with successful wild breeding occurring the presence of mosquitofish remains problematic (4). The group is therefore researching and implementing ways to minimise the impacts of the invasive species including the creation of barriers around one pool occupied by this species to prevent the mosquitofish from entering (4) (5). The group is also undertaking studies to determine the effects of habitat loss and degradation (4). In order to address this threat it is clear that land management practices encouraging the formation of open water habitats favoured by this species are necessary (3). ,invasive; , ,1,0

Logging of marri first for woodchips and now for use in flooring and furniture has dramatically reduced the availability of food and nesting trees. Additionally many nest hollows have been found to be occupied by <strong>feral</strong> bees which not only limit the bird\xe2\x80\x99s nest availability but are also known to have caused the loss of chicks and killed a brooding female. Competition for nests from maned geese (<i>Chenonetta jubatta</i>) and Australian shelduck (<i>Tadorna tadornoides</i>) may also be a factor as duck numbers increase in the south-west (9) (12).,Baudin\xe2\x80\x99s black cockatoo is listed under Appendix II of CITES limiting international trade in the species (3) and it is illegal to take these birds from the wild with a penalty of up to a maximum of $10000 for such an offence (12) (13). This cockatoo is given special protection under <i>Western Australia\xe2\x80\x99s Wildlife Conservation Act 1950</i> (4) and has been protected under Australian law since 1996 (9). Forest management has now changed so that woodchipping practices ceased in 2003 (9) (10). However the bird still clings to a precarious existence and further conservation measures are desperately required to safeguard its future including: making all shooting by commercial orchard farmers illegal; developing non-lethal methods of damage control; developing and implementing a feral bee control strategy; and protecting mature marri trees relied upon so heavily as nest and food sources by this rare <strong>endemic</strong> bird (9).

The conversion of forest to agricultural land using <strong>slash-and-burn</strong> techniques is commonplace around the Tsingy de Bemaraha National Park and in some places the forest has been reduced to just a few metres width. The southern border of the national park is also under pressure from annual bushfires which limit the forest\xe2\x80\x99s regenerative potential. As this lemur is confined to this area there is increasing concern about the status of this little known species (6). A population around the village of Ankinajao is already believed to have become extinct due to excessive logging and its total range is now probably no more than 5000 square kilometres (1) (6).,The improvement of legal enforcement within the Tsingy de Bemaraha National Park should give this species a degree of sanctuary from some threats such as hunting and will potentially secure the species\xe2\x80\x99 habitat. As there is still a dearth of data regarding the ecology and distribution of this little known yet curious species further efforts are required to prevent additional declines (1).\xa0 ,loss; , ,1,0
Plantae,Agrostis trachychlaena,Bentgrass (Agrostis trachychlaena),Plantae,Tracheophyta,Liliopsida,Cyperales,Gramineae,Agrostis (1),Stem length: 20 to 55 cm (2),The population of <i>Agrostis trachychlaena</i> is though to number fewer than 250 mature individuals. The species has only been found once on Inaccessible Island and on Nightingale Island the dense cover of <i>Spartina arundinaccea</i> makes it difficult to accurately estimate the population size. It is thought that <i>Agrostis trachychlaena</i> occupies a total area of less than ten square kilometres and together with its small population this makes it particularly vulnerable to extinction (1). Although thought to be naturally scarce possibly because of natural erosion of the volcanic islands and the subsequent loss of habitat potential man-made threats include the introduction of non-native plant species and fire (1). In particular introduced New Zealand flax (<i>Phormium tenax</i>) has the potential to exclude native plant species and increasing tourism on the islands means an increasing potential for future introductions of alien species (3). Non-native <strong>invertebrates</strong> including earthworms slugs and woodlice have also been introduced to Inaccessible Island with unknown effects on its ecology (3).,Both Inaccessible and Nightingale Islands are subject to management plans and Inaccessible Island was declared a Nature Reserve in 1997 (1) (3). Fieldworkers from the Tristan da Cunha Darwin Initiative Project have already undertaken measures to remove invasive New Zealand flax from the islands although frequent follow-up visits are likely to be needed to ensure the islands remain free of this and other alien plants. It will also be important to inform visitors about the risk of accidentally introducing exotic species and to take necessary precautions to prevent introductions (3) (4).

The species is also sold by pet traders and sadly its increasing scarcity in the wild is only likely to lead to a greater demand for the species and higher market value encouraging further collection from the wild. Furthermore since the reproductive rate is thought to be very low populations of this species are believed to be very sensitive to removal of individuals and are slow to recover (8).,The big-headed turtle is legally protected in parts of its range and is likely to occur in protected areas (8). However extensive and significant illegal international trade apparently continues. Captive breeding cannot supply demand but does occur on an extremely limited scale in Thailand and reportedly also occurs for commercial sale on Chinese turtle farms (8). ,pet; ,captive breeding;protected; ,1,2

Golden-rumped lion tamarin,Leontopithecus chrysopygus,Black lion tamarin (Leontopithecus chrysopygus),Animalia,Chordata,Mammalia,Primates,Callitrichidae,Leontopithecus (1),540 â 690 g (2),Over 90 percent of the Atlantic forest in Brazil has been lost to logging development and cultivation. The species is also vulnerable to fire and hunting (4). Areas of prime habitat occur in and around the Morro do Diabo State Park; however five percent of this area was flooded in the early 1980's following the construction of a hydroelectric plant (7). The remaining black lion tamarin populations have been isolated for some time and studies have shown that genetic diversity is extremely low as a result of inbreeding (7). <strong>Inbreeding depression</strong> which can reduce the fitness of the population in terms of survival reproductive capacity and growth is therefore a cause for concern in this species.,A long-term programme of conservation and environmental education targeting the black lion tamarin is underway (7). An important measure to combat the effects of inbreeding will be to allow movement of individuals between the isolated sub-populations. This can occur through <strong>translocations</strong> of individuals or by creating corridors between habitat patches to facilitate movement between populations (4). Corridors have already been planted and some translocations have occurred (7). There is currently a captive population of around 100 individuals which require the occasional incorporation of wild individuals to maintain genetic variation (7). ,hunting; , ,1,0

It is hoped that its overall declining trend has reversed recently partly due to a change in agricultural practices that has seen more insects and worms being revealed by ploughing. The black-billed gull has developed a habit of following ploughs and aiding farmers by picking out insect pests. However the breeding habitat of the bird continues to decline in size. This reduction in habitat is the cause of the drop in gull numbers over the last 30 years as land is increasingly turned over to agriculture. Additionally breeding habitat is currently threatened by the spread of exotic lupins which clog the waterways (2) (5).,The New Zealand Government has launched the New Zealand Biodiversity Strategy to respond to its obligations under the Convention on Biological Diversity. This includes management of wetland habitats by protecting them from development as well as by planting appropriate plant species in areas recovering from disturbance in order to stabilise the soil and reduce fertiliser run-off that can encourage the growth of exotic species such as lupins at the expense of native species. The water level must be maintained and a water care code has been established to ensure that users of wetland habitats are able to act responsibly (6). , , ,0,0
black-breasted hill turtle; Chinese leaf turtle; Indo-Chinese serrated turtle; scalloped leaf turtle; Spengler's turtle; Vietnamese leaf turtle; Vietnamese wood turtle,Geoemyda spengleri,Black-breasted leaf turtle (Geoemyda spengleri),Animalia,Chordata,Reptilia,Testudines,Bataguridae,Geoemyda (1),Carapace length: up to 11.5 cm (2),Like most Asian turtle species the black-breasted leaf turtle is in grave danger of extinction due to over-collection from the wild for the food medicine and pet trade. Turtles are highly prized for food and traditional \xe2\x80\x98medicinal\xe2\x80\x99 purposes and are ubiquitous in Asian food markets (9). Importation to the U.S. for the pet trade began in the 1980s and most specimens found in pet stores today are still freshly imported from Asia (6) although there is now substantial breeding of the species in China and some of the young exported into the global pet trade may come from farms (2). Nevertheless before reaching their destination many of these turtles have had to endure poor conditions in food markets and are malnourished or develop pneumonia mouth sores or other illnesses and almost all will have parasites from which many die (6). Another important factor in this species\xe2\x80\x99 decline is forest loss and degradation from clearance for agriculture and uncontrolled wildfires (2). Thus the high mortality rate amongst wild-caught leaf turtles combined with unsustainable rates of harvesting from the wild limited use of captive breeding and farming and ongoing habitat loss has led to a serious decline in population numbers and left this enigmatic turtle clinging to a precarious existence (9).,Substantial advances are being made in management and captive breeding of this turtle particularly in central Europe and the U.S. and captive breeding meets most of the serious hobbyist demand. However it remains cheaper to import animals for a few dollars/euros than to obtain captive-bred animals so the cheap pet imports continue and continue to be bought by impulse buyers (2). This pet market combined with habitat loss and the ongoing demand for turtles in the Asian food markets mean the outlook for the black-breasted leaf turtle and most Asian turtle species remains grim (9). ,loss;pet; ,captive breeding; ,2,1
Animalia,Thalassarche melanophrys,Black-browed albatross (Thalassarche melanophrys),Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Procellariiformes,Diomedeidae,Thalassarche (1),Length: 80 - 95 cm (2)Wingspan: 200 - 235 cm (2),The greatest threat to this species is thought to be the increase in <strong>by-catch</strong> as a result of long-line sea fishing in the southern oceans especially along the Patagonian shelf off the east coast of Argentina and Uruguay (5). An estimated 60 percent of the total breeding population of around 530 000 individuals breed on the Falkland Islands and another 20 percent on South Georgia (5). The Falklands population has declined by almost a third during the last two decades most of this within a period of five years to 2001 (5). Much of this decline is blamed on an increase in long-line fishing in the surrounding seas but the black-browed albatross is at risk from this practice throughout its range. It is one of the most frequent victims of both long-line and trawler fishing in the southern hemisphere (5).,As a result of fears over its declining population the IUCN has upgraded the status of the black-browed albatross to \xe2\x80\x98Endangered\xe2\x80\x99 (1). On the basis of the losses at the birds\xe2\x80\x99 chief breeding sites it is calculated that it will have declined by around 65 percent during the next 65 years and by more than 50 percent throughout the rest of its range over the same period (5). ,fishing; , ,1,0
Chanwan LasÃ©l; DiablotÃ­n,Pterodroma hasitata,Black-capped petrel (Pterodroma hasitata),Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Procellariiformes,Procellariidae,Pterodroma (1),Length: 40 cm (2)Wingspan: 96 cm (3),Up until the latter half of the 19th century the black-capped petrel was relatively common within its breeding range (3) (10). Around this time a burgeoning human population in the Caribbean islands and consequential habitat loss harvesting for food and predation by introduced mammals saw petrel numbers crash almost to the point of extinction. Indeed for several decades prior to the early 1960s the species appeared to have vanished completely. Fortunately in 1963 an estimated 2000 breeding pairs were discovered at the existing colonies in Haiti (7). It soon became evident however that these populations were under the same pressures that extirpated the breeding populations on other islands. By the turn of this century the estimated number of breeding pairs had declined to 1000 with a total population size of approximately 5000 birds (3). Despite increased awareness the population in Haiti is likely to continue to decline as a result of continued conversion of broadleaf forest to cropland and pasture at Parc La Visite. Sadly this downward population trend on the breeding grounds may be further exacerbated by proposals to develop oil and gas fields within petrel foraging grounds off the coast of the USA (2) (15).,Most of the known black-capped petrel breeding populations occur within La Visite National Park and Pic Macaya National Park in Haiti while Sierra de Baoruco National Park in the Dominican Republic also contains small populations (7) (8) (9) (10). However despite official park status the implementation of a sustainable conservation plan in Haiti\xe2\x80\x99s two national parks has no measurable conservation effect due to political instability corruption absence of political will and the abject poverty of the local population who depend critically on the forest for their day-to-day survival. Given that almost the world\xe2\x80\x99s entire black-capped petrel breeding population occurs within these two parks ensuring their protection presents the most critical challenge to conservation efforts (16). Current proposals for Haiti\xe2\x80\x99s National Parks include establishing core ecological reserves that are strictly off-limits to humans maintenance of defined park boundaries and long-term monitoring and research of avian populations (17) (18). However with Haiti\xe2\x80\x99s breeding populations still under threat the presence of alternative nesting sites may be crucial to the species\xe2\x80\x99 survival. ,loss;pet; , ,2,0

Manorina flavigula melanotis,Manorina melanotis,Black-eared miner (Manorina melanotis),Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Meliphagidae,Manorina (1),Length: 23 - 26 cm (2),The major cause of the black-eared miner decline is habitat loss and fragmentation. Much of the eucalypt mallee in its former range was cleared for agriculture in the early 20th century by European settlers (2). This habitat alteration has led to the closely related yellow-throated miner (<em>Manorina flavigula</em>) which favours disturbed and cleared habitatscolonising areas within the black-eared miner\xe2\x80\x99s range and contact between the two species has led to <strong>hybridisation</strong>. Interbreeding between the two species is currently the greatest threat to the black-eared miner and there are now thought to be very few \xe2\x80\x98pure\xe2\x80\x99 black-eared miner colonies left (2) (4).,Although currently classified as Endangered the black-eared miner has actually improved in conservations status since 1994 when it was classified as Critically Endangered.

Animalia,Platalea minor,Black-faced spoonbill (Platalea minor),Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Ciconiiformes,Threskiornithidae,Platalea (1),Length: 76 cm (2),Habitat destruction in the form of the alteration and drainage of wetlands for aquaculture and industrial development is probably the biggest threat to the survival of the black-faced spoonbill (6). The small number of wintering sites means that the species is very vulnerable to any chance event that may occur particularly to the potentially catastrophic effects of pollution (6).,The black-faced spoonbill is protected in China Taiwan North Korea South Korea and Japan and a number of both breeding and wintering sites are protected as sanctuaries (2). An Action Plan for the species was produced in 1995 following an international workshop; the Wild Bird Society of Japan acts as the secretariat of the Black-faced Spoonbill Conservation Network (6). Educational and research programmes have been undertaken in a number of countries and an international census has been established and run by Hong Kong Bird Watching Society (4). ,pollution; ,protected; ,1,1

Prairies have been modified for intensive agriculture and there is now less than two percent of the original ferret habitat left (3). The ferret's main prey prairie dogs were systematically poisoned in vast tracts of their habitat by a government eradication programme in the mid 1900s (5). Prairie dog burrows were thought to damage cropland and ferret numbers fell in direct proportion with the dramatic decline of their prey (3). The final threat to black-footed ferret numbers and perhaps the most pertinent today is disease particularly canine distemper and plague (3). Plague introduced to North America causes even greater devastation in populations of prairie dogs and ferrets than it caused in human populations of Europe and Asia (8).,The black-footed ferret was thought to be extinct in the 1970s until a last population was discovered in Meeteetse Wyoming in 1981 (5). Under initial protection measures this population increased in numbers but then became infected by canine distemper and plague which threatened to completely wipe out the species (5). As a last resort the final 18 wild animals were caught and brought into captivity between 1985 and 1987 and a successful captive-breeding programme has been running ever since (3) (8). The US Fish and Wildlife Service's revised 'Black-Footed Ferret Recovery Plan' of 1988 prescribed the long-term target of establishing ten or more separate self-sustaining wild populations aiming to have 1500 ferrets in the wild by 2010 (9). As of 2008 populations had been reintroduced to 18 sites and with up to 250 wild born individuals distributed amongst several of these populations the black-footed ferret was reclassified by the IUCN moving from Extinct in the Wild to Endangered (1). While this is a fantastic conservation success story wild ferret populations remain small (1) and conservation will need to continue if this species\xe2\x80\x99 future is to be secured. ,loss;disease; , ,2,0

Although it is illegal to hunt this species remaining populations are threatened by poaching even in protected areas.  Compounding the threat of hunting is the impact of habitat loss (2) (4).  90 percent of the Atlantic forest has already been cleared leaving little habitat for the black-fronted piping-guan (5). Remaining forest patches are under threat from legal and illegal conversion to agriculture and the construction of hydro-electric dams (2) (4).,The black-fronted piping-guan is protected by law in Brazil but this has little impact on the rate of poaching there. Similarly it is found in several state parks and reserves including Urugua-\xc3\xad Provincial Park and Iguaz\xc3\xba National Park both in Misiones but the security offered by these has had little effect on bolstering the species\xe2\x80\x99 numbers. There are several captive breeding programmes which have had some success but reintroduction has so far been unsuccessful.  Awareness campaigns and the enforcement of anti-poaching measures seem to be the best hope for this species with regular surveying to follow its progress (2) (4). ,loss;hunting;poaching; ,captive breeding;protected; ,3,2

Increased disturbance of breeding colonies is one of the main reasons of this decline caused by greater numbers of people animals and vehicles around rivers. Unfortunately black-footed terns will swiftly abandon their eggs and young if their breeding site is disturbed resulting in a very low number of chicks reaching maturity (5).,There are a number of measures currently in place to help halt the decline of this endangered tern. Project River Recovery managed by New Zealand\xe2\x80\x99s Department of Conservation is a restoration programme for the wildlife and plants of the braided rivers and wetlands around Twizel Tekapo and Omarama (8). As part of the project the Mackenzie River Basin is receiving protection and willows are being removed to restore the breeding habitat of black-fronted terns (7). Information signs have been erected close to large black-fronted tern colonies which aim to educate the public about the best way to enjoy and use the river while minimising the negative impacts on the birds (5). , , ,0,0

Pollution from rubbish disposal commercial run-off and septic discharge is a particular problem at several locations and can lead to nitrification promoting weed infestations.\xa0Earthworks for the establishment of sewage pipelines and poor erosion control mechanisms has also resulted in sedimentation causing swamps to dry up.\xa0Furthermore the Blue Mountains water skink\xe2\x80\x99s range is intersected by corridors of powerlines and their servicing has been identified as an additional threat through the slashing burning and spraying of pesticides that is required to gain maintenance access (4).\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0,With high levels of <strong>endemism</strong> and large numbers of threatened species the Blue Mountains home to the Blue Mountains water skink is a region of major conservation importance.\xa0Recognising this the Australian government has afforded this region extra protection beginning in 1959 with the creation of the Blue Mountains National Park and most recently the creation of the UNESCO Greater Blue Mountains World Heritage Area in 2000 (9) (10).\xa0 ,pollution; , ,1,0
Whio,Hymenolaimus malacorhynchos,Blue duck (Hymenolaimus malacorhynchos),Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Anseriformes,Anatidae,Hymenolaimus (1),Length: 53 cm (2)Male weight: 1000 g (3)Female weight: 800 g (3),Habitat loss has been one of the major causes of decline in this species. The clearance and grazing of riverside vegetation has led to the depletion of water quality in many rivers and has restricted the blue duck to less accessible mountainous areas. Predation by introduced mammals such as stoats and competition with introduced trout may also have played a part in the decrease and fragmentation of this species\xe2\x80\x99 range (2).,The New Zealand Department of Conservation published a Blue Duck Recovery Plan in 1997 in an effort to secure the survival of this species in the wild and to downgrade its current threat status. Some of the conservation measures involved include captive breeding and release attempts and the protection of key areas of habitat. Ongoing population monitoring is also a priority in the conservation of this attractive waterbird (4). ,loss;fragmentation;pet; ,captive breeding; ,3,1

A decrease in water quality was probably the most significant agent as the loss of the species from the Cahaba River coincided with an increase in nitrogen and phosphorous caused by sewage discharge. This led to higher algal biomass and decreased levels of dissolved oxygen in the water (4) (5). The blue shiner is also threatened by increased siltation as it relies on sight to detect its prey while in Georgia urbanisation and resulting pollution and water extraction threatens the species\xe2\x80\x99 habitat. In many areas the blue shiner now exists in small highly fragmented populations which are more vulnerable to habitat degradation and a loss of <strong>genetic diversity</strong> greatly increasing the species\xe2\x80\x99 extinction risk (5) (7).,The future of the blue shiner very much depends on the protection of its habitat particularly the Conasauga River. Fortunately for this rare species efforts are underway to protect this fragile environment. The Nature Conservancy is working with private landowners and government agencies to protect the Conasauga River and conserve the populations of rare and endangered fish that inhabit its waters (5) (8). The National Resources Conservation Service is also working to protect <strong>riparian</strong> habitat around the Conasauga River and to tackle threats (5) (9). The blue shiner will also benefit from further studies into its ecology threats and population trends (5). ,loss;pollution; , ,2,0

However the advent of the exploding harpoon gun in 1868 allowed for the commercial exploitation of this species with the whaling industry particularly focusing on the blue whale after 1900 (9). The slaughter peaked in 1931 when over 29000 were killed in one season (8). After that blue whales became so scarce that the whalers turned to other species. More than 360000 blue whales were taken by whaling fleets in the Southern Hemisphere from 1904 to 1967 (7) and the Antarctic and North Atlantic populations were probably depleted to the low hundreds by the time whaling ceased (1). The total global blue whale population has declined by at least 70 percent and possibly as much as 90 percent over the last three generations with the formerly very large Antarctic population declining over the same period by as much as 97 percent (1).\xa0,Hunting of the blue whale was banned in 1966 although some illegal soviet whaling persisted for several years after. No blue whales have been deliberately caught since 1978 (1). However this protection almost came too late for the blue whale and recovery has been extremely slow. Only in the last few years have there been signs that numbers may be increasing (9).\xa0 ,pollution; ,cites;protected; ,1,2

Many of the remaining habitats are fragmented and ecological barriers prevent movement of individuals between the forest fragments (1) (2). The formation of fragmented habitats has left most populations of the blue-eyed bush frog at high risk of extinction due to <strong>inbreeding</strong> stress and has increased their vulnerability to invasive species. Any further reductions in habitat area could compromise the future survival of this species (2).,Some areas within the range of the blue-eyed bush frog are protected including the Sharavathi Valley Wildlife Sanctuary Mookambika Wildlife Sanctuary and Kudremukh National Park offering it a certain degree of protection. More research is required into the range habitat requirements and populations of the blue-eyed bush frog and investigations are needed into how threats can be addressed to conserve this colourful amphibian (1).\xa0 ,invasive; ,protected; ,1,1

Aside from over-collection the extremely small range of these critically endangered frogs is threatened with habitat loss as a result of grazing fires and sapphire mining operations (1).,Listing on Appendix II of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species provides the blue-legged mantella with some protection. It requires that an export licence is obtained for any trade in this species. A trade quota to prevent over-exploitation of this frog is crucial to its survival as even the protection offered by the Isalo National Park has not prevented the capture of the blue-legged mantella (1).

Several factors have contributed to this decline. Most importantly the construction of dams and reservoirs has blocked the upstream movements of the bluntnose shiner into formerly occupied habitats (5). Water degradation from agricultural pollutants has also reduced numbers (3).,The bluntnose shiner was listed as Threatened by the US federal government in 1987 facilitating the introduction of a five year research program to look at the measures necessary for the protection of the remaining populations (5). , , ,0,0

The introduction of non-native fish to the lakes as a food source and for malaria control as well as the local use of poisons in fishing may also be affecting this species although the current impacts on the population are unknown (2). By far the biggest threat to Boeseman\xe2\x80\x99s rainbowfish however is from the overharvesting of individuals for the international aquarium fish trade. The beautiful colours of this species particularly the males have made it perhaps the most popular rainbowfish in the trade with an estimated one million individuals captured from the wild each year (1) (2) (3) (5).,The Indonesian government are reported to have restricted the trade in Boeseman\xe2\x80\x99s rainbowfish (5) but it is likely that careful controls in trade and further research into the species will be needed before its conservation status can be better known and its populations more effectively protected. ,fishing; ,protected; ,1,1

Although traditionally not targeted by hunters as a result of local taboos (9) this species is today at risk from the bushmeat trade; the demand for which has recently increased threatening much of Africa's wildlife (2).,Bonobos are protected by law and international trade is prohibited by their listing on Appendix I of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) (3). <strong>Ex-situ</strong> conservation measures cannot be relied upon as a safeguard for this species as presently no self-sustaining captive population exists (2). The precise impact of the bushmeat trade is currently being investigated by the Bushmeat Working Group part of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) (7). The United Nations Environmental Program (UNEP) has recently recognised the urgent need to protect our closest relatives and has established a Great Ape Survival Project (GRASP) aimed at identifying the conservation initiatives required to secure the future of the apes and obtaining political support and funding to allow these to be achieved (8). The Bonobo Conservation Initiative is working in the Democratic Republic of Congo to raise awareness of the plight of this species (9). The main problem in terms of bonobo conservation is that they are only found in a single protected area (Salonga National Park) and even there they are intensively hunted both for their meat as well as for the making of charms (3). Concerted conservation efforts will therefore be required to secure the future of this fascinating ape. ,loss; ,cites;protected; ,1,2

Climate change is also expected to increase ocean acidification and result in a greater frequency of extreme weather events such as destructive storms.

Europeans also hunted the brown teal excessively but it was the introduction of stoats weasels ferrets hedgehogs cats and dogs that caused the first major decline of this species. In 1921 the brown teal was declared a protected species but shooting continued and was compounded by extensive drainage of wetlands and deforestation leaving less than 10% of wetlands and 30% of native forests (3). The brown teal population stands today at just under 1000 individuals (5).,The New Zealand Department of Conservation has produced a brown teal recovery plan which is now in action. Five full time staff and a large team of volunteers monitor the ducks and control predators (3) (5). They also oversee a captive breeding programme and the resulting reintroductions. This programme has been extremely successful in producing captive-reared birds \xe2\x80\x93 for every bird taken from the wild 21.5 have been bred and released bringing the total number of reintroduced brown teal to 2000 since 1964 (3). Improvements in release techniques using supplementary feeders post-release and predator control at the release site has increased initial post-release survival rates to more than 60% (5). The captive breeding network in New Zealand consists of 20 holders made up of wildlife parks zoos and private individuals on a completely voluntary basis with no financial support. These collectively produce approximately 100 brown teal for release into the wild each year. This programme is now in the third year of releasing the birds into a major release site in Port Charles Coromandel which has proved very successful with 60 \xe2\x80\x93 70 percent survival rate of released birds which are now breeding and producing young in the wild themselves (5). , ,captive breeding; ,0,1

Although not of commercial importance (2) the brownstriped grunt is taken incidentally in other fisheries and is being increasingly caught for the marine aquarium trade (3).,There are currently no known conservation measures in place for the brownstriped grunt but specific recommendations have been made for the protection of its reef habitat through the designation of Marine Protected Areas and the regulation of its exploitation. In addition owing to the paucity of information available on this species further research into its ecology and population parameters is considered a high priority (3). ,pollution; ,protected; ,1,1

A burgeoning population and rapid development along the southeastern coastal region of Brazil has taken its toll on the natural forest habitat (2) (6).  The clearance of land for coffee plantations sugar cane cocoa eucalyptus cattle pasture and most significantly timber extraction and charcoal production has left just a tiny fraction of original forest (6).  In addition this threatened primate may also be hunted for the pet trade (1).,Despite the grim picture painted for the future of the buffy-headed marmoset\xe2\x80\x99s habitat it has been reported that this species may be able to adapt to <strong>secondary forest</strong> and that its future could be secured if provided with proper protection (2).  Currently this species is known to occur within the Nova Lombardia Biological Reserve and the forest within the lands of the Fazenda Montes Claros (a privately owned farm) (6).  This provides the buffy-headed marmoset with some protection against the threats of habitat loss but it has been advised that the land of Fazenda Montes Claros should be made into an official protected area so that its future preservation can be assured (6).  Indeed the future of the buffy-headed marmoset may rest on the effective protection of strongholds such as these (6). ,pet; ,protected; ,1,1

Two of the sites where it occurs are close to a main road and are therefore easily accessible by collectors (3). <strong>Hybridisation</strong> (cross-breeding) with other <i>Melocactus</i> species also threatens the survival of this cactus in its pure form and there is evidence of widespread hybridisation at two out of the four known sites for <i>Melocactus glaucescens</i> (2). An additional threat to the species is fire which is commonly used by farmers in the area to induce re-growth of pasture for livestock grazing (2).,<i>Melocactus glaucescens</i> has been placed on Appendix I of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) since 1992 effectively banning International Trade in wild plants of this cactus (3). The species has recently been given further protection by the formation of the Parque Estadual do Morro do Chap\xc3\xa9u; a new protected area which encompasses most of one of the known populations (2).

Only two populations of <em>Mammillaria pectinifera</em> are currently known to persist in the wild and their position is increasingly precarious due to the small isolated number of individuals and ongoing habitat disturbance. Quarrying and the dumping of rubbish are worrying threats in the area that contains the greatest number of individual plants (2).,International trade in plants and seeds of wild origin is banned by the listing of <i>Mammillaria pectinifera</i> on Appendix I of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) (3). In addition the demand for this species is being increasingly met by seed-raised plants thus reducing the pressure on wild populations (2). Further field studies are needed in the area in the hope of uncovering additional wild populations; constant monitoring of known sites is also required in order to raise the alarm for a rescue mission should this become necessary (2). , ,cites; ,0,1

Bermuda petrel,Pterodroma cahow,Cahow (Pterodroma cahow),Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Procellariiformes,Procellariidae,Pterodroma (1),Length: 38 cm (2),The huge pre-colonial cahow population was rapidly decimated by human hunting for food and by introduced pigs rats dogs and cats which eliminated it from all the larger islands (2) (4) (5). Surviving only on the smallest offshore islets where lack of soil prevented burrowing it was forced to compete for nest sites with the larger cliff-hole-nesting white-tailed tropicbird (<em>Phaethon lepturus</em>) which caused 70 percent breeding failure every year. Rat predation on new-hatched chicks remains as an occasional threat. During the 1960s and early 1970s before DDT pesticide use was banned DDT residues caused a 50 percent decline in breeding success due to eggshell thinning and embryo mortality (7). From the late 1960s through the 1990s light pollution from a nearby NASA tracking station and U.S. Naval air station inhibited new pair formation on the breeding islets (2). Erosion damage to the nesting islets from hurricane overwash has become a major problem due to global warming and sea level rise since 1995 (7).,The rediscovery of the Bermuda petrel\xe2\x80\x99s nesting grounds in 1951 enabled concerted conservation efforts and since 1961 all of the breeding sites have been intensively managed by a conservation officer employed by the Bermuda Government Ministry of the Environment. Periodic invasions of rats are controlled by trapping and baiting with anti-coagulant poisons and nest competition with tropicbirds has been eliminated by the installation of wooden entrances which exclude the larger tropicbirds. In addition man-made concrete burrows have been provided on the level tops of the islets to accommodate the cahow population increase. Furthermore since 1962 the six hectare soil-covered Nonsuch Island has been restored and kept predator-free as a much larger future home for the expanding population (7). ,hunting;pet;pollution; , ,3,0

This hunting which was particularly severe during the mid-1970s but has declined in more recent years (7) has left Calamian deer populations seriously depleted (5).,The most significant conservation measures implemented for this Endangered species to date have been the establishment of the Calauit Island Game Preserve and Wildlife Sanctuary and the introduction of 30 deer to the island (7).  In 1993 the Calamian Deer Conservation Program was also launched an initiative which has led to the undertaking of status surveys research conservation education and the formation of management recommendations.  There are no reserves on Busuanga and Culion but relatively large parts of these islands fortunately remain undeveloped and sparsely inhabited (7). ,hunting;disease; , ,2,0

Campbell Island flightless teal,Anas nesiotis,Campbell Island teal (Anas nesiotis),Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Anseriformes,Anatidae,Anas (1),Male wingspan: 128 â 138 cm (2)Female wingspan: 114 â 125 cm (2)Male weight: 290 â 500 g (2)Female weight: 280 â 265 (2),Having disappeared from much of its former range the Campbell Island teal population reached critically low numbers\xa0and\xa0has clung to a precarious existence. This bird\xe2\x80\x99s extirpation from it presumed former stronghold Campbell Island has largely been attributed to predation by introduced Norway rats (<i>Rattus norvegicus</i>) that got ashore from sealing and whaling ships in the early 19th Century (4). Present-day potential threats include the accidental introduction of predators or avian disease to Dent Island the bird\xe2\x80\x99s last natural refuge or even severe weather conditions which could have a catastrophic effect (6). Indeed with such a small current population and limited natural range this bird is now extremely vulnerable; just a single event is capable of driving it to complete extinction (5).,The outlook for the Campbell Island teal looked bleak when first rediscovered in 1975 but thankfully since then there has been fantastic progress with captive breeding programmes and the population has increased to a healthier though still unstable level (5). Captive breeding was started by New Zealand\xe2\x80\x99s Department of Conservation in 1984 from three males and one female taken from the small population on Dent Island and another four males and three females captured in 1990. The first duckling finally hatched in 1994 at the Pukaha Mt Bruce National Wildlife Centre receiving international attention and by 2000 the captive population had reached 60 (4). The Department of Conservation initially released a total of 24 captive-bred birds on to the predator-free Codfish Island in 1999 and 2000 as an insurance population and to be eventually used to restock Campbell Island (4) (5). These had an 88 percent survival rate. With this success the Department of Conservation decided to translocate captive-bred birds directly to Campbell Island made viable by a successful rat and cat eradication programme in 2001 (4). Thus 50 teal including 28 from Pukaha Mount Bruce and 22 from Codfish Island were released onto Campbell Island in September 2004 and a further 55 in September 2005 and 54 in 2006 (4) (5). A check in February 2005 found no evidence that the first batch of released birds had bred but this may be due to their being moved close to the breeding season (4). Two decades of conservation effort have brought this bird back from extinction on Campbell Island and meant that it now has a good chance of being able to recover and thrive once more in its native home (7). ,disease; ,captive breeding; ,1,1

Phoca caspica,Pusa caspica,Caspian seal (Pusa caspica),Animalia,Chordata,Mammalia,Carnivora,Phocidae,Pusa (1),up to 86 kg (2) (3),Believed to have numbered over a million at the start of the 20th Century the Caspian seal has since undergone a dramatic decline of over 90 percent due to a range of human activities (1) (8) (9) and current losses still substantially exceed recruitment of young into the population (12). The species is particularly vulnerable as the Caspian Sea is a closed system from which the seal cannot disperse (1). The main threat to the Caspian seal is intensive commercial hunting (2) (3) (5) (9) (10) which although now regulated is still likely to exceed sustainable harvest levels (1). Illegal killing and poaching also occur (8). Intensive fishing is also a problem reducing fish stocks and resulting in seals being caught as <strong>bycatch</strong> injured by boats or deliberately killed by fishermen (1) (2) (8) (9) (10). Fish stocks are also under further threat from the voracious comb jellyfish <i>Mnemiopsis leidyi</i> which invaded the Caspian Sea via ship ballast in 1999 and which rapidly consumes <strong>zooplankton</strong> as well as fish eggs and young (1) (9) (13).,A range of measures have been put in place during the last century to protect the Caspian seal such as a ban on seal nets and restrictions on hunting including the protection of adult females during the breeding season (1) (11). However legal hunting for commercial and scientific purposes still continues (1). A number of conservation projects are in place in the region including the Caspian Environment Programme (CEP) which aims to halt environmental degradation in the Caspian Sea and promote sustainable development (4) (7) and the Caspian Seal Project which is supported by bodies such as the UK Darwin Initiative and which aims to monitor the Caspian seal population work for its conservation and raise its profile as a flagship species for the region. As part of this a Seal Conservation Action and Management Plan (SCAMP) has been developed although its most important recommendations have yet to be implemented (1) (9). The Caspian Seal Conservation Network (CSCN) is also coordinating research into the species (9). ,loss;hunting;poaching;fishing;disease; ,protected; ,5,1

The original site of collection in a marsh near Durban has since been destroyed to make way for a road. These threats are exacerbated by the slug\xe2\x80\x99s already restricted range which makes it especially vulnerable to the effects of its changing environment (2).,Although there are currently no conservation measures directly targeting the caterpillar slug individuals have been observed in Hluhluwe Game Reserve where its habitat may receive some protection. Furthermore its appearance in suburban gardens in the Pietermaritzburg area suggests that this slug may be adaptable to a certain degree of habitat modification flexibility that would undoubtedly help its prospects of survival (2). ,loss;environment; , ,2,0

Caucasus viper,Vipera kaznakovi,Caucasian viper (Vipera kaznakovi),Animalia,Chordata,Reptilia,Squamata,Viperidae,Vipera (1),Body length: up to 60 cm (2),For centuries fear-driven human persecution of the Caucasian viper has diminished population numbers (2). Today this snake is also threatened by illegal capture for the international pet trade habitat loss to urbanisation agriculture dam construction in Georgia and increased tourism-based development on the coast of the Black Sea (1). As a result of these threats populations have declined significantly and some have been lost altogether. If this rate of decline continues the Caucasian viper population is likely to be halved by 2018 (1).,The Caucasian viper is subject to state and regional level legal protection (7) and some areas of its habitat are protected such as Soci National Park which contains Russia\xe2\x80\x99s largest population of the Caucasian viper. Other protected areas such as Kackazsky State Biosphere Reserve Russia are home to small populations but these remain threatened as these reserves are also tourist destinations. Education of visitors and park staff is therefore vital in areas such as these to allow conservation of the Caucasian viper (7). A few individuals of the species also occur in small protected areas in Turkey and Georgia although overall most Caucasian viper populations remain unprotected (1) (7). Therefore it is thought an increase in the extent and quality of reserves is needed including international cooperation to establish a network of protected areas along the coast of the Black Sea (7). ,loss;pet; ,protected; ,2,1

Like other iguana species this beautiful creature is subject to many human-related threats including: destruction of habitats for farming residential and commercial developments; road casualties; trapping or shooting by farmers who perceive iguanas as a threat to their crops; and predation by wild and domestic cats and dogs (4) (7). Large scale deforestation and road construction has also increased enormously in the eastern districts over the last decade and is only expected to accelerate (7).,The Cayman Island blue iguana is fully protected under local legislation and kept out of international trade by its listing on Appendix I of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) (1). The National Trust for the Cayman Islands has established an integrated conservation programme incorporating research habitat protection captive breeding re-introduction/restocking and conservation education (7). These iguanas are being bred successfully in captivity and are subsequently released after two years into the Queen Elizabeth II Botanic Park and Salina Reserve (1) (4). Blue iguana populations in this reserve are being promoted as a major ecotourism attraction proving beneficial to both the Park and the iguanas (1). It seems that the future of wild blue iguanas must rest on managed populations in protected areas but suitable land is scarce on Grand Cayman (4). Thus despite encouraging conservation efforts the Cayman Island blue iguana still clings to a precarious existence (5) and more protected land must be obtained if there is any hope of securing its future in the wild (4). , ,cites;captive breeding;protected; ,0,3

All species of peccary in the Gran Chaco are hunted for their meat by local people even in the national parks. This species is particularly susceptible as they frequently dust bathe in groups in open spaces including on roads and often react to danger by standing their ground rather than fleeing. This behaviour enables hunters to eliminate whole groups in one encounter (4).,Hunting of all wildlife in Paraguay is officially prohibited and its exportation in Argentina is illegal. However such regulations seem to be ignored and un-enforced as hunting of the Chacoan peccary exists across its range. In 1990 a conservation action plan for this species was submitted to the Paraguayan Government and in 1991 a similar plan was given to relevant authorities in Bolivia and Argentina (4). ,hunting;disease; , ,2,0

Black robin,Petroica traversi,Chatham Island black robin (Petroica traversi),Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Muscicapidae,Petroica (1),23.4 g (2),The introduction of mammalian predators such as rats and cats to the Chatham Islands following European settlement caused a rapid and deleterious decline in black robin numbers; the species became extinct on all but one island (6). By 1880 the species was restricted to around ten hectares of woody vegetation on a mammal-free rock-stack known as Little Mangere Island (5). Habitat loss on this island further threatened the species however and prompted an intensive conservation programme that began in the 1970s (5). Today a population of around 250 to 300 birds exists on two small islands: Mangere and Rangatira (or South East) Islands (6). Although all are descended from just one pair and are genetically identical there are no apparent deleterious effects resulting from their small gene pool (6). The possibility of accidental predator introduction remains a threat (2).,In the 1970s habitat loss on Little Mangere Island was so severe that the population of seven birds was moved to Mangere Island. By 1980 however the situation had reached crisis point with only five birds left in the world including only a single breeding pair (5). The New Zealand Wildlife Service began '<strong>cross-fostering</strong>' eggs and young from this remaining pair of robins (known as 'old blue' and 'old yellow') to another species in an effort to increase productivity (4) (5). This innovative approach was a resounding success; today between 250 and 300 birds are distributed on Mangere and Rangatira Islands and there are plans to introduce a population to the much larger Pitt Island once it has been cleared of pests (4) (6). This is a remarkable conservation success story and an example of what can be achieved (5). ,loss; , ,1,0
Animalia,Haematopus chathamensis,Chatham Island oystercatcher (Haematopus chathamensis),Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Charadriiformes,Haematopodidae,Haematopus (1),Length: 48 cm (2),Chatham Island oystercatchers are vulnerable to different threats due to the small size of their population (2). Population estimates in 1987 found numbers to be worryingly low; at just over 100 individuals (3). On Pitt and Chatham Islands introduced predators pose the major threat to the survival of this species. Sheep and cattle also cause problems by trampling on eggs and chicks (3). On Chatham Island introduced marram grass has spread onto the open areas where these oystercatchers prefer to nest forcing birds to nest too near to the waters edge where eggs are vulnerable to high tides (2).,In 1998 the New Zealand Department of Conservation began an intensive oystercatcher management programme (3). Methods used to enhance the survival of the species include: predator control the protection of nesting sites with fences and moving of nests away from the high tide mark (3). Efforts have been encouragingly successful and the population has increased significantly in the past 10 years (2). , , ,0,0
Chatham Island petrel; Chatham Islands petrel,Pterodroma axillaris,Chatham petrel (Pterodroma axillaris),Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Procellariiformes,Procellariidae,Pterodroma (1),200 g (2),The main threat to the Chatham petrel is competition for burrows with the broad-billed prion (<em>Pachyptila vittata</em>) which breeds earlier in the year leaving the Chatham petrel at a competitive disadvantage (7). The broad-billed prion is also known to attack eggs chicks and occasionally adults causing burrow evictions and high rates of mortality in young Chatham petrels (10). Broad-billed prion interference has also been proposed as a contributing factor in pair bond disruption (4).,Intensive research into the reasons for the decline of the Chatham petrel in the last two decades has led to several conservation actions. Breeding burrows have been artificially blockaded to prevent occupation by the competing broad-billed prion and any prions found invading petrel burrows during absences are culled. Installation of neoprene flaps to burrow entrances has helped reduce broad-billed prion interference during the incubation period and continual burrow monitoring and artificial nest site protection has significantly improved Chatham petrel breeding success (11). ,loss;invasive;pet; ,protected; ,3,1

Animalia,Diglossa gloriosissima,Chestnut-bellied flower-piercer (Diglossa gloriosissima),Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Thraupidae,Diglossa (1),Length: 14.5 cm (2),There are a number of threats to the habitat in the very small range of the chestnut-bellied flower-piercer including the expansion of human settlements extensive deforestation livestock grazing and intentional and accidental fires (6). However the chestnut-bellied flower-piercer is apparently able to tolerate some habitat degradation (6).,After a worrying 40 years of no records sightings of the chestnut-bellied flower-piercer since 2004 have given hope for the conservation of this endangered bird (3). The chestnut-bellied flower-piercer has been recorded from two protected areas Paramillo and Munchique National Parks (6) although the level of protection this actually offers is not clear. Increased support and enforcement of these two national parks has been recommended by BirdLife International in addition to further surveys to determine the population size and exact distribution of this species (6). , ,protected; ,0,1
Amazilia VentricastaÃ±a,Amazilia castaneiventris,Chestnut-bellied hummingbird (Amazilia castaneiventris),Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Apodiformes,Trochilidae,Amazilia (1),Average head-body length: 9 cm (2),Inhabiting a region with a large human population and intensive agriculture the chestnut-bellied hummingbird is suffering from extensive habitat loss. The status of this species has been somewhat unclear having been unrecorded over recent decades but it is now obvious that this rare species occupies a vulnerable position in a number of small fragmented populations (4). Deforestation has become progressively prevalent in the Colombian Andes with large tracts of forest replaced by coffee and sugarcane plantations pasture and crop cultivation (5) (7). Mining activity largely stimulated by a gold rush in 1996 has also had negative effects on the environment through habitat loss pollution and increased human immigration (4) (7).,Fortunately for the chestnut-bellied hummingbird it is the target of numerous conservation measures. Since 2002 the Colombian conservation organisations Fundaci\xc3\xb3n Colibri Organizacion Ambiental Ocotea and Fundacion Ecodiversidad have been directing community involvement projects in a reserve that supports the species. In 2008 they also began a banding and nest monitoring scheme and have undertaken awareness campaigns involving school children (8). Furthermore Fundaci\xc3\xb3n ProAves in collaboration with the Amercian Bird Conservancy have successfully created the Pauxi Pauxi reserve and the Cerulean Warbler Reserve and are working to protect the forests there (9). The chestnut-bellied hummingbird is also afforded sanctuary in the newly established Chicamocha National Park (4). ,loss;environment;pollution; , ,3,0

Viable habitat for this species of hummingbird is therefore scarce.,Further research into the natural ecology of this species is urgently required in order to understand the nature of resources needed to sustain the population. Exports of hummingbirds from Peru and Chile are controlled (2) and this species is listed on Appendix II of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) (3). , ,cites; ,0,1

Deforestation in west Africa is most severe and remaining pockets of undisturbed forest are home to highly fragmented populations of chimpanzees (8). The demand for <strong>bushmeat</strong> has recently exploded due in part to the growing human population more accessible forests and the increased availability of firearms (4); some conservationists believe this trade is currently the biggest threat to species' survival in the area. Exposure to human diseases presents a further threat to the chimpanzee (8).,Chimpanzees are protected by law throughout their range although this is often poorly enforced. The precise impact of the <strong>bushmeat</strong> trade is currently being investigated by the <strong>Bushmeat</strong> Working Group part of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) (9). The United Nations Environmental Program (UNEP) has recently recognised the urgent need to protect our closest relatives and has established a Great Ape Survival Project (GRASP) aimed at identifying the conservation initiatives required to secure the future of the apes and obtaining political support and funding to allow these to be achieved (10). The Jane Goodall Institute amongst other organisations is involving local people in chimp conservation in the form of sanctuaries and education programmes (5). ,loss;disease; ,cites;protected; ,2,2

According to some estimates up to 15 million turtles are traded in the region each year with the majority ending up in China where the country\xe2\x80\x99s rapidly developing economy is fuelling a demand for expensive foods and traditional medicines made from turtles (7). The Chinese stripe-necked turtle is just one of the many species now considered at risk of extinction due to China\xe2\x80\x99s insatiable demand for turtle products (1).,In some areas Chinese stripe-necked turtle farms have been established predominantly to supply the pet trade (8). While this may benefit this Endangered species by lessening pressure on wild populations turtle farms can sometimes present a cover for illegal activities as turtles collected in the wild are passed through farms as offspring of the captive turtles (7). In China a capture permit is required before trapping wild Chinese stripe-necked turtles (9). However weak enforcement and low awareness pose significant obstacles to laws and other measures which seek to secure a future for the threatened freshwater turtles of Asia (7). ,pet; , ,1,0

In addition to this legislation some of this lizard\xe2\x80\x99s habitat receives much-needed protection.  In 1985 the Coachella Valley National Wildlife Refuge was established to protect the fringe-toed lizard (3) followed by the creation of the Coachella Valley Preserve which encompasses an additional area of lizard habitat adjacent to the Wildlife Refuge (6).

Because of their low birth rates slow reproductive turnover and sometimes restricted range stingarees are particularly susceptible to the damaging effects of over-fishing (4).,The coastal stingaree occurs in the Great Australian Bight Marine Park (GAB) within which exists a <strong>Benthic</strong> Protection Zone (BPZ) that affords some degree of protection to this bottom-dwelling species. However the Park\xe2\x80\x99s mission is not only to maintain current levels of biodiversity but also to provide ecologically sustainable use of marine resources. As such a number of fisheries and recreational fishing are still permitted to operate in certain areas and exploratory drilling for petroleum commenced in 2003 and further exploration activity is anticipated in the future (5). These activities may threaten the coastal stingaree and there are currently no conservation measures directly targeting the species. ,fishing; , ,1,0

The history of exploitation continues today and the collection of nuts has virtually stopped all natural regeneration of populations (4) with the exception of the introduced population on Silhouette. This palm has been lost from the wild from three Seychelles islands within its former range (4). Habitat loss is one of the major threats to the survival of remaining populations there have been numerous fires on the islands of Praslin and Curieuse and only immature trees remain over large parts of these islands (4).,The Seychelles is a World Heritage Site and a third of the area is now protected (3). The main populations of coco-de-mer palms are found within the Praslin and Curieuse National Parks (4) and the trade in nuts is controlled by the Coco-de-mer (Management) Decree of 1995 (4). Firebreaks also exist at key sites in an effort to prevent devastating fires from sweeping through populations (4). Cultivated palms are grown on a number of other islands and are widely present in botanic gardens; although the collection of seeds in order to recruit these populations may be a further threat to the remaining natural stands (4). Conservation priorities are the continued protection of populations enforcement of regulations and effective fire control (4). It is hoped that these measures will be sufficient to secure the future of this magnificent palm tree. ,loss; ,protected; ,1,1

Animalia,Cyprinodon elegans,Comanche Springs pupfish (Cyprinodon elegans),Animalia,Chordata,Actinopterygii,Cyprinodontiformes,Cyprinodontidae,Cyprinodon (1),Maximum length: 62mm (2),The small range of the Comanche Springs pupfish means that small changes in the environment can lead to drastic reductions in the overall population size. The main threat to this species is thought to be habitat loss which is occurring due to excessive groundwater pumping for agriculture (1). The Comanche Spring pupfish has become locally extinct in the spring where it was discovered due to groundwater extraction (1) and excessive water removal is still a problem in the area as much more water being removed than being replaced by rainfall (3). Other threats to this species include competition and <strong>hybridisation</strong> with non-native species such as the sheepshead minnow (<em>Cyprinodon variegatus</em>) (14). An especially large population of this <strong>invasive</strong> fish lives in Lake Balmorhea and the upstream dispersal of this population is proving to be detrimental to the Comanche Springs pupfish (15).,Current conservation efforts for this species are focussed on moderating water level fluctuations and removing <strong>invasive</strong> species (1). A man-made refugium and cienega were constructed in Balmorhea State Park in 1996 in an attempt to provide the Comanche Springs pupfish with a habitat that is not at risk of being drained (15). This wetland area has been located within the boundaries of the natural cienega in an effort to make it resemble and function similarly to the original habitat of this species (16). This conservation measure has proved to be a success and the area is now home to the world\xe2\x80\x99s largest Comanche Springs pupfish population. Additionally it is hoped that the removal of the <strong>invasive</strong> sheepshead minnow will help the Comanche Springs pupfish population to recover by eliminating unnatural competition (17). ,loss;environment;invasive;pet; , ,4,0

Its disappearance from a site in West Cornwall was due to the surfacing of a lay-by.,This species' rarity and the precarious state of its habitat meant that it was included in the original UK Biodiversity Action Plans for species and it is also listed in English Nature's Species Recovery Programme (SRP). Initial work on conserving the Cornish path moss concentrated on maintaining the plant's only known site and in 1996 it was designated a Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI). With the moss's sites now under protection a management plan was produced and an <glos><i>ex-situ</i></glos> conservation programme was begun to propagate the moss and allow for possible introduction to other suitable sites. This was part of the bryophyte conservation programme run by the Royal Botanic Gardens Kew and should provide an insurance safeguard against the extinction of this species in the wild. However the most important issue is to ensure that the natural populations remain viable and the major conservation efforts are being directed towards this goal. ,loss; , ,1,0

During bleaching the <strong>symbiotic</strong> <strong>algae</strong> are expelled resulting in weak and vulnerable corals that are susceptible to disease. Climate change may also increase the severity of <strong>El Ni\xc3\xb1o</strong> events and storms with strong waves and currents which destroy coral reefs. Greater levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere also cause increased ocean acidification which can reduce a coral\xe2\x80\x99s ability to create its hard skeleton. In addition rising sea levels may cause less sun to reach the coral thereby decreasing <strong>photosynthesis</strong> (1).,In addition to being listed on Appendix II of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) which makes it an offence to trade <em>Ctenella chagius</em> without a permit this coral falls within several Marine Protected Areas across its range. The recommended measures for preserving this species include more research into suitable habitats population numbers and the threats to the species as well as identifying establishing and managing new protected areas along with expanding existing protected areas. Disease also needs to be managed and controlled and it is further recommended that colonies should be artificially grown as an extra safety measure (1). ,fishing;invasive;disease;pollution; ,cites;protected; ,4,2

Potential threats to the habitat in the Zapata region include drainage the expansion of agriculture and the associated pollution. Logging and grazing in swamps also alters the habitat to which the Cuban sparrow is adapted to (5). Subspecies <i>T.i.varonai</i> is threatened by habitat loss resulting from the expansion of the tourism industry and the cactus scrub habitat in Guantanamo is threatened by grazing felling of trees and the habitat conversion associated with increased urbanization (5).,Each of the subspecies has been recorded occurring within a protected area. For example in Zapata there is a UNESCO Biosphere Reserve a Ramsar site and also the Zapata Peninsula National Park. However the level of actual protection they offer the Cuban sparrow is variable. Increased protection to the areas they inhabit as well as investigation into proposed developments in these regions with steps taken to reduce the impact on Cuban sparrows is recommended to protect the future of this endangered bird (4). ,loss;pollution; ,protected; ,2,1

Currently the decline continues due to the conversion of habitat to agricultural land and grazing grounds for livestock (2).,Whilst Cuvier\xe2\x80\x99s gazelle occurs mainly in protected areas in Tunisia this is not the case in Morocco and Algeria (2) (7). With a large stock of captive animals <strong>re-introduction</strong> programmes are underway in some of its former range (Tunisia) (5) (7). Suitable habitat is available but safe corridors between protected areas as well as access to waterholes are needed to enable Cuvier\xe2\x80\x99s gazelle to re-establish itself successfully in these regions. The Centre for Saharan Fauna in Almeria Spain has the largest captive population of Cuvier\xe2\x80\x99s gazelle but there are others including North America (5). ,hunting; ,protected; ,1,1

On Hispaniola only two of the original <strong>endemic</strong> land mammal species now remain including Cuvier\xe2\x80\x99s hutia (3) (4) but the species is under serious threat from a combination of habitat loss hunting for food persecution as a crop pest and predation by introduced species such as dogs cats and mongooses. The species has been lost from much of its former range and its numbers have been drastically reduced (1) (2) (3) (5). The human population on Hispaniola is increasing and much of the forest has already been cleared for agriculture firewood harvesting charcoal production and urban and tourist development (2) (3) (8) (9). Some geographically distinct populations of Cuvier\xe2\x80\x99s hutia such as the proposed <strong>subspecies</strong> <em>P. a. hylaeum</em> may already be extinct (3) (4).,Cuvier\xe2\x80\x99s hutia occurs in a number of protected areas although habitat destruction may still be continuing within these (1). Very little is currently known about this unusual rodent (1) and further population surveys and molecular analyses are needed to better determine its status and that of any potential <strong>subspecies</strong> (3) (4). Hutias have even been suggested as potential candidates for raising commercially as a food source although Cuvier\xe2\x80\x99s hutia may be less suitable for this than one of its Cuban relatives Desmarest\xe2\x80\x99s hutia (<em>Capromys pilorides</em>) due to its smaller size and slower reproduction (10). ,loss;hunting; ,protected; ,2,1

The slow growth and reproductive rates typical of cycads may limit the ability of the <i>Dioon spinulosum</i> population to recover from any significant losses.,Cycads are of great conservation interest as they are an ancient group with considerable economic benefits to horticulture and the pharmaceutical industry as well as being important to soil health and fertility through nitrogen fixing (6). <i>Dioon spinulosum</i> receives some protection from international trade under its listing on Appendix II of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) (4) although increasing numbers of <i>Dioon</i> cycads have been used in gardening and landscaping within Mexico (2). There have been some efforts to propagate this species in captivity such as at the Royal Botanic Gardens at Kew (5). A cycad action plan published by the IUCN Cycad Specialist Group recommends a range of conservation measures for cycad species including setting up reserves and sustainable nurseries undertaking censuses regularly updating the <strong>taxonomy</strong> and status of the world\xe2\x80\x99s cycads and identifying the specific conservation needs and the actions required to preserve this unique group of plants (7). ,loss; ,cites; ,1,1

In addition this cycad is used in numerous ways by the local human population and some of this exploitation is having a negative impact on cycad numbers. <i>Cycas circinalis</i> is heavily harvested for its leaves with young leaves being used as food and medicine by indigenous and local communities and the mature leaves being sold in the floriculture industry (7). The biggest impact on <i>C. circinalis </i>populations however comes from the harvest of pith and male cone for the medicinal plant industry. While much of this harvest is illegal it is very difficult to patrol (7). It is not only the cycad itself that this harvesting may threaten; the harvesting of its seeds for human consumption appears to have little negative impact on <i>Cycas circinalis</i> populations but very heavy seed harvest could have an impact on the bats which reportedly feed on the seeds (7).,Significant populations of <i>Cycas circinalis</i> still exist in a number of national parks and forest reserves (2) which offers this species some protection. To reduce harvesting pressure on populations it has been suggested that people need to be encouraged to use substitutes. For example the floriculture industry could use leaves from cultivated palms that are faster growing. A substitute for the pith and male cone for the medicinal plant industry is not likely and thus in these cases populations need to be increased through cultivation (7). , , ,0,0

Although collecting of plants from the wild in the new world has been less severe\xa0than in parts of Africa several Mexican species including <em>D. caputoi</em> have been decimated by collectors\xa0(4). During the 1980s in particular local people report that large numbers of <em>D. caputoi</em> were extracted illegally. None of the four remaining populations of <em>D. caputoi</em> number more than 120 individuals and all are mostly comprised of adult plants due to poor natural recruitment of seedlings\xa0(5).,<em>Dioon caputoi </em>receives some protection from international trade under its listing on Appendix II of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) (3). Nonetheless a range of additional conservation measures are still urgently needed for this Critically Endangered species. This includes: efforts to halt the illegal extraction of plants and further deforestation within the remaining populations; the monitoring of population dynamics as part of a long-term management plan; and the reintroduction of artificially propagated plants\xa0(5). , ,cites; ,0,1

Milos viper,Macrovipera schweizeri,Cyclades blunt-nosed viper (Macrovipera schweizeri),Animalia,Chordata,Reptilia,Squamata,Viperidae,Macrovipera (1),Average length: 60 â 70 cm (2),The Cyclades blunt-nosed viper has become seriously threatened as a result of habitat destruction road mortality and removal by man. Two big quarries are in continuous operation on western Milos which have considerably increased in size over the last 15 years and destroyed large areas of pristine habitat. Additionally there are plans for more quarries on western Milos which pose an extremely significant threat to this critically endangered species. Fires also cause habitat destruction destroying the large bushes and trees in which the main prey birds are found. During the period of \xe2\x80\x98reforestation\xe2\x80\x99 after a fire goat and sheep grazing can be highly destructive preventing trees and large bushes from growing. At present tourism does not threaten the snake\xe2\x80\x99s habitat but a new airport planned for Milos may increase tourism to a level that is damaging to viper habitats. The other islands appear to provide fairly pristine untouched habitat and the populations there are healthy although a little smaller than on Milos (2).,The Regional Development Agency of Cyclades is implementing a project called \xe2\x80\x98Protection and Promotion of the Habitats and Species of the Milos Island Natura 2000 Area\xe2\x80\x99 focussing on three main actions. Firstly monitoring of the region\xe2\x80\x99s habitats and species including this viper are to be ongoing. Secondly efforts will be made to raise public awareness of the threats that face Milos\xe2\x80\x99 flora and fauna including promoting Milos Island as a destination of great ecological and ecotourism value (6). Not only could the dissemination of information help reduce intentional killing of the snake but it could also help instil a sense of pride in the local fauna and encourage local inhabitants to support the police in their struggle against snake hunters (2). Finally roads will be made safer for crossing vipers through the construction of barriers and underground passages. The Standing Committee of the Bern Convention has also recommended that there is stronger and stricter police control of illegal trade in the species (6). Further conservation actions advocated include the establishment of protected areas with optimal habitats and connective corridors and the eradication of feral cats if studies verify the threat they pose to young snakes (2). A captive breeding programme has been started in collaboration with Jersey Zoo and a similar programme has been proposed for Budapest Zoo and Botanical Gardens (3) which will provide an important buffer against extinction and offer potential for future reintroductions into the wild. ,pet; ,captive breeding;protected; ,1,2

Huchen,Hucho hucho,Danube salmon (Hucho hucho),Animalia,Chordata,Actinopterygii,Salmoniformes,Salmonidae,Hucho (1),up to 53 kg (2),Once widespread the Danube salmon is now amongst the most endangered fish species in Europe (3) (8). Numbers have been massively depleted due to overexploitation industrial and agricultural pollution deforestation (causing increased water temperatures) water redirection and badly designed or non-existent fish ladders in dams and reservoirs (2) (6). Barriers and dams are major obstacles for spawning fish and prevent genetic exchange between sub-populations (8). In addition the fish\xe2\x80\x99s popularity with anglers as a sports fish has probably also contributed to the species\xe2\x80\x99 decline (2). As a result of these combined threats the Danube salmon is now common in only around 33% of its former range rare in 28 % and has disappeared completely from 39 % (4).,Conservation efforts to date have involved the establishment of reserves restocking of populations and introductions into rivers not previously inhabited by the species legal restrictions on fishing times and quotas and even a total ban on fishing the Danube salmon in most European countries (4) (6). Unfortunately none of the measures have had long-term success partly due to the continuing pollution of rivers (4) (6). It has therefore been advocated that total protection should be given to the Danube salmon\xe2\x80\x99s habitat with particular focus on the halting of pollution and that more ecologically sound fishery management protocols be implemented (6). ,pollution; , ,1,0

Since its discovery the species has been protected with initial measures focussing on protecting individual trees rather than whole populations. Although this prevented the species from direct threats through agricultural encroachment and firewood collecting the natural habitats surrounding dawn redwood trees have been severely degraded. In place of natural forests with a diversity of tree species forests dominated by dawn redwood trees have arisen. This has had the adverse affect of providing ideal conditions for insect pest species to thrive while the largest oldest trees are more vulnerable to lightening strikes (8).\xa0,With a small population and a highly fragmented distribution the survival of the dawn redwood is dependant upon the successful implementation of conservation measures (1). Recognising this the Chinese government gave the dawn redwood protected status in 1980 while <strong>ex-situ</strong> nurseries have also been established with the aim of increasing the species\xe2\x80\x99 <strong>genetic diversity</strong> (9) (10). A number of reserves have been created to protect the remaining trees and it has been recommended that the largest and oldest trees should receive additional protection. It has also been recommended that the natural plant communities that were original associated with this species should be restored and that lightening conductors should be attached to the largest trees (8) (11).\xa0\xa0\xa0 ,pollution; ,protected; ,1,1

In the absence of catch limits the single most significant threat to this species is unsustainable collection for the pet trade. It has declined at an alarming rate of around 70 percent since 2004 and is now reduced to highly fragmented relict populations (1) (3) (4) (8).,A conservation priority for the recovery of the Denison barb is to reduce the number of fish caught in fisheries as at present this is likely unsustainable. The Government of Kerala has introduced regulations for catch limits and restrictions on the use of fishing gear while plans have been developed for designated no-take zones and specific Denison barb sanctuaries. The listing of the species on India\xe2\x80\x99s National Wildlife Protection Act should also ensure that trade is carefully regulated (7). ,fishing;pet; , ,2,0

Historically hunters viewed dholes as competition and thus persecuted them; bounties were also offered for their pelts (4). Today habitat loss and the elimination of prey species pose the greatest threats to the survival of the dhole (4). Diseases such as distemper and rabies possibly spread by domestic dogs are important threats to the Indian <strong>subspecies</strong> <i>C. a. primaevus</i> (2).,Dholes are protected throughout most of their range in India they are protected under Schedule I of the Wildlife Act of 1972 and hunting has also been prohibited in Russia since 1971 (2). In India and Nepal dholes are protected within many tiger reserves and this has helped to keep their stronghold in southern India (4). More data is urgently needed on dhole distribution and numbers and the Dhole Conservation Programme is working to achieve this and to develop a Dhole Action Plan to safeguard the future of this remarkable canid (5). ,loss;disease;pet; ,protected; ,3,1
PropithÃ¨que Ã DiadÃ¨me,Propithecus diadema,Diademed sifaka (Propithecus diadema),Animalia,Chordata,Mammalia,Primates,Indriidae,Propithecus (1),4.75 â 8.5 kg (2),Like many Malagasy primates the diademed sifaka is primarily threatened by the destruction of its rainforest habitat. <strong>Primary forests</strong> are being cleared to make way for agriculture the extraction of timber and charcoal production (1) (2). Worryingly it appears that this species may be sensitive to even slight disturbances as it has vanished from areas which have suffered only a little degradation (2). This species is also hunted for food an activity which is having a serious detrimental impact even on populations that lie within supposedly protected areas (1).,The diademed sifaka occurs in a number of national parks and reserves for example Mantadia and Zahamena National Parks but unfortunately this does not always offer the species protection from the threat of hunting (1). A conservation action plan for lemurs compiled in 1992 stated that better protection of such areas is a necessary conservation action for this species (8). The plan also suggested that a captive breeding programme should be developed (8); for many years there has only been one male diademed sifaka held in captivity in Duke Lemur Centre in North Carolina USA (9). , ,captive breeding; ,0,1

It is not known why this marsupial is so rare although surveys suggest various factors. Land clearing and habitat fragmentation are thought to be significant causes of its decline. In addition the frequent burning of heathland and litter may reduce the availability of invertebrates in the area. Predation by introduced mammals such as foxes and cats are also considered a threat to this species (4).,In 1992 a recovery plan for this species was developed by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources (IUCN) addressing the threats facing this species (4). Predation by foxes and cats has now been brought under control by The Department of Conservation and Land Management (CALM) and in the last decade dibbler numbers have started to increase (5). Perth Zoo has been working with CALM to establish a captive breeding stock of over 100 individuals of this species (6). They have also translocated a group of dibblers to Escape Island; a predator free island which has suitable habitat for this marsupial. Here radio tracking devices and trapping practices will be used to monitor the populations (5). Considering that the dibbler was on the brink of extinction this recovery plan has been a great success. It is however essential to maintain these conservation efforts as the dibbler is still regarded as a severely endangered animal (1). ,fragmentation; ,captive breeding; ,1,1

Although Moni tribesmen do not hunt the dingiso due to their belief that these are ancestral spirits it was hoped that this name would deter neighbouring people who do not hold these beliefs from hunting this <strong>marsupial</strong> (5).,At present there are no known conservation measures specifically in place for the dingiso. However conservation organisations are working to protect and preserve the remarkable wildlife of New Guinea such as WWF which aims to promote responsible forestry and improved protected area management (6). As the Indonesian government does not have abundant resources to deal with conservation issues it may be down to western nations to implement conservation initiatives for the dingiso and other fascinating tree kangaroos (4). ,hunting; ,protected;wwf; ,1,2

It is believed to be uncommon within its narrow and severely fragmented range and is likely to be under threat from the development of coastal areas for tourism and military purposes. Its habitat may also be declining in quality for example through the removal of ground cover as driftwood is collected for fuel. The species is not known to exist in modified habitats (1).,Doumergue\xe2\x80\x99s skink occurs in the Chafarine Hunting Reserve in the Chafarinas islands Spain as well as in the Sebkha Bou Areg and Embouchure Moulouya protected areas in Morocco (1). However no specific conservation measures are known to be in place for this small reptile and further research into its ecology life history and the threats it faces are likely to be needed if the species is to be given effective protection. , ,protected; ,0,1

The drill is under additional pressure from hunting as the sweet 'bushmeat' of this species is an important income for many people in the region (3). Large groups of noisy drills either on the ground or within range amongst the trees make an easy target for hunters and cleared forests are ever more accessible (3).,In 1995 the drill was identified as an important priority for conservation due to its taxonomic uniqueness; it has only one close relative (3). It is listed on Appendix I of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) thus prohibiting international trade (2). In the wild only a single population is known to occur within a protected area the Korup Reserve in Cameroon (7). Fauna and Flora International (FFI) are involved in the Drill Rehabilitation and Breeding Centre Nigeria which aims to rehabilitate young orphaned drills and to raise awareness of the plight of this species in the local area (7). In addition there are over 40 drills in captivity around the world some of which have been successfully bred (7). This may provide a last redoubt against the extinction of this magnificent species. ,hunting; ,cites;protected; ,1,2

Dramatic population declines have occurred in some areas with declines of over 99 percent recorded between 1976 to 1977 and 1996 to 1997 and the dumb gulper shark may now only be present in reasonable numbers in areas that cannot be trawled. <em>Centrophorus</em> species are harvested for meat and liver oil but the low reproductive rate late age of maturity and long lifespan typical of these deep-water sharks means that species such as the dumb gulper shark are unable to recover quickly after depletion (1).,In 2003 management changes to the South East Trawl Fishery (SETF) by the Australian Fisheries Management Authority brought in new limits to the permissible catch of dumb gulper sharks. In addition the livers of <em>Centrophorus</em> species were not allowed to be retained unless the carcasses from which they were obtained were also landed. In Australia recommendations have also been made to list the dumb gulper shark as an Endangered species on the Environmental Protection and Biodiversity Conservation (EPBC) Act a listing that would require that a Recovery Plan be put in place for this little-known deepwater shark (1). ,fishing; , ,1,0

Dusky perch,Epinephelus marginatus,Dusky grouper (Epinephelus marginatus),Animalia,Chordata,Actinopterygii,Perciformes,Serranidae,Epinephelus (1),up to 60 kg (2),As a popular food fish the primary threat to the dusky grouper is over exploitation from commercial fisheries across its range (1) although adult fish are also caught as trophies particularly by spearfishing (9). Over-fishing and spearfishing have caused a dramatic decline in numbers over the last few decades leaving dusky grouper populations seriously depleted mainly in the north-western Mediterranean (5). The slow growth rate late onset of maturity and complex reproductive biology of this species compound these threats by making it harder for it to withstand or recover from high fishing pressure (1). The fact that it also forms <strong>spawning</strong> aggregations combined with its large size makes this fish particularly easy to catch and therefore vulnerable to over-harvesting (1). Indeed despite insufficient data from many range countries alarming declines have been recorded in Europe and the Mediterranean (mainly north-western) and there are also reports that <strong>spawning</strong> aggregations are being specifically targeted in Brazil (1).,Spearfishing of this species has been banned since 1993 in France (Mediterranean coast only) with evidence of small recoveries in this area (1). A number of Marine Protected Areas have also been established where the habitat of the fish is protected or where fishing is prohibited (1) (9). In South Africa the dusky grouper is part of a \xe2\x80\x98restricted group\xe2\x80\x99 of species governed by a bag limit of five fish a day (1). Additionally the dusky grouper was recently added to the endangered <strong>teleost</strong> list in Annex 3 to the Berne Convention (1996) under which management measures must be planned and aquaculture maintaining and breeding techniques developed in order to increase and repopulate endangered stocks (5). Unfortunately this fish does not adapt well to living and reproducing in aquariums (2) and research into successful husbandry techniques is therefore ongoing (5). ,fishing; ,protected; ,1,1

There is very low commercial demand for this tiny chameleon and currently no legal export quota for this species exists<em>. </em>However the continued degradation of the dry forest in and around Tsingy de Bemaraha National Park is cause for concern because even small changes to forest structure might have a negative impact on this species (5).,The dwarf chameleon occurs in the Tsingy de Bemaraha National Park and probably also the Bemaraha Strict Nature Reserve (6) (7). Protected areas provide this species with some protection but do not completely eliminate the threats of illegal harvesting and habitat degradation as a result of fires cattle damage and timber exploitation (5) (7).\xa0The dwarf chameleon is also listed on Appendix II of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) meaning that trade in this species should be carefully controlled in order to be compatible with their survival (1).\xa0 , ,cites;protected; ,0,2

All the sub-populations grow on rocky outcrops where they face the additional threat of landslides. Concerns have also been raised that dwarf jellico is under threat from hybridisation with another St Helena endemic large jellico (<i>Sium bracteatum</i>) (1).,Some dwarf jellico subpopulations are protected within the Diana\xe2\x80\x99s Peak National Park which is protected by a management plan (1). In the past efforts have been made to ensure survival of this species by collecting seeds and planting seedlings in suitable habitat (1) (2).

Plantae,Encephalartos horridus,Eastern Cape blue cycad (Encephalartos horridus),Plantae,Tracheophyta,Cycadopsida,Cycadales,Zamiaceae,Encephalartos (1),Stem length: up to 1 m (2),Over the past few decades many South African cycads have become increasingly scarce in the wild with many species now facing the very real threat of extinction. Various factors account for their decline but the main threats include illegal harvesting for horticulture food and medicine habitat loss and the spread of alien vegetation (10). Although once abundant the Eastern Cape blue cycad has suffered significant declines due to heavy harvesting of wild specimens while urban development has destroyed several populations (2) (5) (10).,There are not known to be any specific conservation measures in place for this Endangered species but like all South African cycads the Eastern Cape blue cycad is partially protected by its listing on Appendix I of CITES which permits trade only under exceptional circumstances (3). In addition on account of its increasing prevalence in nurseries and private collections there is no longer such a strong incentive to poach this species from the wild (5) (6). ,loss; ,cites;protected; ,1,2

Siltation drainage and pollution also pose further threats to this species as they destroy freshwater habitats by lowering the water table sometimes turning permanent waterbodies into temporary water sources (1) (3) (8).,The Conasauga River runs through fairly rugged inaccessible country in national forests in Tennessee and Georgia which affords some level of protection to Edmund\xe2\x80\x99s snaketail in these areas.

In Africa declines have been caused by the loss of wild <strong>ungulate</strong> populations and in some areas overgrazing by livestock (5).  In Europe the Egyptian vulture has been suffering severe long-term declines; the result of disturbance lead poisoning from gun shot direct poisoning and electrocution by powerlines as well as regulations introduced within the European Union to control the disposal of animal carcasses which have greatly reduced food availability for this scavenger.  In addition Avian pox has been cited as the cause of Egyptian vulture deaths in Bulgaria (5).  In India diclofenac an anti-inflammatory drug often used for livestock is likely to be the source of recent and extremely rapid declines in Egyptian vulture populations (5) (7).  This drug which is also responsible for devastating declines in other vulture species poisons vultures when they feed on the flesh of treated livestock (8).,Throughout its range the Egyptian vulture occurs in a number of protected areas as well as being the subject of monitoring supplementary feeding programmes and campaigns against the illegal use of poisons (5).  In 2006 manufacture of the veterinary form of the drug diclofenac was banned by the Indian Nepali and Pakistani governments (9) (10).  While this was a remarkable step forward in vulture conservation the drug remains widely available and the human form of the drug is sometimes being used to treat livestock instead (9).    Many more measures may be necessary if the long-term survival of the Egyptian vulture is to be assured.  BirdLife International recommends relaxing European Union regulations with regards to the disposal of animal carcasses lobbying for the ban of diclofenac throughout the species range and protecting nest sites as just some of the measures which would benefit the Egyptian vulture (5). ,loss; ,protected; ,1,1

Cotorra de El Oro; Perico de El Oro,Pyrrhura orcesi,El Oro parakeet (Pyrrhura orcesi),Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Psittaciformes,Psittacidae,Pyrrhura (1),Length: 22 cm (2),Deforestation associated with logging and clearance of trees for agriculture is a huge threat to the survival of the El Oro Parakeet. Although high altitude <strong>cloud forest</strong> is being deforested at a much slower rate this species is largely restricted to the more accessible lower altitude forest (2) (7). As habitat becomes more and more fragmented so the sub-populations are becoming more and more isolated and vulnerable. In 2006 the total population of El Oro parakeets was estimated to be less than 1000 birds (2).,In the past decade around 1500 hectares of forest has been acquired by the Jocotoco Foundation at Buenaventura the locality in which the El Oro parakeet was first discovered (2) (7) (8). Now known as the Buenaventura Reserve it is one of the richest ornithological regions of Ecuador and the only well protected site in which the El Oro parakeet occurs (7) (8). Approximately 80 El Oro parakeets are year-round occupants of the reserve but at certain times of the year the total number rises to around 120 (7) (9). The long-term aim is to expand the reserve to 5000 hectares and implement an environmental awareness campaign that will encourage and engage local people in conservation (2) (7) (8). , ,protected; ,0,1

Brow-antlered deer; thamin,Rucervus eldii,Eldâs deer (Rucervus eldii),Animalia,Chordata,Mammalia,Cetartiodactyla,Cervidae,Rucervus (1),up to 150 kg (2),Eld\xe2\x80\x99s deer are widely hunted as food and for their antlers (6). In particular Eld\xe2\x80\x99s deer are thought to have been hunted to feed the armies during many Asian wars (10). They are a prized game animal because of their impressive antlers and hides which are sold in the local markets (6). Habitat destruction due to expanding agriculture has also had a major impact on this rare species. In Manipur the Manipur brow-antlered deer (<i>R. e. eldii</i>) population has declined primarily due to wetland reclamation for grazing cultivation and fish farming (6). Very little suitable habitat is protected; only one percent of the protected forests in Southeast Asia are suitable for Eld\xe2\x80\x99s deer (11). Even within protected areas these threats continue. The Chatthin Wildlife Sanctuary Myanmar is one of the last strongholds of the species yet the <strong>dipterocarp</strong> forest within it continues to be degraded under great pressure from local communities for cropland and timber (7). Sadly there is often a lack of funding and political will for protection (12). Due to their highly fragmented distribution this species is also at risk from <strong>inbreeding</strong> and loss of genetic variation (12).,Eld\xe2\x80\x99s deer occur in a number of protected areas throughout its range. The entire Manipur brow-antlered deer (<i>R. e. eldii</i>) population now resides within Keibul Lamjao National Park Manipur (1) created in 1977 specifically to protect this <strong>subspecies</strong> (6). Additionally local projects have helped raise public awareness and support for conserving the deer (6). Hainan Datian Nature Reserve on Hainan Island China was established in 1976 specifically to help the Thailand brow-antlered deer (<i>R. e. siamensis</i>) <strong>subspecies</strong> recover with the population now growing an average of 15 percent annually (8). This population has become so large in fact that large numbers have been translocated to other parts of the island (8). Kyatthin and Shwesettaw Wildlife Sanctuaries were established in Myanmar to protect the Burmese brow-antlered deer (<i>R. e. thamin</i>) <strong>subspecies</strong> and a community education project was initiated in 1995 to raise local awareness about the plight of the deer and the protected status of the Kyatthin Wildlife Sanctuary (6). Captive populations exist around the world but <strong>inbreeding</strong> is common and cooperative <strong>cross-breeding</strong> is required if captive populations are to be genetically varied enough for any future reintroduction programmes into the wild (12). ,loss; ,protected; ,1,1
Sanghir sunbird,Aethopyga duyvenbodei,Elegant sunbird (Aethopyga duyvenbodei),Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Nectariniidae,Aethopyga (1),Length: 12 cm (2),When the tiny island of Sangihe was first colonised in the 17<sup>th </sup>century its forests were plundered for their natural resources of fruit spices and fibres. When these were gone the forests were replaced with plantations of bananas coconuts rubber and tea (7). After centuries of agriculture Sangihe has now been almost entirely stripped of forest and only tiny patches remain (6) (8). Naturally this has had a great impact on the island\xe2\x80\x99s wildlife including the elegant sunbird.,Action Sampiri a UK-based conservation group has been working to promote wildlife conservation on Sangihe since 1995 by conducting fieldwork running education and awareness programmes and developing ideas for future land-use that may be mutually beneficial to the local people and wildlife (2). The <strong>primary forest</strong> fragment at Mount Sahendaruman is nominally protected although action is limited (2) and forest in the Kentuhang valley also receives some protection as part of a <strong>watershed</strong> for a hydroelectric scheme (2). Improved effective protection of the forest at Mount Sahendaruman has been recommended (2) a measure that would not only help the elegant sunbird but also the other highly threatened species clinging to existence in this tiny patch of forest.\xa0 , ,protected; ,0,1

Furthermore the species\xe2\x80\x99 very small and restricted breeding range leaves it particularly vulnerable (2). The reasons for this decline are not fully understood but are believed to be associated with marine factors as predation on land during the breeding season is unlikely to be significant since there are no mammalian predators on the Bounty or Antipodes Islands except for mice on the main Antipodes Island (2) (7).,All the islands on which the erect-crested penguin is found are nature reserves and as of 1998 became part a World Heritage site. Cattle and sheep were eradicated from Campbell Island in 1984 and 1992 respectively and introduced brown rats (<i>Rattus norvegicus</i>) have also been successfully removed from Campbell Island (2). , , ,0,0

The vegetation in the Yavello Wildlife Sanctuary has been shown to have become much denser between 1986 and 2002 as a result of the enforcement of fire suppression and this is thought to be the cause of the decline in Ethiopian bush-crows. Partial clearance of scrub for cattle grazing space appears to have benefited the crow but intensive clearing of scrub for firewood and grazing is said to be having a negative impact elsewhere. The spread of cultivated land is also reducing suitable habitat (2).,A detailed study of the Ethiopian bush-crow\xe2\x80\x99s ecology and habitat requirements is currently underway and it is hoped that this might shed light on the effect of clearing <i>Acacia</i>. Yavello Sanctuary was created in order to protect this species and the white-tailed swallow (<i>Hirundo megaensis</i>) but there is no active management and the sanctuary has been deemed a failure. Responsibility for the area has now been transferred to the regional government and it is hoped that in collaboration with the local communities the sanctuary will become highly valuable and act as a stronghold for both of these important species (2). , , ,0,0
Abyssinian wolf; Simien fox; Simien jackal,Canis simensis,Ethiopian wolf (Canis simensis),Animalia,Chordata,Mammalia,Carnivora,Canidae,Canis (1),11 - 20 kg (2),The Ethiopian wolf has been reduced to a handful of mountain ranges due to pressures on the habitat particularly conversion to agriculture (2). As populations have become increasingly isolated by the fragmentation of their habitat the likelihood of local extinctions has increased. Rabies and distemper transmitted from domestic dogs to the wolves and <strong>hybridisation</strong> resulting from breeding with domestic dogs further threatens the survival of this species (4) (6).,Determined conservation efforts are needed in order to ensure the long-term survival of the remaining Ethiopian wolf populations. The Ethiopian Wolf Conservation Programme (EWCP) is a joint long-term project between the Wildlife Conservation Research Unit at Oxford University the Born Free Foundation and the Ethiopian Wildlife Conservation Organisation under the aegis of the IUCN Canid Specialist Group (4). The EWCP carries out vital conservation measures in the field working closely with local people and undertakes population monitoring and other needed research. Some of the activities undertaken so far in the Bale Mountains include assistance with park management in Bale vaccination and sterilisation of local dogs education programmes and tourism development (4) and the EWCP team has now expanded its activities to all wolf populations in the north of the country (7). ,fragmentation; , ,1,0

Evrotas dace,Squalius keadicus,European dace (Squalius keadicus),Animalia,Chordata,Actinopterygii,Cypriniformes,Cyprinidae,Squalius (1),Maximum length: 25 cm (2),Restricted to just a single river the European dace is primarily threatened by the loss of its habitat. Although the Evrotas River naturally dries up during periods of drought water extraction for agriculture has exacerbated this resulting in fish being stranded in stagnant pools of water with low oxygen concentration and high temperatures (1) (6). This was most severe in 2007 when a prolonged drought resulted in around 80 percent of the main river course drying up (6). As the European dace inhabits fast flowing cold waters mass fish mortality has been observed in areas where its habitat has been degraded in such a way (5). Fish communities within the Evrotas River have also suffered from pollution with lowland parts of the river often near urban areas being the most severely effected (1) (6).,The Evrotas River home to the European dace is a unique biodiversity hotspot within Greece. Its waters support many <strong>endemic</strong> species of plants and fish and consequently protecting this fragile environment is a key conservation priority (6). The importance of this river and a plan for its conservation is outlined in the EU Water Framework Directive. This requires habitat monitoring and management programmes to be implemented whilst tackling the threats to the river (6) (7). Furthermore establishing protected areas and developing sustainable water management plans will be crucial in preserving the European dace for the future (1) (2). ,loss;pollution; ,protected; ,2,1
Animalia,Tinostoma smaragditis,Fabulous green sphinx moth (Tinostoma smaragditis),Animalia,Arthropoda,Insecta,Lepidoptera,Sphingidae,Tinostoma (1),,The fabulous green sphinx moth resides on an island containing the highest diversity of threatened plants of all the Hawaiian Islands (1). The host plant of the fabulous green sphinx moth has not yet been identified but it is possible that it is as rare as the moth itself (1) (2). In 1992 Hurricane Iniki damaged large parts of forest on the moth\xe2\x80\x99s island and resulted in an increase in non-native invasive plant species which could have affected the host plant (1). The unknown host plant also faces destruction by <strong>feral</strong> animals such as pigs and goats which decimate native vegetation (1).,The fabulous green sphinx moth was thought to be extinct until astonishingly it was re-discovered in 1998 (1). It is now considered to be Endangered but unfortunately there are no protection measures in place to conserve it (1). Despite attempts to have it listed on the U.S. Endangered Species Act the lack of information about the fabulous green sphinx moth has so far prevented it from making the list (1). ,invasive; ,endangered species act; ,1,1

In the past overgrazing by sheep and other livestock has caused the Falklands rock cress to undergo a major decline\xa0and it now only exists in small localised patches. This limited distribution places it under additional threat from continued grazing agriculture human disturbance chance natural events genetic erosion and invasive species (1) (6) (7) (8).\xa0\xa0\xa0,Protected by law the Falklands rock cress is listed in the Conservation of Wildlife and Nature Ordinance by the Falkland Islands Government (4).

Faux Gavial Malais,Tomistoma schlegelii,False gharial (Tomistoma schlegelii),Animalia,Chordata,Reptilia,Crocodylia,Crocodylidae,Tomistoma (1),Male length: at least 5 m (2),Habitat destruction caused by the construction of dams channelling and deforestation amongst others has been the main cause of the decline of this species and continues to be its main threat to this day (3). Intensive hunting in some areas especially Sumatra in the mid 20th Century also contributed greatly to the decline in population numbers (3). Further threats come from fishing practices with false gharials either becoming caught in nets poisoned by toxins used to kill fish or else loosing their food source to local fishermen (2).,International trade in the false gharial is prevented by its listing on Appendix I of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) (1) and many of the known populations occur within protected areas (3). Recent population estimates of the false gharial are under 2500 mature adults but data on distribution is still insufficient (2). Before a successful conservation management plan can be implemented more information needs to be collected on the current status of this species in Malaysia and Indonesia. Further research into behaviour and ecology must be carried out in order to identify priority habitats and population needs (3). A Tomistoma Task Force has recently been set up under the umbrella of the IUCN-SSC Crocodile Specialist Group (5). ,hunting;fishing; ,cites;protected; ,2,2

Between 1935 and 1965 over 30000 individuals were killed every year (7). At present there is evidence of man-made injuries to fin whales many of which have resulted from collisions with boats (9). Like other large whales they are also threatened by environmental change including noise and chemical pollution (10).,In 1985 the International Whaling Commission (IWC) banned the hunting of all whales by signatory states. The IWC regulates the International Convention for the Regulation of Whaling (1946) and also provides scientific advice to signatory states (11). Conservationists are worried however that these protection measures are a case of 'too little too late' the southern hemisphere is thought to support only 5000 fin whales and the northern seas hold just 2 to 3000 individuals (4). It seems likely that the species may never recover from past over-exploitation. ,hunting;environmental;environment;pollution; , ,4,0

Felis viverrinus,Prionailurus viverrinus,Fishing cat (Prionailurus viverrinus),Animalia,Chordata,Mammalia,Carnivora,Felidae,Prionailurus (1),6 â 12 kg (2),The primary threat the fishing cat faces is wetland destruction with over 50 percent of Asian wetlands under threat and disappearing (4) (8) as a result of human settlement drainage for agriculture pollution excessive hunting and wood-cutting (1). Destructive fishing practices have also greatly reduced the fishing cat\xe2\x80\x99s main prey base. Additionally fishing cats are hunted for food medicine and body parts in some areas of their range and have been persecuted for taking domestic stock (1). The skin of the fishing cat has occasionally been observed in Asian markets although far less frequently than other cats (4).,The Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) lists the fishing cat on Appendix II under which permits are required for international traffic in this species (5). The fishing cat is also protected by national legislation over most of its range with the exception of Bhutan Malaysia and Vietnam (4). Legal protection is extremely difficult to enforce however and illegal poaching does take place (4) (5). In addition to enforcing protective legislation for this species it is crucial that there is protection of its wetland habitat. Habitat degradation has been the most significant contributor to the decline in numbers and this must be addressed if we are to maintain populations of this beautiful and extraordinary cat throughout its range across southern and southeast Asia. ,hunting;fishing;pollution; ,cites;protected; ,3,2

Stachyris speciosa,Dasycrotapha speciosa,Flame-templed babbler (Dasycrotapha speciosa),Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Timaliidae,Dasycrotapha (1),Length: 16 cm (2),Occupying one of the most degraded ecosystems in the whole of the Philippines relentless deforestation presents the most significant threat to the flame-templed babbler (2) (7) (8). In 1988 approximately four percent of Negros and eight percent of Panay remained forested and in the last 20 years the forest composition of both islands has almost certainly declined further. Given that only ten percent of the remaining forest occurs at a suitable altitude for this lowland bird it is no surprise that the flame-templed babbler is classified as Endangered on the IUCN Red List (2). While it is considered relatively tolerant of <strong>secondary growth</strong> the rate of clearance is so rapid that its ability to survive in degraded forests is more and more limited (2) (4).,While the flame-templed babbler occurs within existing and proposed national parks on both Negros and Panay there are no specific conservation measures in place for this species (2) (7). Further surveys and studies are required to establish the location of important sites and the capacity of the species to survive in degraded habitats. This will provide decision makers with information on where to position additional protected areas and how forests can be managed to halt the species\xe2\x80\x99 population decline (2). , ,protected; ,0,1

Habitats along rivers are often the first to be exploited and encroached upon by humans as settlements and agriculture expand (5). Perhaps an even greater threat to the species is water pollution particularly by oil organochlorines and heavy metals associated with agricultural run-off and logging activities contaminating the cat\xe2\x80\x99s prey (1).,The flat-headed cat is fully protected across most of its range with hunting and trade prohibited in Indonesia Malaysia Myanmar and Thailand and hunting regulated in Singapore (1) although no legal protection is afforded in Brunei Borneo (7). However if the species is adaptable and can survive in palm-oil plantations as reports suggest then it may be able to cope with considerable habitat disturbance and the future would not seem quite so bleak (2). ,pollution; ,protected; ,1,1

In 1992 only 15 percent of Florida scrubland remained (6). Many populations of the Florida perforate reindeer lichen are found on high-value real estate making their long-term survival unlikely without any protection (1). Land conversion to citrus plantations and residential development continues to diminish scrub habitat almost daily (2).\xa0,In 1993 the Florida perforate reindeer lichen earned the distinction of being the first lichen to be placed on the U.S. Endangered Species List (7). This means that all landowners of state land with populations of this species are responsible for its protection and conservation. Additionally the state of Florida has an active conservation program which monitors listed species such as the Florida perforate reindeer lichen and works to conserve them through land acquisition and management. Under this programme at least two sites at Lake Wales Ridge have been purchased for conservation purposes (1).\xa0 ,loss; ,protected; ,1,1

Animalia,Pardalotus quadragintus,Forty-spotted pardalote (Pardalotus quadragintus),Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Pardalotidae,Pardalotus (1),10 g (3),The decline in white gum woodlands and forests as a result of historical land clearance for agriculture forestry and urban development is chiefly responsible for the reduced number and highly fragmented populations that occur today (2) (3). Since European colonisation over 50 percent of white gum forest in the south east region of Tasmania has been cleared and on private land clearing still continues. The impact of woodland fragmentation on the forty-spotted pardalote is particularly damaging as the bird is not capable of long-distance dispersal and thus colonies quickly become isolated from each other (3). Wildfires which kill canopy trees and restrict regeneration of young trees pose an additional threat and it is feared that fires that swept through Flinders Island in 2002 may have severely damaged the remaining colonies found there (2) (3). Aside from habitat loss there is concern that aggressive birds such as the noisy miner (<i>Manorina melanocephala</i>) are invading forty-spotted pardalote habitat where it has been opened up by disturbance and clearance and subsequently are outcompeting this species for resources (3).,The preservation of white gum woodlands and forests is critical to the survival of the forty-spotted pardalote (3). Fortunately around 60 percent of the habitat currently occupied is protected within reserves including the most significant breeding colony on Bruny Island (2). A recovery plan which ran from 1991 to 1997 was instrumental in increasing the amount of protected habitat as well as in locating new colonies planting white gum seedlings to create new habitat and raising public awareness. The current stability of the forty-pardalote population at around 3800 birds in 2008 is evidence of the success of the original recovery plan but because it still has a very small and fragmented range the species remains classified as Endangered on the IUCN Red List (1) (2) (3). A new four-year recovery plan implemented in 2006 has the central aim of improving the conservation status of the forty-spotted pardalote sufficiently to warrant it being down-listed to Vulnerable. In order to achieve this the plan intends to enhance and expand existing habitat to assist in the colonisation of potential habitat and to conduct research that will help to identify and respond to threats restricting the current population (3). ,loss;fragmentation;pet; ,protected; ,3,1

It has also been extensively hunted for food and for use in traditional \xe2\x80\x9cmedicinal\xe2\x80\x9d preparations. Part of the range of Francois\xe2\x80\x99 langur was heavily bombed during the Vietnam War killing individuals as well as damaging and defoliating their habitat (2) (8).,The development and maintenance of reserves is crucial to the survival of this species and combating hunting through the implementation of a ranger system in areas of sanctuary would also be of value. Educating consumers of traditional \xe2\x80\x9cmedicines\xe2\x80\x9d derived from threatened species would not only impact positively on Francois\xe2\x80\x99 langur but on many other endangered species (8). Francois\xe2\x80\x99 langur is found in several protected areas in both Vietnam and China. Two of these the Sinh Long-Lung Nhoi Species and Habitat Conservation Area and Nam Xuan Lac Species and Habitat Conservation Area both in Vietnam were created especially for the protection of this threatened species (1). , ,protected; ,0,1

Animalia,Margaritifera margaritifera,Freshwater pearl mussel (Margaritifera margaritifera),Animalia,Mollusca,Bivalvia,Unionoida,Margaritiferidae,Margaritifera (1),Length: 12 â 15 cm (2),Once the most abundant <strong>bivalve mollusc</strong> in ancient rivers around the world numbers of the freshwater pearl mussel are now declining in all countries and this species is nearly extinct in many areas (4).  The causes of this decline are not fully understood but alteration and degradation of its freshwater habitat undoubtedly plays a central role (4).  The negative impacts humans have on rivers and streams come from a wide range of activities such as river regulation drainage sewage disposal dredging and water pollution including the introduction of excess nutrients (4).  Anything that affects the abundance of the fish hosts will also affect the freshwater pearl mussel; for example the introduction of exotic fish species such as the rainbow trout reduces the number of native fish hosts (4).  Introduced species are also directly affecting the freshwater pearl mussel; the invasion of the zebra mussel (<i>Dreissena polymorpha</i>) which has been spread to new locations by being transported on the bottom of boats or in ballast waters has impacted freshwater pearl mussel populations in all countries it has invaded (4).,The freshwater pearl mussel which is completely protected in most European countries (8) has been the focus of a significant amount of conservation efforts (9).  Measures have included the transfer of adult mussels to areas where it had gone extinct (9) (10) the culture of juvenile mussels and the release of juvenile trout which have been infected with glochidia into small rivers (10) but mainly the freshwater pearl mussel has benefited from habitat restoration projects in some areas (10).  Due to the essential role salmonid fish play in the life of the freshwater pearl mussel the conservation of salmon and trout is also central in the survival of this endangered freshwater mussel (4). ,pollution; ,protected; ,1,1
Animalia,Austropotamobius pallipes,Freshwater white-clawed crayfish (Austropotamobius pallipes),Animalia,Arthropoda,Crustacea,Decapoda,Astacidae,Austropotamobius (1),Length: up to 12 cm (usually less than 10 cm) (2),Perhaps the most devastating factor affecting freshwater white-clawed crayfish at present is crayfish plague a virulent fungal disease carried by the aggressive introduced species the American signal crayfish (<i>Pacifastacus leniusculus</i>) (4). Spores of this disease can be spread in the water on wet equipment and on fish (2). Competition with introduced crayfish species has also affected our native crayfish (3); signal crayfish were first introduced to the UK in the 1970s and are now naturalised and breeding (2). Two other introduced species have become established (3); the narrow-clawed (or Turkish) crayfish (<i>Astacus leptodactylus</i>) and the noble crayfish (<i>Astacus astacus</i>) (2). Pollution and river works are also likely to have affected the species (2).,The freshwater white-clawed crayfish has been targeted as a priority for conservation under the UK Biodiversity Action Plan (UK BAP). The Species Action Plan aims to maintain the current distribution of the species through a combination of restricting the spread of non-native crayfish and crayfish plague as well as providing suitable habitat features (3). The Environment Agency has carried out research into potential methods of controlling the signal crayfish and is currently investigating the use of pheromones to lure this introduced species into traps (5). It is an offence under Schedule 9 of the Wildlife and Countryside Act to release the three introduced species of crayfish into the wild (3). ,disease;pet;pollution; , ,3,0

Akalat de Gabela,Sheppardia gabela,Gabela akalat (Sheppardia gabela),Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Muscicapidae,Sheppardia (1),Length: 13 cm (2),Prior to 1974 large areas of forest in Angola were lost to the establishment of coffee plantations but with the start of the civil war many of the plantations around the Gabela district were abandoned and the forest understorey recovered significantly.  With the cessation of hostilities in 2002 pressure on the forest will again increase as demand for agricultural land grows (4).  A growth in subsistence agriculture now poses the greatest threat to the Gabela akalat and other forest-dwelling birds of the region (2) (4).  In some areas 20 to 70 percent of canopy trees and all the undergrowth in valley bottoms are being cleared to plant bananas and sweet potatoes.  In other areas up to 95 percent of the forest canopy is being removed to plant cassava and maize (2).  In addition the re-establishment of coffee plantations would also have serious impacts on the Gabela akalat particularly if varieties that require shade (which thrive beneath the canopy of forests) were replaced by sun-tolerant varieties (which results in the destruction of the forest canopy) (4).,For the duration of the protracted civil war very little scientific research was undertaken in Angola.  Since the war was formally ended in 2002 surveys to determine the Gabela akalat\xe2\x80\x99s population size and distribution could now be carried out (2).  Ascertaining the call of this shy bird would be extremely useful in any future surveys that are undertaken; in 2004 a group of scientists first recorded a call emanating from the location of a Gabela akalat but more work is needed to confirm its repertoire (4).  The bird conservation organisation BirdLife International also recommends that the forest at Gabela should be designated as a protected area (2). , ,protected; ,0,1
Gabela bushshrike; Gabela bush-shrike,Laniarius amboimensis,Gabela bush shrike (Laniarius amboimensis),Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Malaconotidae,Laniarius (1),Length: 20 cm (2),Most of the forest the Gabela bush-shrike inhabits was selectively logged before the 27-year-long Angolan civil war started in 1975 and although there is no evidence of ongoing logging the forest continues to be a source of firewood for local people and is cleared to make way for subsistence agriculture (2) (4) (7). In some parts of its habitat 20 to 70 percent of canopy trees and all the undergrowth in valley bottoms is being cleared to plant bananas and sweet potatoes. In other areas up to 95 percent of the forest canopy is being removed to plant cassava and maize (8). While the Gabela bush-shrike is said to be fairly tolerant of degraded habitats (4) (7) numbers of this species are still believed to have declined over recent years (2).,The protection of a 50 square kilometre area inhabited by the Gabela bush-shrike was recommended in the early 1970s (8) as it is home to several endangered birds (4) but this has not yet been established (8). The creation of a protected area to ensure the survival of the Gabela bush-shrike remains a priority and a number of other conservation measures have also been recommended. These include conducting surveys to determine the Gabela bush-shrike\xe2\x80\x99s distribution and population size and studies to determine the species\xe2\x80\x99 habitat requirements. To address the issue of land-use change for farming ecotourism has been suggested as a viable addition to agriculture (2). , ,protected; ,0,1
Bagadais de Gabela,Prionops gabela,Gabela helmet-shrike (Prionops gabela),Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Malaconotidae,Prionops (1),Length: 19 cm (2),Due to the restricted range of the Gabela helmet-shrike the destruction of its habitat poses the greatest threat to this species (4). Charcoal production is claiming large tracts of dry forest near the escarpment while other areas are being cleared to plant subsistence agricultural crops such as bananas sweet potato maize and cassava. In addition now that conflict has ended on the escarpment large-scale coffee planting and farming is now likely to resume claiming more of this imperilled bird\xe2\x80\x99s habitat (2).,The Gabela helmet-shrike is found in the Kissama National Park which affords a degree of protection against habitat destruction (2). Unfortunately however a proposal to create another protected area the Gabela Nature Reserve which would have helped to protect this species against the resumption of commercial activities on the escarpment has not materialised (2) (5). In order to ensure this species\xe2\x80\x99 survival surveys of its population and habitat should be conducted along with research into its ecology. In addition a conservation strategy for the Angolan escarpment and surrounding areas should be implemented including the promotion of ecotourism and a supplement to agriculture (2). , ,protected; ,0,1

By the early 20th century the Galapagos fur seal was believed to be extinct until a small colony was discovered in 1932-33 (8). Since then and following the end of extensive seal hunting (3) numbers have increased substantially (8) and the Galapagos fur seal is no longer exploited (2).,The Galapagos fur seal is fully protected by the Galapagos National Park Service under Ecuadorean law (2). It will also benefit from the management of the Galapagos Islands and the surrounding waters as a national park and marine reserve (5) (10). As one of the first sites to be designated a Natural World Heritage Site (10) the recognition of the Galapagos\xe2\x80\x99 incredible and unique ecosystem will hopefully ensure the preservation of the islands\xe2\x80\x99 fauna and flora for generations to come. ,hunting; ,protected; ,1,1

Animalia,Bulimulus nux,Galapagos land snail (Bulimulus nux),Animalia,Mollusca,Gastropoda,Stylommatophora,Bulimulidae,Bulimulus (1),,Since their colonisation the Galapagos Islands have experienced a dramatic decline of suitable habitat for land snails as farming road and house construction and eventually tourism grew (1) (2) (3). Both San Crist\xc3\xb3bal and Floreana have been badly affected and each now has more than five bulimulid species categorized as Critically Endangered or Endangered on the IUCN Red List as well as several previously recorded species that are now extinct (3). Grazing livestock (goats pigs) and invasive alien plants have also altered the snail\xe2\x80\x99s habitat (3) and occasionally the islands have suffered from uncontrolled fires destroying habitat and snails alike (2). Additionally introduced predators such as black rats (<i>Rattus rattus</i>) and little fire ants (<i>Wasmania auropunctata</i>) have had a direct impact on land snail populations by feeding on them and destroying their eggs (2). Established populations of the invasive little fire ant are known to exist on San Crist\xc3\xb3bal and Floreana (1).,There are currently no conservation measures targeting this species. ,invasive; , ,1,0

Southern martin,Progne modesta,Galapagos martin (Progne modesta),Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Hirundinidae,Progne (1),Size: 15 cm (2),With a dangerously small population thought to total fewer than 1000 individuals and possibly fewer than 600 the Galapagos martin faces an uncertain future. Furthermore no more than 50 birds have been recorded at any one site. The population is likely to have declined over the last 200 years probably as a result of introduced diseases parasites and nest predators (e.g. rats <i>Rattus</i>) but current population trends and threats are unknown (3).,There are currently no known conservation measures underway to protect this bird. Due to a lack of data there is an urgent need for surveys throughout its range to determine accurate population estimates and trends. Research into the reasons for the bird\xe2\x80\x99s small population and possible decline is also needed. The information gained from such studies could help guide appropriate conservation measures in the future and hopefully help secure for this rare native bird a more certain and prosperous future (3). ,disease; , ,1,0
Animalia,Spheniscus mendiculus,Galapagos penguin (Spheniscus mendiculus),Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Sphenisciformes,Spheniscidae,Spheniscus (1),Length: 53 cm (2),The main threat facing this unique penguin is the increasing frequency of ENSO events which reduce the strength of the cool currents this species needs to survive and causes fluctuations in its prey (6). The 1982-1983 ENSO resulted in the catastrophic loss of 77 percent of the Galapagos penguin population through starvation. A slow period of recovery followed but the 1997-1998 ENSO resulted in another precipitous population crash of 66 percent. Such events may have a disproportionate affect on females which can skew the sex ratio and make recovery from population crashes even slower (2). Furthermore during periods of food shortages the Galapagos penguin forages individually and makes no attempt to breed until sea temperatures decrease once again (4).\xa0,All populations of the Galapagos penguin occur within the Galapagos National Park and Marine Reserve. At present all populations are closely monitored and feral animals are controlled (2).\xa0 ,loss; , ,1,0

In the 19th century sea-lions worldwide were hunted for their meat skin and oil. The hunting of some sea-lions including the Galapagos species has now been banned and populations have recovered (2). Galapagos sea lions are still vulnerable to human activity as their inquisitive and social nature means they are more likely to approach areas inhabited by humans. This brings them into contact with fishing nets hooks and human waste all of which can be fatal (6). There are also problems resulting from the increase in numbers of deep-water tuna and billfish fisheries as these sea-lions become victims of <strong>bycatch</strong> (7). Research indicates that the majority of these incidents (67 percent) involve juveniles probably due to their more curious and playful nature (7).,The Galapagos sea lion occurs in one of the most biologically diverse areas of the world. The Galapagos Islands have long been studied and protected and were influential in the formulation of Darwin\xe2\x80\x99s theory of evolution by natural selection. Most recently in March 1998 a 133000 square kilometres area was designated as the Galapagos Marine Reserve making it one of the world\xe2\x80\x99s largest protected areas. Detailed conservation and research programmes have been developed which focus on studying the islands\xe2\x80\x99 ecology the effects of environmental fluctuations on species and the effects of humans on wildlife. These measures have to some extent protected this sea lion especially from hunting. The Charles Darwin Research Centre has implemented an ecological monitoring project of the Galapagos sea-lion to determine the state and abundance of the sea lions. This project also studies the ongoing threats to this mammal and has developed simple rescue methods for injured or caught sea lions. Elsewhere in the world sea lions are suffering dramatic population declines for unknown reasons and so conservation measures like these which both monitor and protect the sea lion are invaluable in the future of the Galapagos sea lion (7). ,hunting;fishing;disease; ,protected; ,3,1

A major threat to the Ganges river dolphin has been the extensive damming of rivers for irrigation and electricity generation which isolates populations and prevents seasonal migration (7). Other threats include chemical pollution boat traffic hunting and human disturbance. This species is hunted for oil fish bait and food by local people; accidental entanglement in fishing nets also occurs (5).,International trade is prohibited by the listing of the Ganges river dolphin on Appendix I of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) (3). It is also listed in the Agreement on the Conservation of Small <strong>Cetaceans</strong> of the Baltic and North Sea (ASCOBANS) under the auspices of the CMS (8). It is protected under the Indian Wildlife Act although these legislations require stricter enforcement (5). Proposed conservation measures include designated dolphin sanctuaries and the creation of additional habitat. Further research into the current distribution and abundance of this elusive river-dweller is urgently required in order to implement effective conservation measures (5). ,hunting;fishing;pollution; ,cites;protected; ,3,2

Females with offspring are frequently targeted so that the babies may be sold into the pet trade. It has been reported that three hunters in the Western Amazon killed over 200 woolly monkeys in a little less than two years resulting in their local extinction (11) illustrating the devastating effect that hunting may have on this species. Deforestation is also a serious problem for Geoffroy\xe2\x80\x99s woolly monkey (1); forest is cleared to make way for agricultural land and in the south of its range as a result of mining for cassiterite (a mineral that is the chief source of tin) (11).\xa0,Luckily many of the areas in which Geoffroy\xe2\x80\x99s woolly monkey occurs are now protected within National Parks. In Bolivia the entire known range of the Geoffroy\xe2\x80\x99s woolly monkey is contained within two protected areas (1).

This habitat loss has been the result of indiscriminate urban and agricultural development and unfortunately the geometric tortoise has proved to be intolerant of habitat modification (4) (12).  The <strong>fynbos biome</strong> and <strong>renosterveld</strong> vegetation is adapted to fire but too frequent unplanned and uncontrolled fires can result in local extinction of the geometric tortoise (4) (8).  In addition the spread of invasive alien vegetation in the region competes with and excludes important food items (8).  The geometric tortoise is occasionally eaten by farm workers and in the past it has been much sought after for the pet trade.  However the impact of these activities is negligible compared to the major threat of habitat degradation and destruction (4).,The geometric tortoise is protected by Western Cape Provincial legislation which is rigidly and effectively enforced (4) and it is listed on Appendix I of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) meaning that trade in this species is only permitted in exceptional circumstances (3).  In addition around 75 percent of the total population exists in formal protected areas (4) such as the Elandsberg Private Nature Reserve and a number of smaller provincial reserves (8).  However the majority of remaining geometric tortoise habitat is in the hands of private landowners and efforts are being made to secure the future of some of these sites through a conservation stewardship programme (13).  Captive breeding of the geometric tortoise has had limited success and is currently not considered a priority thus the primary focus of conservation efforts is to ensure its continued survival in the wild (4).  The continued enforcement of conservation legislation and vigilance towards the unscrupulous collection of animals for the pet trade is called for (2) while the maintenance of protected areas is essential.  In addition it is imperative that private landowners take custodianship of the last remaining <strong>renosterveld</strong> remnants that contain geometric tortoise populations in partnership with conservation agencies since it is practically not possible to buy enough land to protect formally (2).  Without such measures the <strong>renosterveld</strong> habitat and its endangered inhabitants may disappear completely. ,loss;invasive;pet; ,cites;captive breeding;protected; ,3,3

Some giant bushy-tailed cloud rats have also been captured to be kept as pets. The deterioration and loss of forest habitat may also be threatening this species (5) as commercial agriculture population growth and poverty in the Philippines forces people to clear forest for cultivation at increasingly high altitudes (9).,The giant bushy-tailed cloud rat occurs in several national parks in northern Luzon (8) including Mount Pulag National Park (3).

A decline in habitat quality particularly in the Mediterranean is also likely to be impacting populations of giant devilray though to what extent is not known (1). Its preference for inhabiting the surface of the oceans makes the giant devilray vulnerable to disturbance from maritime traffic and oil spills (1).,In 2005 the General Fisheries Commission for the Mediterranean adopted a measure to ban trawling below 1000 metres and banned driftnets throughout the Mediterranean (6). This is likely to have substantially reduced the threat of <strong>by-catch</strong> to the giant devilray in the Mediterranean. Raising awareness with fishermen to maximise the number of giant devilrays that are disentangled and released unharmed after accidental capture has also been recommended as an important measure to protect this magnificent oceanic animal (1). , , ,0,0

Habitat loss is also a threat as a result of increasing agricultural expansion forestry operations and changes in water quality (3). In-stream barriers have reduced the dispersal potential of the crayfish and erosion following agricultural expansion has caused silty water which is less favourable for the giant freshwater crayfish (4).,The decline of giant freshwater crayfish numbers following intense resulted in a fishing ban in January 1998 although an ongoing commitment is needed in order for the crayfish to recover from its endangered status. Population surveys and behavioural research are being undertaken in order to be able to provide better habitat protection and improved management of riverbank vegetation (3). ,loss;fishing; , ,2,0

The fact that it requires such a specific habitat has left it vulnerable to human-inflicted habitat degradation and fragmentation. Commercial forestry plantations have replaced large areas of <strong>indigenous</strong> forest and firewood collection bark stripping the cutting of saplings for hut construction and overgrazing by livestock have also caused a dramatic reduction in available habitat (5).,The fate of the giant golden mole remains uncertain as although it may occur in a few protected reserves there are currently no targeted conservation actions underway to protect this species.

The resistant nature of the wood made it a favourable timber and it was used to make a wide variety of items from fence posts to patio furniture (2). Roughly 34 percent of the original range of the giant sequoia was lost to timber extraction (4). Ironically a further threat to sequoia groves came from fire prevention strategies imposed by forest managers; this strategy prevented sequoias from regenerating successfully whist allowing competitor species to proliferate (4).,The giant sequoia is now recognised as a national treasure and as much as 90 percent of the population is protected (1). The best-known groves are found in Yosemite Sequoia and Kings Canyon National Parks (3); attracting tourists from far and wide to view these magnificent trees. The National Parks Service now practices controlled burning as part of its management strategy although further research is needed into the natural cycle of disturbance in order to better understand these processes (4).

The habitat of the golden lion tamarin has therefore been drastically reduced and fragmented into isolated patches. A former threat to the species in the wild came from the collection of live individuals for private collections and zoos (6) but this practice became illegal in the 1970s and subsequently decreased (5). Occasionally specimens will still turn up in a local market (5) but the pet trade now has relatively little impact on numbers (2). Further more captive breeding in zoos and subsequent <strong>re-introductions</strong> have literally helped save this species from extinction so its former collection for zoos has also had a very positive impact (2).,Fortunately the golden lion tamarin has been the subject of a large-scale determined conservation effort. A captive breeding programme aims to maintain a zoo population of 500 individuals and since 1984 captive-bred individuals have been re-introduced to the wild (6) (10). Furthermore released individuals have successfully reared young in the wild (6). A huge conservation education programme in Brazil has raised the profile of the golden lion tamarin and the species is now widely regarded with pride as a national symbol of conservation (10). In 1980 the wild population had reached an all time low of less than 100 individuals (11) but by 2000 this had increased to 1000 424 of which were re-introduced from captive stock (12). Despite these efforts the species still requires protection and continued conservation efforts if it is to evade extinction. (5). ,pet; ,captive breeding; ,1,1
Golden conure; Queen of Bavaria conure,Guaruba guarouba,Golden parakeet (Guaruba guarouba),Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Psittaciformes,Psittacidae,Guaruba (1),Length: 34 cm (2),Although the golden parakeet has probably always been relatively scarce its numbers have been declining for some time. At the turn of the millennium just 1000 to 2500 golden parakeets were estimated to be remaining in the wild (2). Undoubtedly deforestation and rampant exploitation for the caged-bird trade are chiefly responsible for its precarious status (2) (5). Road construction development and logging have depleted and fragmented large areas of biologically rich rainforests which the golden parakeet utilises for nesting roosting and foraging (2) (4). At the same time with high demand for this species in the caged-bird trade illegal trapping continues apace (10). Sadly it is also hunted for food feathers and sport and to reduce damage to crops (2).,The golden parakeet is protected by Brazilian law and since 1973 has been listed under Appendix I of the Convention on International in Endangered Species (CITES) which permits trade in this species only under exceptional circumstances (2) (3). Unfortunately the human and financial resources available to prevent wildlife exploitation are limited and consequently illegal trapping remains prolific and many birds continue to be smuggled out of Brazil (6) (10). There is a population of golden parakeet in the fairly well protected Tapaj\xc3\xb3s National Park but reserves can be limited in their effectiveness because of this species\xe2\x80\x99 nomadic behaviour (2). There is cause for optimism however as in 2001 the Golden Conure Survival Fund was established (4) (8). This has been instrumental in raising significant funds to support much needed research into the species\xe2\x80\x99 population and threats. Furthermore it is anticipated that future funds will be used to help implement direct conservation initiatives such as land purchase education of local people and law enforcement (8) (9) (10). , ,cites;protected; ,0,2

As a result of deforestation and hunting populations all over the Philippines have declined considerably and this species has vanished entirely from a number of islands (5).  The natural habitat of the Philippines is amongst the most threatened in the world with only six to seven percent of the original <strong>primary forest</strong> remaining largely due to extensive commercial logging (8).  This undoubtedly has had a significant impact on the golden-capped fruit bat which favours <strong>primary forest</strong> (5).,While the golden-capped fruit bat is thought to occur in some protected areas (5) further action is urgently needed to prevent the extinction of this species.  In 1992 an action plan developed for the conservation of Old World fruit bats outlined a number of conservation measures recommended for this species.  Due to the problems with enforcing any hunting controls the plan recommended that the most effective method of protection would be to manage colonies on small islands where suitable habitat remains and where protection efforts would have a better chance of success (5).  In 2003 the Philippine Endemic Species Conservation Project implemented a programme for the protection of the golden-capped fruit bat on the tiny island of Boracay off the northwest corner of Panay.  The project\xe2\x80\x99s achievements included nearly eliminating hunting of the colony (9).  In combination with conservation efforts in the wild captive breeding may eventually be necessary to ensure the long-term survival of the golden-capped fruit bat (5). ,hunting; ,captive breeding;protected; ,1,2
Animalia,Dendroica chrysoparia,Golden-cheeked warbler (Dendroica chrysoparia),Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Parulidae,Dendroica (1),7 - 15 g (2),The main threat to the golden-cheeked warbler is habitat loss with much of its breeding habitat having been cleared for development agriculture and reservoir construction (2) (3) (4) (6) (8) and the winter habitat also under threat from logging burning firewood-cutting mineral extraction and clearance for cattle and agriculture (2) (4) (8) (9) (10). The species\xe2\x80\x99 rather restricted habitat requirements and small breeding range make it particularly vulnerable to habitat loss (4) (10) and ongoing fragmentation of the remaining habitat also creates further problems by isolating populations and so reducing <strong>gene flow</strong> between them potentially leading to a loss of genetic diversity. It also decreases nesting success at forest edges and potentially increases predation as well as <strong>brood parasitism</strong> by the brown-headed cowbird (<i>Molothrus ater</i>) (2) (3) (4) (6). In addition habitat disturbance may decrease juniper-oak regeneration through disease and increased browsing pressure and the woodlands may take decades to recover from disturbance if at all (2) (7). Where juniper has instead spread often due to fire suppression and overgrazing it generally lacks the hardwood trees that the golden-cheeked warbler also requires (6).,In 1990 the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service listed the golden-cheeked warbler as Endangered (5) and the species is also listed as Endangered by the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department (12). A recovery plan put in place in the United States in 1992 called for the protection of sufficient breeding and non-breeding habitat the allowance of <strong>gene flow</strong> between warbler populations and the protection and management of all existing populations on public land (8). The golden-cheeked warbler occurs in a number of protected areas throughout its range including Balcones Canyonlands National Wildlife Refuge in Texas and various conservation efforts including habitat restoration and voluntary cowbird trapping are underway in many areas (2) (3) (4) (6) (8).\xa0 ,loss;fragmentation;disease; ,protected; ,3,1
Tattersall's sifaka,Propithecus tattersalli,Golden-crowned sifaka (Propithecus tattersalli),Animalia,Chordata,Mammalia,Primates,Indriidae,Propithecus (1),3.5 kg (2),Of all lemurs the golden-crowned sifaka has one of the most limited distributions (3). Vast tracts of their habitat have been cleared and the isolated patches of forest that remain are under pressure from logging and bush fires (2). The species is also hunted in some areas (2) and the recent discovery of gold in the region has resulted in an influx of miners causing further habitat loss and the hunting of lemurs for food (4).,Recent studies have shown that these sifakas are fairly abundant in some of the remaining forest fragments within their range and estimates put the population at between 6200 and 10000 individuals (7). Based on these figures it has been suggested that the World Conservation Union (IUCN) should reclassify the species as Endangered (7). At present the captive population of golden-crowned sifakas numbers just three at the Duke University Primate Centre (4). The species does not currently occur within a protected area (2) but is listed under Class A of the African Convention on the Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources whereby hunting killing capture or collection of individuals is forbidden unless for scientific purposes and with permission (6). A network of protected areas has been proposed to conserve the remaining forest fragments in which the golden-crowned sifaka is found (7). ,loss;hunting; ,protected; ,2,1
Gold and black lion tamarind,Leontopithecus chrysomelas,Golden-headed lion tamarin (Leontopithecus chrysomelas),Animalia,Chordata,Mammalia,Primates,Callitrichidae,Leontopithecus (1),480 â 700 g (2),Golden-headed lion tamarins are among the world\xe2\x80\x99s most critically endangered mammals (8). Their habitat is one of the first to be cleared because they live in lowland forests. Currently only 2-5% of its original habitat remains (3) the rest being removed for timber or charcoal and to make way for plantations cattle pasture and industry (7). Eastern and South-eastern Brazil was also one of the first areas to be colonised almost 500 years ago and is now one of the most densely inhabited areas in Brazil exerting huge pressures on the land\xe2\x80\x99s resources (5) (8). Critically low numbers in the wild are due almost exclusively to habitat loss (2). This primate also suffers losses because of natural predators such as ocelots snakes hawks and eagles. In addition this species has suffered from trade as its amazing appearance makes it a prize pet and very popular in zoos (7) (9). However captive breeding in zoos and subsequent reintroductions have also helped save this species from extinction so its former collection for zoos has also had a very positive impact (2). Since it has been listed as Endangered by the IUCN and hunting and trade of the species has been banned (1) (4) it is hoped that hunting no longer poses a threat though sadly there are still occasional reports of illegal trade in this species (7). Deforestation and habitat loss however are more difficult problems to solve (6).,In the 1970s the numbers of these monkeys in zoos were declining as fast as those in the wild (5) (7). At this time researchers from the National Zoological Park in Washington DC developed techniques for successfully breeding this species in captivity and created a conservation plan to implement genetic and demographic management of the captive population involving long term studies of the species educating local communities about conservation efforts and increasing the extent of protected habitats (5). ,loss;hunting;pet; ,captive breeding;protected; ,3,2

ant-bed parrot; golden-winged parrot,Psephotus chrysopterygius,Golden-shouldered parrot (Psephotus chrysopterygius),Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Psittaciformes,Psittacidae,Psephotus (1),54 â 56 g (3),The golden-shouldered parrot has a small restricted and decreasing range (2) suffering principally from predation possibly in combination with a shortage of food in the early wet season. (8). Both threats have come about as a result of a change in fire regime in combination with cattle grazing (8). Fire is a feature of their natural environment and the parrots are a fire-dependent species with fire maintaining their habitat and the availability of essential foods (9). A lack of burning or burning at the wrong time of year in association with cattle grazing which has reduced fuel loads has resulted in the invasion of woodland throughout the species\xe2\x80\x99 former range. The increase in woody vegetation is thought to have favoured predators such as the pied butcherbird (<i>Cracticus nigrogularis</i>). Predation of adults is a major cause of nest failure with almost one third of nests losing one or more adults (2). The shortage of food that occurs annually during the wet season may be made worse by the lack of early wet season burning and selective grazing by introduced cattle of early-seeding perennial grasses (7) (5). In addition feral pigs preferentially eat the same important grass species and reduce recruitment of the termite mounds used for nesting (7). Intensive conservation efforts have stemmed the long-term decline of the golden-shouldered parrot in closely monitored sites but in less well-monitored sites the population is probably still declining (1) (7).,Golden-shouldered parrots have been studied in detail for over 16 years and during this time land and fire management have been adjusted across much of its range to suit the parrot\xe2\x80\x99s ecological requirements (9). Over these years completed or current management actions include analysis of threats changing fire regimes vegetation change annual monitoring and supplementary feeding of the Artemis Station population and surveys of populations and nests in the remainder of the bird\xe2\x80\x99s range. Other actions include fencing and implementation of favourable fire regimes on leasehold land and National Parks signing of a conservation agreement with land-holders and inclusion of conservation requirements for the species in property planning in central Cape York Peninsula (2). As a result of these measures the bird\xe2\x80\x99s range which contracted greatly between 1992 and 1998 may now have stabilized (9). A small proportion of the parrot\xe2\x80\x99s range occurs inside the Staaten River National Park and reintroductions into Mungkan Kandju National Park are also planned (9). It has been advocated that future conservation efforts focus on providing supplementary food during the wet-season developing and refining a pastoral management strategy and securing land under conservation agreements (2). It has been estimated that around 1500 golden-shouldered parrots are held in captivity in Australia (3) with considerable numbers bred in captivity each season (6). A sustainable future for this bird in captivity is therefore safeguarded ensuring that this beautiful parrot is with us for a long time to come (6). The bird\xe2\x80\x99s prospects in the wild however currently appear somewhat bleaker despite considerable conservation efforts and successes and far more needs to be done if this enchanting bird is to be saved in its natural habitat where it belongs. ,environment; , ,1,0

The construction of dams also threatens the breeding habitat of these frogs and this species is particularly vulnerable to habitat alteration due to its highly restricted range (2). Additionally goliath frogs are considered a delicacy and are collected by local people for food (3); their large size has also encouraged collection for the pet trade in the past (2).,The goliath frog is not currently protected under any trade restrictions and collection continues to threaten remaining populations.

Hunted for its meat this species appears to be extremely vulnerable to poaching having rapidly disappeared from areas of intensive hunting even by surprisingly small human populations (6). Dwindling habitat is also a major cause for concern with forest having been destroyed due to logging mining oil exploration and agriculture. Lowland rainforest has undergone extensive clearance and those populations still surviving in highland forest have been fragmented and isolated markedly limiting their opportunity for out-breeding (3).,Its occurrence in a reasonable number of National Parks and reserves has helped ensure the survival of Goodfellow\xe2\x80\x99s tree kangaroo as has the almost complete lack of any large tree-climbing predators or competitors (3).

Gorgeted wood quail,Odontophorus strophium,Gorgeted wood-quail (Odontophorus strophium),Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Galliformes,Odontophoridae,Odontophorus (1),ca. 302 g (2),In 2008 the gorgeted wood-quail was downlisted by the IUCN from Critically Endangered to Endangered after surveys found it to be more widespread than previously thought (3). However the species is still under serious threat from hunting and habitat loss with most of its habitat having already been converted to agriculture plantations and grazing land and the remaining forest reduced to tiny isolated patches (2) (3) (6) (7). The highly restricted and fragmented range of the gorgeted wood-quail encompassing an area no more than 280 kilometres in length together with its small population size makes it particularly vulnerable to any threats (2) (3). As a ground-dwelling species it may also have a limited ability to disperse (5) making a lack of habitat connectivity particularly detrimental to its survival.,The gorgeted wood-quail receives some protection within the Guanent\xc3\xa1-Alto R\xc3\xado Fonce Flora and Fauna Sanctuary and the adjacent Cachalu Biological Reserve and efforts have been underway to set up research projects in these areas (2) (3) (6) (7).

Any remaining natural forest is highly fragmented. However the forests on the slope of Mount Karthala are not very suitable for agriculture and therefore may be spared this fate (5). Introduced species may also pose a threat; rats are known to be abundant within forests on Grand Comoro Island and may predate the nests of the drongo (2). As the Grand Comoro drongo is found only surrounding an active volcano a volcanic eruption could potentially have devastating consequences for this bird.,A protected area has been proposed for Mount Karthala but this has not yet been established (5).

The seeds and the vitamin C-rich fruit pulp are eaten fresh and cooking oil is extracted from the oil-rich seeds.  The fruit is either collected from the ground or wooden pegs are hammered into the trunk so the tree can be climbed to collect the fruit (2).  The thick bark of the baobab is composed of tough long fibres that can be used to make ropes and the majority of trees bear scars from where the bark was cut from ground level to about two meters to obtain this material (2).  The spongy wood is comprised of sheets of fibre that are collected from dead or living trees dried in the sun and sold for thatch (2).  Most of these varied uses do not involve the tree being killed and thus are unlikely to pose a great threat to the baobab.  The greatest threat to this species has come from the transformation of its forest habitat into agricultural land.  Within these disturbed habitats there is a noticeable lack of young trees.  Fires seed predation competition from weeds and an altered physical environment might be affecting the ability of the Madagacar baobab to reproduce (2) which may have devastating consequences for its survival.,Numerous non-governmental organisations and scientists along with the Malagasy government realise the importance of conserving the unique biodiversity of Madagascar and are working to protect this magnificent island and its diverse fauna and flora (4).  One measure from which Grandidier\xe2\x80\x99s baobab is likely to benefit is the designation of protected areas.  In 2003 the President of Madagascar vowed to triple the amount of protected areas (5); a pledge that won\xe2\x80\x99t only help the magnificent giant baobab but also the Malagasy people whose livelihoods depend on the preservation of their watersheds and forests. ,environment;pet; ,protected; ,2,1

In Egypt suitable habitat is declining in both area and quality and this is also presumed to be the case in Libya. The rarity of the grass-loving lizard is also making it more attractive to animal collectors and declines in its population can be partly attributed to collection for the pet trade as well as for scientific research (1) (2).,The grass-loving lizard does not currently occur in any protected areas so there is an urgent need to protect its habitat and to develop community-based protection measures (1) (2). An estimated one to five square kilometres of suitable habitat has been identified in Egypt suggesting that there is hope for conservation efforts to protect the habitat there.

The largest population occurs in Rugezi swamp Rwanda (3); an area which is being degraded and encroached by agriculture (2).  Many smaller swamp sites particularly those near dense human settlements are also being drained for cultivation or pasture (2) (3).,Several of the swamps which Grauer\xe2\x80\x99s scrub-warblers inhabit are protected within national parks such Bwindi-Impenetrable Forest National Park Uganda and Kahuzi-Bi\xc3\xa9ga National Park Democratic Republic of Congo (2) (both World Heritage Sites) (5).  However the latter is not secure (3) having been badly affected by influxes of Rwandan refugees and rebel soldiers (6).  Rugezi swamp in Rwanda home to the largest population of Grauer\xe2\x80\x99s scrub-warblers urgently needs protection (3).  An action plan which outlines a strategy to improve the conservation status of the Grauer\xe2\x80\x99s scrub warbler was published in 2006.  Priority actions include determining the distribution population size and trends of the species and minimising the impact of human activities at key sites (4).

Lowland forests have been converted to banana plantations and cattle ranching thus producing habitat that is no longer suitable for this parrot (2). In Costa Rica the mountain almond is logged as a valuable tropical hardwood used for flooring and truck beds; this tree provides vital food and shelter for the great green macaw and its removal has had devastating consequences to the species (8). In addition this highly attractive parrot is under demand from the illegal pet trade and may be captured as a result (2). In both Ecuador and Costa Rica numbers of the great green macaw are worryingly low (2).,The great green macaw is protected by law and international trade is prohibited by its listing on Appendix I of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) (3). The DariBiosphere Reserve Panama and the Los KatNational Park in Colombia protect the species\xe2\x80\x99 strongholds (2). The Great Green Macaw Research and Conservation Project has been working in Costa Rica since 1994 to raise awareness and carry out research into this stunning species (6). This parrot is an important flagship species as it is such a habitat specialist; its protection will help to conserve other rainforest species. The proposed creation of the Maquenque National Park would protect vital remaining habitat (6) of this species.

It is prized for its fins for shark fin soup as well as for its liver oil for vitamins its skin for leather and its meat for fishmeal (2). Catastrophic losses have occurred in the eastern Atlantic where directed fishing is unregulated while in the Gulf of Mexico and north-west Atlantic this species has suffered serious declines as a result of high mortality when caught accidently by commercial fisheries. Illegal fishing of this species for its valuable fins is also increasing in Australian waters. Like most other sharks the great hammerhead's\xa0slow growth and low number of offspring makes it highly vulnerable to overexploitation (1).,The great hammerhead is in urgent need of coordinated conservation efforts involving the management of directed fisheries and those that take this species as <strong>bycatch</strong>. Fortunately the increasing recognition of the detrimental effects of shark finning has led to the implementation of finning bans by fishing states in the U.S.A. Australia and the European Union. Nevertheless improved enforcement of legislation is required to prevent ongoing illegal finning activities. <strong>Bycatch</strong> limits for sharks in the South African longline fishery are also helping to conserve this imperilled species (1). ,loss;fishing; , ,2,0

It has been proposed that the greater adjutant should be moved from Schedule IV to Schedule I of the Indian Wildlife Act of 1972 to give it greater priority. Effective land management is necessary for the survival of this species particularly the control of pesticide use around feeding areas and the protection of feeding areas and nesting sites found outside protected areas.

The meat is highly prized and the cartilage underneath the <strong>plastron</strong> (known as 'calipee') is used in the production of turtle soup (8). In addition the green turtle is affected by a number of incidental threats including fisheries <strong>bycatch</strong> habitat degradation and disease. Building construction beach armouring and sand extraction are responsible for degradation of nesting habitat while light pollution at nesting beaches fatally attracts emerging green turtle hatchlings away from the sea. In the marine environment increased effluent over harvesting of algae and contamination from coastal development all negatively affect the quality of foraging habitat. In particular the degradation of marine habitats is implicated in the increase of fibropapillomas; fibrous tumours that can grow on almost any part of a turtles body impeding movement or sight and often leading to death (1).,The green turtle is protected by a raft of international legislation including the prohibition of international trade through its listing on Appendix I of CITES (1) (3). The result of numerous designations and agreements has been to notably reduce the intensity of direct impacts on the green turtle and in particular the rate at which eggs and adults are harvested. Nonetheless human impacts on the green turtle are still a significant concern with the lack of effective monitoring of fisheries responsible for considerable direct and indirect mortality while uncontrolled development continues to degrade the ecosystems that the green turtle depends on (1). ,environment;disease;pollution; ,cites;protected; ,3,2

Commercial poaching for skins has since declined due to effective protection measures put in place by Kenya and the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES). However in some areas Grevy\xe2\x80\x99s zebra is still hunted for subsistence meat and some ethnic groups use their fat for medicinal purposes such as treating tuberculosis. Habitat loss presents a major threat to the long-term survival of the species as grasslands and water sources have significantly declined due to unplanned grazing by livestock. In addition there has been a significant very recent decline in the species in northern Kenya due to disease and drought (7).,Grevy\xe2\x80\x99s zebra is listed on Appendix I of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) effectively banning international trade in this species (3). It is protected by law in Ethiopia and by a hunting ban in Kenya (1). This rare species also occurs mostly outside protected areas in communally-owned land and ranches where livestock-keeping is the principal livelihood (7). In addition the Lewa Wildlife Conservancy in Kenya currently holds 370 individuals representing 15 percent of the world\xe2\x80\x99s total population (8). ,loss;poaching;disease; ,cites;protected; ,3,2
East African crowned crane; South African crowned crane; southern crowned crane,Balearica regulorum,Grey crowned-crane (Balearica regulorum),Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Gruiformes,Gruidae,Balearica (1),3 - 4 kg (2),The principal threat to grey crowned-crane populations is the loss or degradation of suitable wetland habitat due to an increasing human population accelerating the demand for agricultural land and freshwater sources.\xa0Increased grazing pressures subtly alter wetland habitats and influence the abundance of insect prey and the availability of nest habitat (5). Increasing human populations also threaten grey crowned-crane habitat via wetland damming drainage increased sedimentation through deforestation and the use of agricultural pesticides (2) (7) (9).\xa0Further threats to the grey crowned-crane include the removal of live birds and eggs and this activity has been attributed to a recent rapid decline throughout much of the species\xe2\x80\x99 range (7).,The grey crowned-crane is listed under Appendix II of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) meaning that international trade in this species requires permits and must be carefully monitored (3). ,loss; ,cites;protected; ,1,2

For example this species may be caught in snares that were set for other animals (1) (5) (6). Like other <em>Rhinopithecus</em> species the grey snub-nosed monkey has also been hunted for food and traditional medicine and local people are often unaware of the laws protecting these species (6).,The grey snub-nosed monkey is found in the protected Fanjingshan Nature Reserve (1) (6) with only one small group known to move outside of this area (1) (5). The grey snub-nosed monkey is listed on Appendix I of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) which means that international trade in this species is permitted only in exceptional circumstances (4). The species is also listed as Category I under the Chinese Wildlife Protection Act of 1989 (1). ,hunting;environmental;environment;disease; ,cites;protected; ,4,2

The impact of this habitat destruction on grey-backed hawk populations has undoubtedly been severe. As western Ecuador becomes increasingly developed and road networks expand the pressure on this species and its habitat will only increase. Even in the areas where the grey-backed hawk is protected such as the Mache-Chindul Ecological Reserve illegal logging and hunting are common (2) and other activities that are detrimental to the bird\xe2\x80\x99s habitat such as livestock grazing have been allowed to continue (6).,Although enforcement is severely lacking populations of the grey-backed hawk residing within conservation areas such as Machalilla National Park and Mache-Chindul Ecological Reserve in Ecuador and Tumbes Reserved Zone (a part of the Northwest Peru Biosphere Reserve) in Peru do at least receive a modicum of protection (2). ,hunting; ,protected; ,1,1

In fact the caged-bird trade is the greatest threat to the species with unsustainably high numbers of birds being trapped and removed from the wild. The grey-cheeked parakeet is listed on Appendix II of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species but this does not regulate internal trade or trapping within Ecuador and Peru (3).,International trade in this species is banned in both Ecuador and Peru. It occurs in several protected areas of which Cerro Blanco Protection Forest Ecuador and Tumbes Reserved Zone Peru are particularly important and regular population monitoring takes place. The timing of the breeding season has yet to be established and research will contribute positively to any conservation efforts. Strict bans on collection of the grey-cheeked parakeet and conservation education programmes may prove to be the key to the continuation of this species (2). , ,protected; ,0,1
Animalia,Crocias langbianis,Grey-crowned crocias (Crocias langbianis),Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Timaliidae,Crocias (1),Length: 22 cm (2),Prior to its re-discovery in 1994 the grey-crowned crocias had not been seen in over 50 years. Since 1994 it has been observed with increasing frequency albeit at the same few sites (3). However given its very small range and the constant threat of habitat loss this species remains at a very high risk of extinction. Forest degradation caused by logging clearance of land for agriculture fuel-wood collection and charcoal production threatens all the known sites for this species. Furthermore an increase in the size of the human population in the region of the Da Lat plateau attributable to a governmnet resettlement programme is putting even further pressure on the remaining forest habitat (2) (3).,While the only site at which the grey-crowned crocias is relatively common Chu Yang Sin Nature Reserve is ostensibly protected no protection measures actually exist and its boundaries have not been decided. Fortunately compared with other areas of the Da Lat plateau the Chu Yang Sin Nature Reserve is under much less pressure from degradation due to its remoteness. Nonetheless it is still a priority to develop management activities within the reserve and to ensure the reserve\xe2\x80\x99s effective protection together with other areas of broadleaved evergreen forest on the Da Lat plateau (2) (3). ,loss; ,protected; ,1,1

Large areas of the Cordillera de Caripe have been cleared for agriculture and pasture. Forest clearing and burning for coffee and fruit plantations are degrading the <strong>montane forest</strong> habitat reducing the available understory on which the grey-headed warbler depends for survival (3).,Large areas of the grey-headed warbler\xe2\x80\x99s habitat are protected within El Gu\xc3\xa1charo National Park and the reserve was recently expanded to include a further 500 square\xa0kilometres of largely undisturbed forest.

This combined with the continuous threat of hunting has resulted in a 50 percent drop in grizzled leaf monkey numbers in the last decade (12) and it was estimated in 1996 that less than 2500 mature individuals remain in their natural habitat (1).,Remaining populations of the grizzled leaf monkey occur in a number of protected areas in western Java including Ujung Kulon National Park Halimun National Park and Gede-Pangrango National Park which will hopefully offer some protection from habitat disturbance and hunting (1).

Collection for the pet trade continues today but is not believed to pose such as serious threat as habitat loss (1). The conversion of forest habitat into agricultural land is the greatest threat to the survival of the Guatemalan spiny-tailed iguana (1) (7); the impacts of which are exacerbated by this species\xe2\x80\x99 restricted distribution. (1).,The Guatemalan spiny-tailed iguana does not currently receive any legal protection and is not known to occur within any protected areas and thus action to prevent its extinction in the wild is clearly urgently needed (1). In 2007 the International Iguana Foundation initiated a campaign to raise funds for an Iguana Specialist Group workshop aimed at the spiny-tailed iguanas and to implement recommended conservation actions that arise from that workshop (7). Captive populations of the Guatemalan spiny-tailed iguana exist in several zoos around the world (1) which may act as an insurance against this species\xe2\x80\x99 entire extinction yet this does not lessen how devastating it would be to lose this armoured reptile from the wild. ,loss;pet; ,protected; ,2,1

However as with many groupers the long life span slow growth late maturity and unusual life history of the Gulf grouper together with its small geographical range and its tendency to come together in large <strong>spawning</strong> aggregations all increase its vulnerability to overfishing (1) (6) (7) (8). The population of this once abundant fish is believed to have declined severely more than halving in the last 30 years (1) (6) and even more alarmingly may have declined by over 99 percent since the 1940s (1). In the Gulf of Mexico the sex ratio of the population is currently skewed with significantly fewer males than females. Sadly increased coastal development in the northern Gulf of California and greater investment in recreational fisheries look set to increase reef habitat destruction and intensify fishing pressure on the Gulf grouper in the future (1).,The Gulf grouper occurs in a few protected areas throughout its range including within the Alto Golfo Biosphere Reserve although enforcement in this area is lacking (1). There are no specific conservation measures known to be directly targeted at this large reef fish although there have been calls to protect and manage the <strong>spawning</strong> aggregations of groupers and other reef fish (7) (8) a measure which may also help to protect this vulnerable species. ,fishing;overfishing; ,protected; ,2,1

The species occurs in a number of state owned forests; however the management of these areas does not necessarily take into consideration the management of this <strong>subterranean</strong> mammal. The potential for some of these forests to be sold to private ownership and commercial forestry operations also means that this species could become even more threatened (1) (9). Several farms in the vicinity of Magoebaskloof are earmarked for housing development that will further fragment its already restricted distribution (10).,There are no specific conservation measures in place for Gunning\xe2\x80\x99s golden mole but it is known to occur in the De Hoek New Agatha and Woodbush Forest Reserves. To implement appropriate conservation measures further research is needed to clarify the uncertainty surrounding the distribution of this species and to further assess the relative importance of the various threats it faces. In addition raising public awareness of the mere existence of this highly elusive species and its important ecological role as insect-eating small mammal is of cardinal importance for the continued survival and conservation for future generations (3) (9). , , ,0,0

By the middle of the 1980s just 4.7 percent of the original forest cover remained (4). Hunting disturbance by humans and trade are also believed to have played a part in the decline (4). Deforestation continued illegally in Thailand throughout the 1990s and several Gurney\xe2\x80\x99s pitta <strong>territories</strong> were destroyed as a result (4).,A wildlife sanctuary was established in 1993 but much of the habitat of Gurney's pitta was excluded. In 1990 the Khao Nor Chuchi Lowland Forest project was established this is a socio-economic community-level conservation and development project the aims of which are diverse. Achievements include the creation of more wildlife friendly areas amongst a mosaic of cultivation tree planting supporting forest protection workers and promoting sustainable agriculture (4). However difficulties have plagued the project. It is clear that unless drastic action is taken and the crucial 30 kilometre squared area of suitable habitat is completely protected soon this species will become extinct (4). ,hunting; ,protected; ,1,1

A single otter pelt may fetch up to $200 an attractive reward to many hunters who often live in economically poor areas and the hairy-nosed otter may also be hunted for its meat with hunting still particularly rampant in Tonle Sap Lake and the Mekong Delta (5) (10). As a result of this hunting otter populations across Southeast Asia have undergone substantial declines (1) (14).,The hairy-nosed otter is protected by law in all of its range states and is also listed on Appendix II of the Convention on the International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) which should ensure that international trade is monitored (1) (4). Its habitat is also protected in some areas by the RAMSAR Convention and the Convention on Biological Diversity and it is found in a number of protected areas (1) (10). In reality however this species has received little protection mainly because of a lack of law enforcement at the local level and hunting and habitat loss has continued to threaten this Endangered species (3) (10). In addition to improved law enforcement this species would also benefit from further studies into its ecology and further surveys in areas which could potentially support populations such as the Irrawaddy Delta as information on its distribution is limited while there is no such information on its population (3) (6).\xa0 \xa0 ,loss;hunting;disease;pollution; ,cites;protected; ,4,2

Drying out of its habitat is also a serious threat and is expected to increase in the future as a result of global climate change (1).,The conservation of the Hajar Wadi damsel will require ongoing management of good quality running waters (1) as well as measures to combat water pollution and the protection of suitable habitats (4). Research priorities for the damselflies and dragonflies of this region include further <strong>taxonomic</strong> assessments a complete identification key for all species and regular monitoring of the status and habitat use of <strong>endemic</strong> limited range species such as the Hajar Wadi damsel (4). ,loss;pollution; , ,2,0

Animalia,Oreomystis mana,Hawaii creeper (Oreomystis mana),Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Drepanididae,Oreomystis (1),Length: 11 cm (2),Habitat loss and degradation are present on Hawaii Island but since the Hawaii creeper is known to reproduce despite the disturbance this is not thought to be the major threat to this species. Hawaii has been subjected to a high numbers of species introductions which have had wide-ranging ecological effects. Feral pigs degrade native forests enabling the spread of alien plant species and disease-carrying mosquitoes. The mosquitoes carry pox and malaria which caused epidemics amongst birds in 1992 reducing populations significantly including the Hawaii creeper. Compounding these declines introduced rodents predate heavily on Hawaii creeper eggs reducing breeding success (2).,Honeycreeper habitat has been protected by the creation of the Hakalau Forest National Wildlife Refuge and the Hawaiian creeper is also found in the Hawaii Volcanoes National park where feral goats are actively excluded. The feral pig population has been tackled by Hawaiian conservation authorities and private landowners and cattle have been removed from some reserves. Planting of koa trees began in the early 1990s and research into the possibility of aerial release of rodenticides is being undertaken. Captive breeding is not taking place but is possible if thought to be necessary at a later stage (2). ,loss;disease; ,captive breeding;protected; ,2,2

Koloa maoli,Anas wyvilliana,Hawaiian duck (Anas wyvilliana),Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Anseriformes,Anatidae,Anas (1),461 - 605 g (3),By the mid 20th century the combined impacts of predation by non-native animals habitat loss for agriculture and urban development and over-hunting decimated the once abundant Hawaiian duck to around 530 individuals (2). Fortunately with protection and prohibition of hunting the population recovered to around 2000 at the beginning of this century (2) (5) (6). However today a much more subtle dynamic presents the greatest threat to the species survival. Non-native mallards were first introduced to Hawaii for ornamental ponds and farming in the 1800s and in the 1950s and 1960s hundreds were imported to stock hunting areas. Since then cross-breeding between the two closely related species has had a dramatic influence on the number of pure Hawaiian ducks particularly on Oahu and Maui. Furthermore it is now suspected that even the core populations on Kauai and Niihau contain hybrids (2) (5). In addition to <strong>hybridisation</strong> several other more conspicuous threats continue to have an impact on this species including predation by introduced mammals habitat loss wetland modification by alien plants and human disturbance (2).,The establishment of several State and Federal wildlife sanctuaries in conjunction with legal protection under endangered species laws and a program of re-introductions of captive bred birds was instrumental in the recovery of the Hawaiian duck population during the latter half of the 20th century (2) (4) (6). In the late 1980s a ban was placed on the importation of mallards except for research and exhibition and was followed in 2002 by the implementation of restrictive import regulations on all birds shipped to the islands to protect the public from West Nile Virus (2) (5). Even so the mallard continues to reproduce on the islands and is still sold commercially (5). The priority therefore is to control populations of mallards and <strong>hybrids</strong> to prevent irreversible genetic swamping of the Hawaiian duck populations (2). This is to be achieved via a three-pronged approach involving public outreach humane removal of feral mallards and hybrids and stronger regulatory controls on non-native potentially harmful ducks (4). Already underway is an outreach and communications plan and field key for differentiating pure birds from <strong>hybrids</strong> (4) (5). ,loss;hunting; , ,2,0
Animalia,Partulina physa,Hawaiian tree snail (Partulina physa),Animalia,Mollusca,Gastropoda,Stylommatophora,Achatinellidae,Partulina (1),,As a result of human disturbances the Hawaiian Islands have seen devastating extinction rates and today over half of the described tree snails are thought to be extinct (7). Having suffered from habitat loss the Hawaiian tree snail is now restricted to just a single location with a population of less than 1000 individuals (5). This species first came under threat when the first settlers on the Hawaiian Islands began logging the lowland forests replacing natural habitats with agricultural lands and cattle ranches. These destructive activities were compounded by the introduction of non-native predators such as rats and the predatory snail <em>Euglandina rosea</em> and alien plant species which overgrow native plant seedlings limiting natural forest regeneration (2). As a result the Hawaiian tree snail listed as a Species of Concern by the United States Fisheries and Wildlife Service is under severe threat of extinction (8). The survival of this species is also hindered by its slow reproduction rate and the degradation of its habitat by feral pigs and goats (5) (6). \xa0,Like many other Hawaiian snail species the restricted geographic range and small population size of the Hawaiian tree snail makes it vulnerable to habitat degradation and consequently its survival may be dependant upon conservation measures (6). Fortunately for this species efforts are underway to protect its fragile habitat. In 2003 the Ponoholo Ranch which encompasses the Hawaiian tree snail\xe2\x80\x99s habitat entered the Kohala Watershed Partnership which resulted in fencing being built along three sides of the ranch to exclude wild cattle while plans were made to cull wild pigs and remove invasive weeds. The Nature Conservancy has also agreed a 15-year management plan with the ranch with the development of a management plan for the Hawaiian tree snail a key priority (4). This vulnerable species is also benefiting from a captive breeding facility coordinated by the University of Hawaii on Lanai (5). With the successful implementation of these measures and further efforts to remove predators and limit habitat loss there is significant hope that the future of the Endangered Hawaiian tree snail will be secured (1). ,loss; ,captive breeding; ,1,1

Due to the coastal habitat of Hector's dolphin the species is vulnerable to a large number of other threats such as pollution vessel traffic and habitat modification as well as fisheries <strong>bycatch</strong> (1).,The New Zealand Marine Mammals Protection Act has made the deliberate killing or injury of marine mammals illegal (1). Under this act the Department of Conservation designated the Banks Peninsula Marine Mammal Sanctuary in 1988 effectively prohibiting commercial gillnetting and restricting recreational gillnetting. A second protected area was designated on the west coast of the North Island in 2003. These were surpassed by new Ministry of Fisheries regulations in 2008 which ban gillnetting to four nautical miles off the majority of the South Island\xe2\x80\x99s east and south coasts regulate gillnetting on the South Island\xe2\x80\x99s west coast to two nautical miles (3.7 kilometres) offshore and extend the gillnet ban on the North Island\xe2\x80\x99s west coast to seven nautical miles (13 kilometres) offshore. Five marine mammal sanctuaries were designated around the coastline in 2008 to provide additional protection from non-fisheries related impacts (13). ,pollution; ,protected; ,1,1

Animalia,Pterodroma atrata,Henderson petrel (Pterodroma atrata),Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Procellariiformes,Procellariidae,Pterodroma (1),Length: 36 - 37 cm (2) (3),The Henderson petrel is undergoing a long-term decline on Henderson Island as a result of chick predation by introduced Polynesian rats (<em>R. exulans</em>) (2) (6) (7) (8) which have been estimated to kill 25000 petrel chicks on the island each year (9). If this species ever bred on Pitcairn Island its disappearance there is also likely to have been caused by introduced rats and cats (2) and it has not been confirmed to breed on Ducie Island since 1922 (3) probably for the same reasons. However other than for rats and a few introduced plants the ecology of Henderson Island is still remarkably intact with little human impact because of the island\xe2\x80\x99s remote location and rough terrain. Although Pitcairn Islanders travel to the island to cut wood this has little impact at current levels and a potentially damaging attempt by a millionaire to build a house airstrip and cattle ranch on the island in the 1980s was denied permission. Any increase in tourist visitors to this uninhabited island may be of concern as it could increase the risk of environmental damage and the accidental introduction of further mammalian predators (10) (11) (12).,Although rat and cat eradication attempts on Pitcairn Island have not yet been successful rats have been successfully eliminated from Ducie and Oeno raising the chances of the Henderson petrel becoming established on these islands in the future (2) (3). Although rat eradication on Henderson Island is made more difficult by its remote location (2) it will be vital if the decline of the Henderson petrel is to be halted. Fortunately recent research has addressed potential obstacles to an eradication programme and rat eradication is planned to start in 2011 subject to sufficient funding (9) (13). ,environmental;environment;pet; , ,3,0

Himalayan muskdeer; Himalayan musk-deer,Moschus leucogaster,Himalayan musk deer (Moschus leucogaster),Animalia,Chordata,Mammalia,Cetartiodactyla,Moschidae,Moschus (1),13 â 18 kg (2),The primary threat to the Himalayan musk deer is hunting for musk a highly-desired product has been used in perfumes and traditional medicines for over 5000 years (1) (9) (10). Although it is no longer in such demand due to the availability of cheaper synthetics it is still found in as many as 400 Chinese and Korean medicines and may sell for as much as $45000 per kilogram making it one of the most valuable animal-derived products in the world (4) (10). As a result of its high value and the poor economic state of many communities within its range hunting of the Himalayan musk deer has been unsustainable (1) (11). Animals are indiscriminately caught using snares and although only adult males produce musk both females and juveniles are also caught with between three and five deer killed per harvested musk pod. In some regions the Himalayan musk deer may also be hunted for its meat while its habitat is threatened by encroaching pastoral farming (1) (11). \xa0,The Himalayan musk deer is protected by law in Bhutan Nepal and India. In China hunting may be permitted in some areas although a license is required. This Endangered species is also found in a number of protected areas; however the uneven enforcement of legislation across its range has meant there has been little impact on preventing the rampant trade in the species (11). Improving the enforcement of anti-poaching laws is deemed a key priority for the conservation of this species (1).\xa0 ,hunting; ,protected; ,1,1

This decline has been highest in the eastern parts of its range where it is suspected to have undergone at least a 90 percent decrease. The hog deer is now one of the most threatened large mammals in Indochina and is believed to be extinct in Laos Vietnam Thailand and most of Cambodia. Furthermore it is believed extinct in China and most of Bangladesh. In India and Nepal outside of protected areas few viable populations remain and severe hunting pressure exists (1).,A rare and vulnerable species the hog deer is in drastic need of critical conservation measures. Recognising this every country within the species\xe2\x80\x99 range has afforded the hog deer full protection from hunting (1). The relict Indochinese population in Kratie Cambodia has received extra protection and the WWF Greater Mekong Programme supports a number of rangers that patrol the area deterring hunters. WWF has also begun community education and ecotourism programmes that aim to highlight the plight of this vulnerable population (5) (10). Furthermore Global Wildlife Conservation is developing plans to protect the newly discovered population in Botum-Sakor National Park southwest Cambodia although the total population size is unknown (6). The hog deer is also found in a number of protected areas including some of the most secure reserves in the world such as the Corbett Tiger Reserve in India. It has also indirectly benefited from the conservation of the Indian rhinoceros (<em>Rhinoceros unicornis</em>) with which it co-exists in wet grasslands. However many reserves are not big enough to allow seasonal movements and the level of legal enforcement received varies (1).\xa0 ,loss;hunting; ,protected;wwf; ,2,2

The tree is sought after for both its high quality timber and medicinal resin which are of commercial value and have been traded for several centuries (1) (4) This has led to intense logging making it extremely rare across its entire range (1) and close to local extinction in 11 countries (8). The holywood lignum vitae was previously found in El Salvador but has now gone regionally extinct there (1) (4). Regeneration of the holywood lignum vitae is being encouraged but due to the slow growth rate of this species progress is slow (1).,The holywood lignum vitae is included on the convention on the\xa0Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) Appendix II regulates its international trade (2).

Unfortunately dry thorn-forests are the most endangered ecosystem in Honduras and have been reduced by a drastic 90 percent. Vast areas of thorn-forest have been converted to rice and pineapple plantations and cattle pastures while urbanisation and agriculture continue to encroach upon the Honduran emerald\xe2\x80\x99s habitat\xa0 (5) (6). In the R\xc3\xado Agu\xc3\xa1n valley only 84 square kilometres of suitable Honduran emerald habitat remains while in the Agalta valley there is less than one square kilometre. Furthermore much of the remaining habitat is privately owned for cattle grazing and receives no form of protection. Consequently the population of the Honduran emerald is now critically small and it is considered the rarest bird in Central America and one of the most endangered birds in the world (4) (5) (8) (9).\xa0,In Honduras a small poor country with a rapidly growing economy conservation is a major challenge (6). However the American Bird Conservancy is working to ensure the rare Honduran emerald is afforded increased protection through the acquisition of 30 square kilometres of suitable habitat (4) (5). The Fundaci\xc3\xb3n Pico Bonito a Honduran conservation organisation has also successfully secured funding from the World Bank to invest in habitat protection and to mitigate the effects of planned road constructions (6). The Honduran emerald will also benefit from numerous other proposed measures including the extension of the Sierra de Agalta National Park to encompass the species\xe2\x80\x99 range the establishment of a network of protected areas and further studies into the species\xe2\x80\x99 ecology (5) (6) (9).

It is also hunted for its meat skin and eggs and is collected for the exotic pet trade where like all <em>Ctenosaura</em> species it is in high demand (1) (6).,Relatively little is currently known about the Honduran paleate spiny-tailed iguana so further knowledge of this species is imperative if conservation efforts are to be successful. A project funded by the International Iguana Foundation was initiated in 2008 to develop accurate estimates of population size and distribution (7) which will allow for more effective conservation management of this distinctive reptile. The project includes the involvement of local people which helps to raise awareness of this iguana\xe2\x80\x99s importance and will be a key part in the survival of this species (7). ,loss;pet; ,protected; ,2,1

Sinai cat snake,Telescopus hoogstraali,Hoogstraalâs cat snake (Telescopus hoogstraali),Animalia,Chordata,Reptilia,Squamata,Colubridae,Telescopus (1),Total length: up to 102 cm (2),The main threat facing Hoogstraal\xe2\x80\x99s cat snake is its fragmented distribution which makes it intrinsically more vulnerable to extinction (1). Populations of Hoogstraal\xe2\x80\x99s cat snake are in decline in Egypt because its habitat is being destroyed and the habitat quality is decreasing. Human activities that are reducing its habitat include overgrazing by livestock quarrying firewood harvesting and over-collection by scientists. This species is also sometimes killed on roads (1).,There are not known to be any specific conservation measures currently targeted at Hoogstraal\xe2\x80\x99s cat snake. However this poorly known reptile occurs in Dana Wildlife Reserve in Jordan and in another reserve in part of Sinai Egypt which may offer it some protection (1). , , ,0,0

Habitat loss is consequently the greatest threat to the survival of this species and the development of new roads allows ever-more pristine forest to be exploited (4).,The horned guan is protected in both Guatemala and Mexico and international trade in the species is prohibited by its listing on Appendix I of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) (3). A small number of individuals have been bred in captivity and many populations are located within reserves. Despite these measures however the number of individuals is estimated to be fewer than 2500 and appears to be declining (4). ,loss; ,cites;protected; ,1,2

Poaching is still a major threat to this species even though hunting is now illegal. Other threats include predation by pumas foxes and domestic dogs habitat destruction fires and livestock ranching.  Locally over-grazing construction and recreational activities may prove detrimental to the huemul (2) (3). In addition large areas of forest have been harvested and replaced by agriculture and exotic tree forestry operations (2) resulting in huemul populations becoming isolated and therefore more vulnerable to local extinction (6).,An estimated 1000 to 2000 individuals survive today (2006) and this number is thought to be declining (3) (7).  Several projects are in progress surveying the range and population of the huemul. Two large non-governmental organisations in Argentina and Chile are working together to survey the border areas that are home to this species; however this is difficult due to the rugged terrain of the region (2). ,hunting;poaching; ,protected; ,2,1

Its life history characteristics make this species extremely vulnerable to exploitation and the population can only sustain light levels of fishing (4). Traditionally the flesh of this fish has been highly prized and more recently this species has become one of the most highly sought species of the Live Reef Food Fish Trade (LRFFT) a luxury food industry that has undergone an increase in popularity in many eastern Asian countries (4). Humphead wrasse can fetch up to US $100 per kilogram at retail in Hong Kong (4) and as their numbers dwindle the rarity of the species is likely to increase the price (4). Cyanide is typically used to catch fish for this trade because live fish are difficult to take any other way; a practice that devastates coral reefs (4).,Little is known of the biology and distribution of the humphead wrasse and more data are urgently needed to understand the scale of the threats faced by current populations and to implement effective conservation programmes (4). The World Conservation Union's (IUCN) Groupers and Wrasses Specialist Group is working to collect this all-important data and to raise awareness of the issues involved throughout the region (4). The species is partially protected in areas of Australia the Philippines the Maldives and Palau and was proposed for inclusion in Appendix II of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) in November 2002 (4). Trade restrictions are particularly important as this species cannot be hatchery reared and all individuals in trade come from wild populations (5). ,fishing; ,cites;protected; ,1,2

Hunting pressure is high in many of the remaining forested areas with Huon tree kangaroos hunted primarily by natives of Papua New Guinea for their succulent meat. Although traditionally hunted by people with dingoes which had relatively little impact on populations the introduction of guns to the island has dramatically increased the numbers that can be caught and severely jeopardised the future of this species (2).,The main focus of conservation efforts for this species has been on captive-breeding programmes with individuals held at a number of zoos worldwide (2). Woodland Park Zoo in Seattle is a leader in captive breeding and reproduction research on the Huon tree kangaroo being the first to recognize the importance of isolating females after mating to reduce stress on the mother and increase infant survival rates (5). A Species Survival Plan has also been developed by international zoos for this species which focuses on field studies and preserving the species\xe2\x80\x99 natural habitat whilst at the same time maintaining and studying a large captive population and stressing the need for education on the detrimental effects of forest destruction and hunting (3). It is vital that such education awareness campaigns are directed towards local people and government officials alike if the decline of this beautiful unusual species is to be halted. ,hunting; ,captive breeding; ,1,1

In the 1980s it is estimated that at least 10000 birds were taken from the wild (2). Throughout the macaw\xe2\x80\x99s range habitat is being lost or altered due to the introduction of cattle ranching and mechanised agriculture and the development of hydroelectric schemes (2).,The hyacinth macaw is protected by law in Brazil and international trade is prohibited by its listing on Appendix I of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) (2). There are a number of long-term studies and conservation initiatives in place; the Hyacinth Macaw Project in the Brazilian State of Mato Grosso do Sul has carried out important research by ringing individual birds and has created a number of artificial nests to compensate for the small percentage of sites available in the region (5). The effective enforcement of protection laws is required if this beautiful parrot is going to be saved from the fate of the other Brazilian parrots Lear's (<i>Anodorhynchus leari</i>) and Spix's macaw (<i>Cyanopsitta spixii</i>) which now teeter on the brink of extinction. ,loss;pet; ,cites;protection law;protected; ,2,3

imperial parrot; sisserou,Amazona imperialis,Imperial Amazon (Amazona imperialis),Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Psittaciformes,Psittacidae,Amazona (1),Length: 45 cm (2),The precipitous decline of this species known to number just 80-100 individuals in 1993 was the result of a combination of factors including habitat loss caused by conversion of forests to plantations and hurricane damage as well as hunting for food and trapping for the pet trade (2). Subsistence hunting was prevalent throughout the mid to late 1940s and the species continued to be hunted for the pet trade into the 1980s (8). Thankfully strict law enforcement a comprehensive education and awareness campaign and national pride have all but eliminated threats from poaching since the early 1990\xe2\x80\x99s (2) (7). Despite an increase in numbers the population remains low with estimates of between 150 and 250 adults remaining (4) (8) and the species is therefore still classified as Endangered by the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species (1). Habitat loss still poses a serious threat however and as lowland forests are increasingly cleared the imperial Amazon may face competition for nest sites with the related species <i>Amazonia arausiaca</i> (2).,The imperial Amazon has benefited from Dominica\xe2\x80\x99s long history of forest conservation and more recently from intensive governmental and non-governmental efforts to protect its habitat and make local citizens aware of its needs (8). Indeed it is as a result of a dedicated conservation programme targeted at the imperial Amazon spearheaded by the partnership between Dominica\xe2\x80\x99s Forestry Wildlife and Parks Division and the Rare Species Conservatory Foundation (RSCF) (8) that numbers of this species have slowly increased. To date this partnership has significantly aided this endangered parrot through integrating extensive protected-area and law enforcement legislation with staff training education and public awareness and research on both captive and wild populations (8) (6). A major result of this programme of conservation has been the creation of the Morne Diablotin National Park in the known nesting area for the species (5) first initiated in 1997 (8). An <i>in situ</i> captive programme has long been in place to research and rehabilitate the birds and a pair of imperial Amazons that has resided at the Parrot Conservation and Research Centre (Forestry Wildlife and Parks Headquarters in Roseau) since 2000 laid their first clutch of infertile eggs in April 2006 revealing important information about their reproductive biology (7). A very successful education programme in Dominica has substantially reduced trade and raised local awareness of the plight of Dominica\xe2\x80\x99s national symbol (2). International trade in this parrot is also tightly restricted by its listing under Appendices I of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) and the bird is protected by law on Dominica (2). The imperial Amazon\xe2\x80\x99s comeback from a small remnant population on the slopes of Morne Diablotin following Hurricane David to near pre-hurricane levels is a testament to the effectiveness of Dominica\xe2\x80\x99s long-term conservation efforts (8). ,loss;hunting;poaching;pet; ,cites;protected; ,4,2

Longlining is mainly used to catch tuna and swordfish by releasing a line of baited hooks that sink to the appropriate depth for these fish. Many seabirds dive for the bait before it has sunk becoming caught on the hooks and drowning as the line reaches its final depth (2).,Prince Edward Island is a Special Nature Reserve where all fauna is protected. Population monitoring and foraging studies have been carried out on Amsterdam Island and vaccines against the bacterial diseases have been tested but these cannot be carried out on a large scale (2).

social bat,Myotis sodalis,Indiana bat (Myotis sodalis),Animalia,Chordata,Mammalia,Chiroptera,Vespertilionidae,Myotis (1),5 â 11 g (2),Recently the Indiana bat has been suffering from a decline in numbers due to a range of threats.  During <strong>hibernation</strong> the Indiana bat is vulnerable to human disturbance which can cause direct mortality or cause them to rouse and deplete their important energy reserves.  Disturbance can be in the form of researchers vandalism and the commercialization of caves allowing tourists to visit caves.  Modifications to mines and caves such as the construction of gates to restrict human access alter airflow temperature and humidity to which the Indiana bat is very sensitive; or gates may not allow sufficient flight space for the bats and thus block them from a critical <strong>hibernation</strong> site (2) (3).  As Indiana bats <strong>hibernate</strong> in very large numbers in only a few caves this makes them particularly vulnerable to disturbance and natural disasters as a large proportion of the total population can be affected by a single event (3).,As well as being classified as Endangered on the IUCN Red List 2007 (1) the Indiana bat is also listed as Endangered under the Endangered Species Act of 1973.  As an outcome of this the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service has drawn up a recovery plan with the goal of improving the status of the Indiana bat so that it can be removed from the Endangered Species List (3).  To reach the goal a number of actions are required; conserving and managing the hibernacula and the summer habitat conducting further essential research and implementing a public information and outreach program.  Dependent on funding and the implementation of conservation actions it has been estimated that the species can fully recover by the year 2027 (3).  At present the primary conservation effort has been to control human access of caves by erecting properly designed gates that keep people from disturbing hibernating bats while maintaining temperature humidity and allowing access for bats (3). ,loss; ,endangered species act; ,1,1
Indri Ã Queue Courte,Indri indri,Indri (Indri indri),Animalia,Chordata,Mammalia,Primates,Indriidae,Indri (1),6 â 9.5 kg (2),The indri is one of the most endangered species of lemur on Madagascar and one of the most threatened primates in the world (4). They live by the coast where forests have become so fragmented that they are almost too small to sustain viable populations (6). The main threat is slash-and-burn agriculture a practice that continues even in protected areas (7). Forests are also cut down for fuel and timber as human populations increase (5). Hunting of the indri is a taboo in many areas on the island so this species does not suffer as much as other lemurs from trapping although sometimes it is killed for food (5) (7). Despite this the indri is a seriously endangered species and will almost certainly face extinction in the next 100 years if conservation efforts do not succeed (4).,The indri has never been bred successfully in captivity (7). Protection of their natural habitat is therefore imperative to ensure that they are not lost forever (6) (7). Unfortunately there is no easy answer to Madagascar\xe2\x80\x99s conservation problems. Despite the indri being endangered Madagascar\xe2\x80\x99s increasing human population needs space and resources and inevitably this erodes natural habitats (4). This problem is made worse because Madagascar is an island; this therefore limits the area that men and wildlife can expand into (6). Conservation plans have designated some areas of the island to be protected from deforestation but there is evidence that forest clearing continues inside the parks (5) (7). It would be sad indeed to see the indri populations once so prevalent dwindle away to nothing (6). ,hunting; ,protected; ,1,1

Animalia,Nesopsar nigerrimus,Jamaican blackbird (Nesopsar nigerrimus),Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Icteridae,Nesospar (1),Length: 18 cm (2),The past and current major threat to the Jamaican blackbird is habitat destruction as a result of afforestation with Caribbean pine (<i>Pinus caribaea</i>) and clearance for the creation of coffee plantations. Trees are also removed for making charcoal and small-scale farming and development is a constant threat to the area of habitat that remains. This bird species is particularly threatened by the removal of large trees as these are the support for the bromeliads and <strong>epiphytes</strong> that the blackbird forages amongst. Their removal also makes space for the invasive species wild coffee (<i>Pittosporum undulatum</i>) which prevents the growth of epiphytes and therefore further hinders the Jamaican blackbird (2) (4).,A network of reserves and national parks exists across Jamaica and whilst the Jamaican blackbird is found in several of these including the largest which spans 800 km\xc2\xb2 of the Blue and John Crow Mountains they are poorly managed and protected and their long-term future is not secure. The conservation of Cockpit Country would be of great benefit to the species and consequently funding is being sought to create a reserve there (2). ,invasive; ,protected; ,1,1
Manchurian crane; red-crowned crane,Grus japonensis,Japanese crane (Grus japonensis),Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Gruiformes,Gruidae,Grus (1),7,000 - 10,000 g (2),These beautiful birds were almost hunted to extinction in Japan at the beginning of the 20th century for their stunning plumage (9). Habitat losses due to agriculture and development have been further causes of the decline in the Japanese crane (1). Wetlands are fragile ecosystems and both the wintering and breeding grounds are under increasing risk of degradation and loss due to conversion to agriculture and industrial development (8).,A number of international agreements have been made to protect crane species and their habitats and it is illegal to hunt Japanese cranes in all countries in which they occur (6). Protected areas have been established to safeguard the species; furthermore conservation and educational programmes have been developed with the involvement of local communities and a number of reintroduction attempts have been made (6). Research into the ecology habitat needs and breeding biology of this graceful crane has been carried out since 1970 (6). ,loss; ,protected; ,1,1

The native forests of Java have been cleared for logging agriculture and development and the species has declined to fewer than 1000 individuals over the last 25 years (4). This gibbon appears to be on the very brink of extinction with only a handful of isolated viable populations remaining (6).,In light of the status of this species in the wild a Javan gibbon rescue and rehabilitation workshop was conducted in 1997 hosted by Conservation International and the University of Indonesia (2). It was agreed that a rescue and rehabilitation centre was needed and education programmes were proposed (5). Currently the only viable protected population is found within the Gunung Halimun National Park; if this attractive primate is to survive it is vital that protection both within the park and in other areas is increased (6). ,pet; ,protected; ,1,1
Aguila-azor de Java,Spizaetus bartelsi,Javan hawk-eagle (Spizaetus bartelsi),Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Falconiformes,Accipitridae,Spizaetus (1),Length: 60 cm (2),Habitat loss caused the initial decline of this bird as the increasing human population of Java relies heavily on the natural resources of their island particularly its forests. Conversion to agriculture urban development and uncontrolled fire even in protected areas resulted in a sharp decline that prompted the Indonesian government to promote the Javan hawk-eagle to the status of \xe2\x80\x98national bird\xe2\x80\x99. However this move rebounded as trade in the species multiplied in response to its new significance and consequential desirability (2).,The range and population of this species have been surveyed revealing its presence in Gunung Haliman Gunung Gede-Pangrango and Meru Betiri National Parks. However despite the strict legislation protecting the eagle from hunting and trading it faces serious problems through ineffective enforcement of the law. An action plan has been compiled and conservation awareness programmes have begun. The action plan suggests that thorough ecological studies are performed to allow the implementation of management plans. Nest-guarding is being seriously considered as an option to enforce legislation protecting this beautiful species (2). ,loss; , ,1,0

Java is the most densely inhabited Indonesian island and urbanisation and agriculture continues to encroach upon the island\xe2\x80\x99s forests (7). However the montane forests that remain on Java are now relatively stable in their limited extent (8).,With a small population and an extremely restricted range the survival of the Javan trogon may be dependant upon the successful implementation of conservation measures (1). Thankfully this rare species has been afforded some protection in the Gunung Gede-Pangrango and Gunung Halimun National Parks with the latter supporting the largest remaining population (4).

The remaining forest in C\xc3\xb4te d'Ivoire and Sierra Leone is highly fragmented and remains under pressure as humans seek to use more forest for farmland timber fuelwood and mineral resources (9).,Jentink\xe2\x80\x99s duiker is listed on Appendix I of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) meaning that international trade in this species is only allowed in exceptional circumstances (3).  However this does little to control the threat of hunting within its range countries and whilst in some areas of its distribution hunting of wild animals is now prohibited (2) such a ban is impractical and cannot be enforced (9).  Unlike Sierra Leone and C\xc3\xb4te d'Ivoire Liberia still holds some large areas of forest with the largest stands being in protected areas and forest reserves (9).  The continued protection of these areas appears to be essential to the continued survival of Jentink\xe2\x80\x99s duiker along with efforts to educate the public about the plight of duikers and the importance of sustainable hunting (10). ,loss;hunting; ,cites;protected; ,2,2

Habitat loss caused by farming and human settlement is also a problem (2). Sadly this rare bird also faces the occasional threat of collection for museums; in 2006 scientists from Louisiana Museum captured and killed two out of three specimens of the Jocotoco antpitta recently discovered in northern Peru (5).,The discovery of this antpitta led to the establishment of <i>Fundacion Jocotoco</i> which initiated efforts to protect the locality at which the species was first discovered; to this end the Tapichalaca Reserve was set up at the site (6). In September 2003 the Christopher Parsons Memorial Forest adjacent to the Tapichalaca Reserve was purchased with the help of the World Land Trust following an appeal launched by Sir David Attenborough. Christopher Parsons was described by Sir Attenborough as the most important natural history film maker of the last century. His last project before his death in 2002 was the development of ARKive.

Animalia,Eurycea tonkawae,Jollyville Plateau salamander (Eurycea tonkawae),Animalia,Chordata,Amphibia,Caudata,Plethodontidae,Eurycea (1),Length: 5.5 cm (2),The major threat that the Jollyville Plateau salamander faces is urbanisation which is expanding rapidly in Austin Texas (2) (4) (5). The abundance of this salamander has been found to decrease as the degree of urbanisation increases (2) (4). One site that the Jollyville Plateau salamander inhabits has been affected by building work resulting in increased levels of nitrate (4). This has coincided with an increase in recordings of spinal deformities in the Jollyville Plateau salamander population (2). This species is also likely to be affected by other forms of pollution including from chlorinated water from swimming pools (3) (4). In addition to pollution the habitat of the Jollyville Plateau salamander is being degraded by altered water flow (3) (5) including increased flow rates due to discharges from urban areas which can wash away the salamanders or the cover upon which they depend (3). As they are small and localised the freshwater springs this species inhabits are also susceptible to drying and drainage (2).,As the Jollyville Plateau salamander has only recently been discovered there is little information of its historical abundance. Studies are being conducted into the relationship between salamander abundance and distribution and habitat and water quality in order to devise policies for their protection (5). Long-term monitoring of water quality and continued surveys of this species have also been recommended (4). ,pollution; ,endangered species act; ,1,1

Around three million hectares of <em><strong>Cerrado</strong></em> is destroyed each year within the region with road construction and the expansion of soya crop cultivation the primary agents. The species\xe2\x80\x99 habitat is also frequently degraded by artificial fires for cattle ranching (2). As a result of such severe threats Kaempfer\xe2\x80\x99s woodpecker is suspected to have a highly patchy distribution and a small population size currently estimated at no more than 250 mature individuals (2) (3).\xa0,As the species\xe2\x80\x99 habitat is still relatively prevalent and due to probable inconspicuous habits something that is characteristic of <em>Celeus</em> woodpeckers Kaempfers\xe2\x80\x99s woodpecker may be more numerous than currently thought.

KagÃº,Rhynochetos jubatus,Kagu (Rhynochetos jubatus),Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Gruiformes,Rhynochetidae,Rhynochetos (1),Length: 55 cm (2),The loss of much of New Caledonia's native forests has caused the numbers of kagus to decline. Forests have been cleared for timber and to make way for agriculture and these birds have also traditionally been hunted for their meat. Kagus are island birds that have evolved in isolation and in the absence of terrestrial predators; when Europeans first arrived on New Caledonia they bought with them rats cats and dogs and these flightless birds represented easy prey (4). Today dogs may represent the most important threat to the survival of this species; in 1993 dogs killed 17 out of 21 radio-collared birds within the reserve of Pic Nigua alone (2).,Kagus are protected within the Riviere Bleue and dogs are controlled in this area (2). They are also found within the Reserve Speciale de Faune et de Flore de la Novdela where there is no dog control in place (2). In 1992 Birdlife International initiated a Recovery Programme for this species. A captive breeding programme run by the Southern Province and the Societe Caledonienne d'Ornithologie has been in place since 1978 (4) and juveniles have been released into the Riviere Bleue Park with some success (4). Dog attacks are difficult to control despite legislation and education of owners but remain a priority for the secure future of this species (2) which is now the national bird of New Caledonia (4). ,loss; ,captive breeding;protected; ,1,2

Reasons for this marked decline include extensive habitat losses due to forest clearing pressures from hunting predators and introduced competitors (4).,To tackle the threats facing the kaka predator and pest control surveys are being carried out in several large areas and near nesting sites (2). Populations are also being monitored with juveniles being radio tracked to identify their movements habitat and food requirements and survival rates (4).

Due to its habitat requirements the kaka-beak was probably never a common plant and may owe its survival partly to the old-time Maori who cultivated it in their villages (6).   Today a large secure cultivated population exists although it appears to contain very limited genetic diversity (7).,Most of the 200 remaining wild specimens occur within the boundaries of the Te Urewera National Park and the extensive cultivated populations do provide potential for reintroductions.

For example between 1994 and 1999 6560 keeled box turtles were legally exported from Vietnam. This major threat is compounded by habitat loss and degradation due to deforestation and shifting cultivation (7).,Due to the unsustainable trade in this species the keeled box turtle was listed in 2003 on Appendix II of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) and thus trade should now be strictly controlled and monitored (3).

Narrow sawfish; pointed sawfish,Anoxypristis cuspidata,Knifetooth sawfish (Anoxypristis cuspidata),Animalia,Chordata,Chondrichthyes,Rajiformes,Pristidae,Anoxypristis (1),Length: up to at least 470 cm (2),The knifetooth sawfish was once widespread and common throughout the Indo-West Pacific region but its population has become increasingly small and fragmented with the global population believed to have decreased by over 80 percent in the last 30 to 50 years (1) (6) (12). The unique structure of the saw makes all sawfish extremely vulnerable to entanglement and capture in a range of fishing gear both in targeted fisheries and as accidental <strong>bycatch</strong>. Although most landings are accidental the knifetooth sawfish is highly valued for its meat fins liver oil and skin and when caught is usually retained. The saw is also highly valued both as a curio and for use in traditional Chinese medicine (1) (2) (4) (6) (12). An increasing demand for live specimens for public aquaria may be putting further pressure on this species (1) (6) (11).,In 2007 the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) listed the knifetooth sawfish on Appendix I meaning that international trade in the species is now banned (3). The knifetooth sawfish is legally protected in India (1) (6) but little other effective legislation appears to exist for the species elsewhere (4). In Australia monitoring research and recovery plans have been recommended for all sawfish (6) (11) (12) but the knifetooth sawfish has yet to be listed there under the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act (EPBC) 1999 (1) (11). Recent advances in obtaining DNA samples from dry sawfish rostra (13) together with studies into DNA \xe2\x80\x98barcoding\xe2\x80\x99 from confiscated fins (14) may help fishing authorities to gather essential data on the illegal fishing of sawfish and other sharks and rays hopefully assisting in the management and conservation of this unique and Endangered fish. ,loss;fishing;environment; ,cites;protected; ,3,2

This is likely to have played a major part in the disappearance and represents the biggest threat to the survival of this rare species today (3).,<i>Kniphofia reflexa</i> is the only member of this genus to be found in central-West Africa making its conservation particularly important (3). The conservation priorities are annual monitoring of the three known sites to determine the state of the populations as well as searches for possible new areas (1). Propagation of <i>Kniphofia reflexa</i> from seed with a view to reintroducing this species to the Afua Swamp is also a possibility (2).  , , ,0,0

The 'garden route' area of South Africa is becoming increasingly developed and this is having a detrimental effect on the population (6). This species is the only seahorse that has so far been identified to be primarily at risk from habitat damage (5).,The Knysna seahorse is protected in South Africa and may only be collected with a permit (3). Further research into population distribution and the behaviour of the species is urgently needed before an effective conservation action plan can be implemented. , ,protected; ,0,1

Animalia,Callaeas cinereus,Kokako (Callaeas cinereus),Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Callaeidae,Callaeas (1),Length: 38 â 50 cm (2) (3),The combination of deforestation and the introduction of <strong>invasive</strong> mammalian predators in two waves of human colonisation since 1270 AD nearly extirpated this species.  Just one quarter of the forest present 1000 years ago is still standing. European settlers brought with them ship rats brush-tail possums stoats and wild cats (1) (2) (4) which prey heavily on young and female kokakos at the nest leaving an excess of males who are not able to breed. These males sometimes pair up and nest with each other in the absence of female partners (9). Whilst in 1999 the North Island kokako population stood at 1160 birds only 396 of these were female thus limiting the number of reproducing pairs (10).,Intensive recovery planning and management since the mid 1980s has substantially recovered North Island kokako populations.  In 2007 there were 18 increasing populations totalling 850 pairs.  Such intensive management is vital as nearly all unmanaged populations are now extinct.  <strong>Translocations</strong> have established populations on four offshore islands and restored kokako to three sites in their original range (Wairarapa Hawkes Bay and East Cape) and further <strong>translocations</strong> are planned as part of widespread active restoration of mainland New Zealand forest ecosystems.  The recovery of the kokako requires intensive control of introduced mammal pests particularly ship rats and brushtail possums (9).  Some populations are now managed by pulsed control effort a method in which pest control has \xe2\x80\x98on\xe2\x80\x99 and \xe2\x80\x98off\xe2\x80\x99 years.  This effectively controls pest populations whilst minimising the input of pest control poisons at any site and means that conservation resources can be spent on other sites or problems during the \xe2\x80\x98off\xe2\x80\x99 years (11). ,invasive; , ,1,0

Animalia,Metacnemis valida,Kubusi stream damsel (Metacnemis valida),Animalia,Arthropoda,Insecta,Odonata,Platycnemididae,Metacnemis (1),,This endangered damselfly has disappeared from some of its former range and is now known from only two sites which are unprotected and experiencing ongoing habitat loss and degradation (1). Habitat loss is principally the result of cattle farming but additional threats include alien invasive trees (particularly black wattle <i>Acacia mearnsii</i>) shading out the habitat pollution of the Kabusi River from domestic washing and siltation of the stream from cattle trampling the banks (1). Predation by introduced rainbow trout may also pose a threat (1).,A massive national rehabilitation scheme (Working with Water Programme) began in 1995 with the aim of eradicating invasive alien plants in South Africa. The programme has been a fantastic success story with other dragonflies and damselflies (e.g. harlequin sprite <i>Pseudagrion newtoni</i>) that were presumed to be extinct being rediscovered along river stretches where invasive alien trees were removed and the natural vegetation re-established (3). Thus continued work by the Working with Water Programme in the removal of alien plants could also help the Kubusi stream damsel recover in a similar way (4). A further important conservation measure advocated is the translocation of this species to a protected area where it could find safe refuge from the damaging impacts of pollution and cattle farming (1). ,loss;invasive;pollution; ,protected; ,3,1

Deforestation is followed by burning and reseeding but these young trees will not make suitable nest sites for another 150 years (5).,Already endangered this species cannot fully recover for 50 \xe2\x80\x93 100 years as the old trees that are crucial to its lifestyle are currently too young. Populations in sub-optimum older-aged and mixed-aged forest are less dense than populations in optimal habitat but older forests are thought to be less at risk from wildfires (3). Therefore a management plan is in place that involves protecting both optimum and sub-optimum habitat with a nature reserve system as well as an alternative logging system that preserves high quality habitat (3). Experiments with the introduction of nest boxes have been partially successful with 13 out of 96 nest boxes now occupied by Leadbeater\xe2\x80\x99s possum (7). , , ,0,0

Indigo macaw,Anodorhynchus leari,Lear's macaw (Anodorhynchus leari),Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Psittaciformes,Psittacidae,Anodorhynchus (1),Length: 74 cm (2),Lear's macaw is thought to be a naturally rare species (4) and population numbers were low when it was discovered in 1978. The major threat to this species comes from the illegal wildlife trade. Collectors will pay high prices for such rare and beautiful birds and a breeding pair is thought to be worth as much as \xc2\xa350000 on the black market (4). The population of Lear's macaws is also highly influenced by the availability of their principal food source the licuri palm numbers of which have recently been vastly reduced due to livestock-grazing (5). A major fire could now wipe the whole palm population out (5) leaving this parrot fatally vulnerable.,Although protected by the Brazilian government and listed on Appendix I of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) effectively banning international trade in the species the Lear's macaw remains critically at danger from illegal trade (5). Recent infiltration of poaching rings and guarding of roosting sites may be finally slowing the decline in this species and there are plans to grow and fence 50000 licuri palm seedlings (5). A recent population survey has reported an encouraging increase in Lear's macaw numbers in the wild; in the municipalities of Canudos and Jeremoabo the population now stands at around 455 individuals (6). The steady increase in the population has led to the IUCN downgrading the Lear\xe2\x80\x99s macaw from Critically Endangered to Endangered in 2009 although continued conservation measures and repeated monitoring of the population remain high priorities to ensure the continued protection of this species (8). , ,cites;protected; ,0,2

Now tourism has taken over from agriculture as their chief industry and coastal development has further decimated iguana habitats particularly affecting communal nest sites (2).,The Lesser Antillean iguana is legally protected from hunting throughout its range but law enforcement is limited. It occurs only in one protected area: Cabrits National Park on Dominica. Proposals for the creation of nature reserves in other areas of the iguana\xe2\x80\x99s range have been put forward and research into the population biology ecology and conservation management plans is underway.

Eupodotis indica,Sypheotides indicus,Lesser florican (Sypheotides indicus),Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Gruiformes,Otididae,Sypheotides (1),Length: 46 - 51 cm (2),A steady decline in the population of the lesser florican began around the 1870s principally as a consequence of relentless hunting for sport and food (2). In time other familiar threats became increasingly more significant including habitat loss through agricultural land conversion and over-grazing of livestock and the rapid encroachment of non-native vegetation (2) (6). In the 1980s the world population of lesser florican declined by 60 percent to just over 1600 birds but fortunately rebounded by the mid 1990s to a moderately less alarming 2200. These recent fluctuations have been found to closely match breeding season rainfall patterns and reveal the vulnerability of the species to extinction in the event of a severe drought. Worryingly it is anticipated that the pressure on remaining grassland habitat is set to continue in the future and as result the rate of decline in the lesser florican population will increase (2).,Despite the prohibition of hunting of lesser floricans throughout India and inclusion on Appendix II of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) and under Schedule 1 of the Wildlife (Protection) Act 1972 the species\xe2\x80\x99 long-term survival remains uncertain because of the continued threat of rapid habitat loss coupled with high vulnerability to drought (2) (3) (6). In an effort to preserve breeding habitat two lesser florican sanctuaries Sailana and Sardarpur in Madhya Pradesh were established in 1983 (2) (7) (8). However the value of these sanctuaries is limited by the movement of monsoonal conditions which determine which areas lesser floricans choose to breed. If weather conditions are unfavourable in any given year only a small number of floricans may actually breed within the protective bounds of the sanctuaries (8). In recent years a proposal known as \xe2\x80\x98Project Bustards\xe2\x80\x99 has been put to the Indian government to ensure the survival of India\xe2\x80\x99s four species of bustard all of which are endangered (2) (8). This broadly includes: strictly protecting bustard habitat involving local communities in conservation establishing regional cooperation amongst different states and increasing scientific research into bustard ecology. An ambitious proposal specific to the lesser florican is to develop a network of fodder-producing grasslands throughout its range to afford local communities fodder security whilst also providing optimal breeding habitat for the lesser florican during the monsoon (8). Unfortunately until \xe2\x80\x98Project Bustard\xe2\x80\x99 receives government approval these vitally important proposals remain on paper and the lesser florican leaps ever closer to extinction. ,loss;hunting; ,cites; ,2,1

Only 1% of the original habitat remains today due to widespread deforestation for timber agriculture and development (4). This species persists in isolated pockets of remaining forest which can lead to <strong>inbreeding depression</strong> thus further threatening their precarious status (5). Additional threats come from hunting; they may be persecuted as crop pests and are often mistaken for Nilgiri langurs (<i>Semnopithecus johnii</i>) whose meat is erroneously believed to have medicinal properties (2) (4).,This species is one of the most endangered macaques in the world (4). International trade is banned by their listing on Appendix I of the International Convention on Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) and they are also protected by Indian law (7). Lion-tailed macaques are found in at least 21 protected areas (2) but they are the subject of few studies or conservation programmes (4). A large captive population has been developed in American and European zoos as part of a Species Survival Plan (SSP) and this population has the potential to be used in reintroductions should this become necessary (2). ,hunting; ,cites;protected; ,1,2

Comoro black fruit bat; Livingstoneâs bat,Pteropus livingstonii,Livingstoneâs flying fox (Pteropus livingstonii),Animalia,Chordata,Mammalia,Chiroptera,Pteropodidae,Pteropus (1),500 â 800 g (2),Once abundant in the vast forests of Anjouan and Moheli extensive deforestation has led to the worryingly small populations of Livingstone\xe2\x80\x99s flying fox in existence today (9).,A conservation action plan for Old World Fruit Bats which includes Livingstone\xe2\x80\x99s flying fox was published in 1992 by the World Conservation Union (IUCN) which outlined a number of measures required for the survival of this species.  One recommendation was the establishment of a captive breeding programme (9) which was quickly initiated.  In 1992 five male and one female Livingstone\xe2\x80\x99s flying foxes were imported to the Jersey Wildlife Preservation Trust (now the Durrell Wildlife Conservation Trust).  This captive population increased in 1993 with the addition of five more males and another female and five further females were added in 1995 (10).  The programme has apparently been successful with (as of 2002) 42 individuals existing in captivity in three colonies at Jersey and Bristol zoos (11).  In 2007 a new comprehensive plan called the <i>Conservation Action Plan for Livingstone\xe2\x80\x99s Flying Fox</i> was developed for the species and its habitat.  This plan identified a conservation strategy focusing on actions such as habitat protection forest management environmental education population monitoring captive breeding and ecological research.  Initial steps are now underway to implement this plan (12). , ,captive breeding; ,0,1

Fisheries captured 32000 loggerhead turtles in the Atlantic and 10500 in the Gulf of Mexico in 1987 alone (7). Loggerheads are unlikely to be deliberately hunted for their meat which is not considered a delicacy but eggs are collected in many parts of the world (7). Habitat loss or disturbance particularly developments on nesting beaches is the main threat to this species (9).,Loggerheads are nominally protected throughout most of their range and international trade is prohibited by their listing on Appendix I of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) (3). Nesting occurs on relatively few protected beaches however and increased protection remains a conservation priority. In Oman if locals must collect eggs they are encouraged to only take them from below the high water mark thus securing an income without harming the turtles' survival chances (9). Turtle Excluder Devices (TEDs) fitted to shrimp trawlers can help prevent <strong>bycatch</strong> by only allowing shrimp-sized objects to enter the nets and these are now being adopted by many of the world's fisheries (7). ,loss; ,cites;protected; ,1,2

In Victoria about half of the range of the long-footed potoroo occurs in State Forest which is used for multiple purposes including intensive logging. In such landscapes logging prescriptions have been modified to lessen the impact on potoroos including higher degrees of habitat retention. In New South Wales nearly all known habitat for the species occurs in National Park (6). Wildfires and periodic fuel-reduction burning have a largely unknown effect on the species and the fungi on which the potoroo depends for food although in the short term loss of ground cover due to fire may be detrimental to survival (3). The long-footed potoroo occurs in small highly isolated populations so genetic problems resulting from inbreeding are a possibility. Moreover small populations are at great risk of extinction caused by chance events such as fire drought or disease (3).,Information on this elusive rare species is sparse and so further studies into habitat selection breeding dispersal diet and the threats affecting this species are needed in order to effectively conserve it (5). A small breeding captive population was held at Healesville Sanctuary through the 1980s and 1990s which allowed research on the behaviour and reproduction of the species otherwise difficult to observe in the wild (3). The ongoing status of the captive colony is unclear as the last remaining animal died recently (6). In Victoria on State Forest tenure the species is protected in a series of Special Management Areas in which logging is either prevented or monitored and controlled burning reduced (2) (6). Wild dog and red fox control is undertaken to varying degrees across much of the range of the long-footed potoroo. Feral cat control is undertaken on a more limited basis (3). Special Management Areas for long-footed potoroos in Victoria will benefit a wide range of other native species including the marsupial carnivore the spotted-tailed quoll (<i>Dasyurus maculatus</i>) which is also threatened (3). ,loss;disease; ,protected; ,2,1

Changes in forestry management with the increasing use of pesticides and native tree canopy species being replaced with exotics has resulted in forest fragmentation and gaps in the canopy (1) (3). Coffee plantations have also been felled and replaced with ginger cultivation (3). Consequently many populations of the long-tailed climbing mouse have been left isolated greatly increasing the species extinction risk (1).,There are currently no conservation measures in place for the long-tailed climbing mouse and it is not known to occur in any protected areas. However further surveys in the Brahmagiri and Pushpagiri Wildlife Sanctuaries may find additional populations. This Endangered species will also benefit from further studies into its distribution ecology and population status (1). ,loss;fragmentation; ,protected; ,2,1

The tropical Andes including the owlet\xe2\x80\x99s range are classified as a biodiversity hotspot but it is estimated that only 25 percent of the original habitat remains in this area (11). Although some areas of <strong>montane forest</strong> in north-east Peru remain relatively pristine (12) deforestation is accelerating (10).,The main conservation measures aimed at or affecting the long-whiskered owlet involve the protection of its habitat. Until recently the owlet\xe2\x80\x99s habitat was completely unprotected (6); although the species occurred near to the Alto Mayo Protected Forest in San Mart\xc3\xadn (2) protection was only partial (14) and had little effect on the rate of deforestation (2). ,loss;poaching; ,protected; ,2,1

Plantae,Pinus palustris,Longleaf pine (Pinus palustris),Plantae,Tracheophyta,Coniferopsida,Coniferales,Pinaceae,Pinus (1),Max height: 47 m (2),Prior to European settlement the longleaf pine grew in extensive pure stands throughout the coastal plains of the southeastern United States (4). Today however the distribution of pine savannas dominated by the longleaf pine is less than three percent of its original extent. The dramatic decline in its distribution is attributable to over harvesting particularly during the 19th century as well as clearance for urban development agriculture and pine plantations (6). Furthermore the fragmentation and mismanagement of the remaining stands has resulted in the suppression of wildfires allowing non-fire tolerant hardwood species to outcompete the longleaf pine (2) (6) (8) (9). Consequently broadleaved hardwood forests in the region are now far more extensive than they were in pre-settlement times (9).,Considerable efforts are being made to restore longleaf pine across its natural range. Organisations such as the Longleaf Alliance are bringing together private landowners forest industries state and federal agencies conservation groups and researchers to determine the most appropriate means for revitalising this threatened ecosystem. Given that the vast majority of forested land in the southeastern United States is privately owned much of the effort is focused on restoration on private land (10). ,loss;fragmentation;pet; , ,3,0

Lord Howe rail,Gallirallus sylvestris,Lord Howe Island woodhen (Gallirallus sylvestris),Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Gruiformes,Rallidae,Gallirallus (1),Length: 46 cm (2),During the 19th Century the population of Lord Howe woodhen was decimated by the introduction of predators and by habitat disturbance caused by settlers arriving on the island (4). Recent control measures mean that feral animals are not such a threat today although the introduction of the Australian masked-owl (<i>Tyto novaehollandiae castaneothorax</i>) in an effort to control rat numbers in the 1920s is thought to have been responsible for a major decline in one population in 1989 (5). As it is restricted to a single island the woodhen remains highly vulnerable to natural catastrophes or the accidental introduction of further non-native predators or disease (5).,In the mid-1970s the population of Lord Howe woodhen teetered on the brink of extinction as the population reached a new low of less than 30 individuals (4). Since that time conservation efforts such as the removal of wild pigs and the release of captive-bred birds have helped this species to slowly recover. The population is now estimated at 130 birds (2002) and the local community is very involved with conservation efforts which can minimise the threat of predation and disturbance by pet dogs (5). The trends in population numbers continue to be monitored but at this time the future looks encouraging for the Lord Howe woodhen. ,disease; , ,1,0

Most of the longleaf pine ecosystem has been logged or has been destroyed or degraded by other land uses such as urbanisation agriculture and intensive cultivation of other pine species (1) (2) (3) (4) (10). Only around three percent of its original extent now remains (13).,A Candidate Conservation Agreement was established in 2004 to protect conserve and manage the Louisiana pine snake. This agreement involves protecting remaining populations and their habitat restoring degraded habitat maintaining the longleaf pine ecosystem and reducing the threats to the Louisiana pine snake\xe2\x80\x99s survival (1) (4). ,loss;pet; ,protected;endangered species act; ,2,2

The major threats are hunting and habitat loss which is occurring in Sulawesi due to the draining of marshland agricultural development and logging (1). Anoas are hunted for their desirable meat which is sold in local markets. In addition the skull and the horns are made into trophies souvenirs and used in traditional medicine (4). ,Sulawesi\xe2\x80\x99s forests have the highest level of mammal <strong>endemism</strong> in Asia and there are several conservation programmes underway on the island (7). The lowland anoa is fully protected under Indonesian law though there is concern that this is not enforced well enough as hunting continues even inside protected reserves (1).

Protection of its riverside forests will not only help this endangered dragonfly but also the farmers of the foothills by guaranteeing soil stability and a steady flow of water (5).

Wetland habitats in Madagascar have been lost to conversion to rice cultivation and degraded by siltation as a result of deforestation in the surrounding land (4).  The collection of the heron\xe2\x80\x99s eggs and the capture of nestlings by local people for food is also impacting heron populations (2) (4) and these damaging activities are only expected to increase as the human population in western Madagascar continues to rise (4).  The depletion of the heron\xe2\x80\x99s prey by local fisheries is also a potential threat (4).  Finally wetlands in Madagascar have been declining for a long time as the climate has become increasingly drier (4) hinting at the negative impact global climate change could have on this species.,Fortunately the Madagascar heron occurs in four protected areas in west Madagascar (2) including Ankarafantsika Strict Reserve Ankarana Special Reserve and Baly Bay National Park but with around 50 percent of the global population living outside protected areas (4) clearly more needs to be done.  Surveys to locate important nesting and feeding sites of the Madagascar heron have been recommended (2) (4) as well as the effective protection of known sites and further research to determine this species\xe2\x80\x99 biology and conservation needs (2).

HÃ©ron crabier blanc,Ardeola idae,Madagascar pond heron (Ardeola idae),Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Ciconiiformes,Ardeidae,Ardeola (1),Length: 45 - 48 cm (2),It is thought that the population is declining quickly largely due to over-harvesting of the eggs and young (1). Furthermore the introduced invasive fish <i>Micropterus salmoides</i> may be competing with this heron for food (2).,The Madagascar pond-heron has been classified as Vulnerable by the IUCN Red List (1) and is included in Appendix II of the Convention on Migratory Species (CMS) (2). Suggested measures include carrying out surveys on this species to gain a better knowledge of the size of the population. More research is needed on the ecology of the species in order to better understand the threats facing it at present. Important colonies must be protected and a local public education campaign has been proposed to try to reduce harvesting of the eggs (2). ,invasive;pet; ,protected; ,2,1
Animalia,Threskiornis bernieri,Madagascar sacred ibis (Threskiornis bernieri),Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Ciconiiformes,Threskiornithidae,Threskiornis (1),Length: 65 â 89 cm (2),The main threats to the Madagascar sacred ibis come from the harvesting of its eggs the trapping of adults and the taking of chicks for human consumption. Estimates of this species\xe2\x80\x99 population on Madagascar in 2006 indicated that there were less than 2000 mature individuals a number that is simply too small to support the current levels of exploitation. Unfortunately the Madagascar sacred ibis displays no fear of humans while nesting or roosting and is therefore an easily obtainable source of food for hunters. While legislation on hunting does exist in Madagascar it has proved ineffective in reducing hunting pressure on this species with surveys indicating that populations of the Madagascar sacred ibis are significantly declining (2).,The Aldabra population of the Madagascar sacred ibis estimated in 2001 to be around 300 to 750 individuals currently receives significant protection (2). The entire atoll is designated a Strict Nature Reserve and a Natural World Heritage Site and only small scale ecotourism deep-sea fishing and limited exploitation of some resources are permitted. However the conservation of the island and enforcement of its protection are the responsibility of the Seychelles Island Foundation which requires subscriptions and donations in order to fund its valuable work (5). ,loss;hunting;pollution; ,protected; ,3,1

Bernierâs teal,Anas bernieri,Madagascar teal (Anas bernieri),Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Anseriformes,Anatidae,Anas (1),Length: 40 - 45 cm (2),The Madagascar teal is threatened throughout its range (2) largely by the massive destruction of wetland habitats that has occurred in Madagascar (4). Conversion of shallow water bodies required by this species in the dry season to rice cultivation has been rife on the west coast of Madagascar and today mangroves are in demand for prawn pond construction and timber extraction both of which result in an increase in hunting for food (2) (5).,The Madagascar teal is listed as Endangered by the IUCN Red List which means that it faces a high risk of extinction in the wild (1). International trade in the species is controlled by its listing under Appendix II of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) (3). The Durrell Wildlife Conservation Trust initiated a captive breeding programme for this species in 1993. This programme has had great success and shed light on certain details of the life-cycle and behaviour of this elusive and shy duck. However until major steps are taken to protect the remaining habitat of the species in the wild reintroduction measures will be unlikely. Community education programmes and habitat protection are essential if this desperately threatened duck is to survive (4). ,hunting; ,cites;captive breeding; ,1,2

Agricultural pesticide use also presents an additional risk as the toxic chemicals used in farming can contaminate the prey on which these bats feed (1) (2).,The Madeira pipistrelle is protected through the Bern Convention (11) and by its listing on Annex IV of the EU Habitats and Species Directive which means that protective measures must be taken to ensure its conservation (12). It is also protected under the Agreement on the Conservation of Populations of European Bats (EUROBATS) which aims to protect all 52 species of bats in Europe through legislation education conservation measures and international co-operation (13).\xa0 ,loss; ,protected; ,1,1

Approximately 80% of its coastal woodland habitat has been cleared to make way for agricultural practices such as banana sugar-cane and pineapple plantations and for cattle grazing (6). Fragments of remaining habitat may not be large enough to support viable populations and are vulnerable to wildfires and to further clearing (5).,The mahogany glider is listed on the Australian Endangered Species Protection Act 1992 (6) and the Queensland Parks and Wildlife Service is working to protect the remaining areas of habitat (5).

This fascinating species had persisted in the gardens of temples in the East and the first seeds were brought to Europe in the 1700s (3). The loss of the <i>Ginkgo</i> from the wild is likely to have been a result of deforestation which has swept through the region (1).,It is uncertain whether the maidenhair tree still persists in the wild and at present there are no conservation projects in place. Cultivated trees are found throughout the world however and a multi-million dollar industry has cashed in on the leaves' medicinal properties (3).

For centuries Madagascar\xe2\x80\x99s forests have experienced successive waves of degradation at the hands of human colonists each with different destructive patterns of land use (7). In more recent years illegal and commercial logging charcoal production and burning to clear land for agriculture or cattle pasture have all had a devastating impact often changing open forest into dense shrubby undergrowth unsuitable as rat habitat or destroying the vegetation completely (3). The rats continue to suffer from human disturbance in the remaining forests which are used by the villagers to gather firewood collect honey dig up edible roots and hunt tenrecs and lemurs (3) (7). Predation by introduced predators such as dogs may also be playing a significant role in this species\xe2\x80\x99 decline (3).,This large rodent is in urgent need of conservation and its future remains highly uncertain. The Durrell Wildlife Conservation Trust is currently working closely with the Madagascan government and local community to help protect the species and has also established a captive breeding programme (5). The Menabe Forest an Alliance for Zero Extinction site due to the presence of this and a number of other endangered species was previously heavily impacted by subsistence farming wood extraction and livestock ranching. Fortunately in order to protect its unique but rapidly diminishing biodiversity the Madagascan government aims to expand the nation\xe2\x80\x99s protected area network and on March 28 2006 the Minister of the Environment Water and Forests signed a decree giving 125000 hectares of Menabe Forest temporary protected status. This is the first step towards making the site an official protected area. However while community and conservation groups have begun the slow process of agreeing on the official boundaries and goals of the new protected area (9) prospectors have begun using dynamite to search for oil reserves in Menabe causing concerns about further forest degradation (7). Official full protected status is urgently needed in this area if the Malagasy giant rat is to be successfully brought back from the brink of extinction. ,loss;pet; ,captive breeding;protected; ,2,2

Unsustainable harvesting of its eggs by locals for food and human disturbance of nesting grounds have led to the abandonment of most coastal nesting colonies which has disastrous effects on the maleo\xe2\x80\x99s breeding potential. A recent survey indicated that of the 131 formerly known nesting grounds an astounding 42 have been abandoned by the maleo. Furthermore 38 are severely threatened 34 are threatened 12 are of unknown status and only five are not yet threatened (4).,This <strong>endemic</strong> species has been protected under Indonesian law since 1972 and over 50% of (chiefly inland) nesting grounds occur within protected areas. Conservation measures at present include researching the numbers of breeding birds the effectiveness of hatcheries and artificial incubation programmes sustainable egg-collection practices and renewing local community-based protection projects (4). Eco-tourism is also being encouraged as an alternative income to egg-harvesting (2). There are also plans to improve management practices in protected areas and extend these protected ranges to encompass other important nesting sites and forest corridors which will link fragmented areas together (4). ,fragmentation;invasive; ,protected; ,2,1

Although it is illegal to destroy mangrove forests in Costa Rica laws are largely ignored and the entire Pacific coast of Costa Rica is under significant pressure from coastal developments for industry and tourism (4). Large tracts of mangrove forest have been cleared to make room for salt extraction and shrimp ponds while the wood may be exploited to produce charcoal. Mangroves are also threatened by agriculture and urban encroachment pollution and by dyke and road construction which affect the water hydrology (8) (10).,Restricted to a dwindling habitat in a single region the survival of the mangrove hummingbird is dependant upon the implementation of major conservation measures (1) (6). Fortunately for this species a wealth of conservation initiatives have been proposed including further studies into its ecology and status the establishment of protected areas and the development of a conservation action plan (4) (6).

Detailed research has been carried out on this murrelet and a recovery plan has been produced. Furthermore 179 km\xc2\xb2 of Afognak Island has been protected since 1998 by the Exxon Valdex Trustee Council.

The marine otter has been hunted for many centuries for its pelts which are used mainly for footwear. This has resulted in continuing population declines across the range. More recently the marine otter has also been subjected to habitat loss as a growing tourism industry has led to increased coastal construction and participation in water sports. Water pollution following oil spills and heavy metal mining over-fishing of prey species persecution by fishermen and drowning in crab traps and fishing nets are also contributing to this charismatic species\xe2\x80\x99 decline (2).,The marine otter is legally protected in Peru Chile and Argentina and occurs in several protected areas but human poverty levels are high along the coasts and the pelt of one marine otter is worth the same as a month\xe2\x80\x99s wages. With poor law enforcement hunting is an attractive source of income and both a change in public attitude to otters as well as increased law enforcement are necessary in order to slow the decline of this species. Conservation work is becoming more common in South America and it is hoped that this will create a higher level of awareness in the public about the marine otter\xe2\x80\x99s plight (2). ,loss;fishing;pollution; ,protected; ,3,1

The main cause of the precipitous decline has been excessive hunting both for meat and for its impressive horns (1) (7). Owing to the occurrence of armed conflict and the ready availability of weapons through much of its range many populations have been hunted to extinction. In addition to being highly valued as a trophy species by sportsmen the horns are also used for traditional medicine in the East Asian market (1) (2) (7). Aside from hunting the markhor is also severely threatened by habitat loss and competition for food with domestic livestock (1).,Since the mid-1990s the markhor has been listed on Appendix I of CITES which prohibits all trade in this species without a permit. In addition it is legally protected through much of its range and occurs within several protected areas although enforcement is likely to be a problem in some regions. One of the most successful conservation initiatives for the markhor has been a trophy hunting program developed in Pakistan. Local communities are encouraged to conserve the markhor through economic incentives whereby a large percentage of the money generated by a small quota of legal trophy hunts goes to the community. Owing to the success of this program proposals have been made for the implementation of similar trophy hunting conservation schemes in other parts of the markhor's range (1). ,loss;hunting;pet; ,cites;protected; ,3,2

In some areas pesticide contamination and predation by domestic pets may be additional concerns (1).,There are no specific conservation measures in place for Marley\xe2\x80\x99s golden mole but it is known to occur in the protected Pongola Nature Reserve. In order to implement appropriate conservation measures further research is needed to clarify the uncertainty surrounding the distribution of this elusive species and to assess the relative importance of the various threats it faces (1). ,pet; ,protected; ,1,1

SÃ£o TomÃ© maroon pigeon; SÃ£o TomÃ© olive pigeon; SÃ£o TomÃ© pigeon,Columba thomensis,Maroon pigeon (Columba thomensis),Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Columbiformes,Columbidae,Columba (1),Length: 37 â 40 cm (2)Male weight: 520 â 530 g (2)Female weight: 350 â 352 g (2),On the island of S\xc3\xa3o Tom\xc3\xa9 large areas of forest have been cleared for coffee and cocoa plantations. Today remaining <strong>primary</strong> and <strong>secondary forest</strong> continue to be cleared for cultivation timber and fuelwood (5). This habitat destruction has greatly reduced the range of the maroon pigeon and continues to force it into an ever decreasing area of montane forest (2). Coupled with the impact of habitat loss is the ever-present threat of hunting. Their docile nature makes them an easy target and they are also lured closer by fires lit by hunters (2). The maroon pigeon\xe2\x80\x99s extinction on Rolas shows how such threats can impact on the species and gives a grim insight of what may happen on S\xc3\xa3o Tom\xc3\xa9 if action is not taken.,Strict protection of the maroon pigeon and its remaining habitat is vital if this species is to survive (4). Protected zones of <strong>primary</strong> forest and the establishment of a National Park on S\xc3\xa3o Tom\xc3\xa9 have been proposed (6) and a new law regarding the protection of areas and threatened species awaits ratification (5). It is hoped that these essential measures are implemented before the attractive maroon pigeon no longer adorns the forests of S\xc3\xa3o Tom\xc3\xa9. ,loss;hunting; ,protected; ,2,1
Upe,Ducula galeata,Marquesan imperial-pigeon (Ducula galeata),Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Columbiformes,Columbidae,Ducula (1),Length: 50 â 55 cm (2)Wingspan: 70 â 75 cm (2),The main threats to the Marquesan imperial pigeon are illegal hunting habitat loss and modification predation and competition (3) (4). Habitat has been degraded throughout a long period of Polynesian occupancy through clearance for settlements agriculture and forestry fire regimes introduced vegetation and importation of mammalian herbivores including grazing feral stock although cattle have now been eradicated and goats and pigs are decreasing in number (3) (4). It is feared that construction of new roads may lead not only to further habitat loss but also to greater access and considerable disturbance to the last few remaining inaccessible refuges (3). Introduced predators such as cats and rats particularly black rats (<i>Rattus rattus</i>) are also thought to pose a serious potential threat to eggs nestlings juveniles and adults (3) (4). In addition black rats compete for fruit reducing the available food supply for the Marquesan imperial-pigeon (4).,The Marquesan imperial-pigeon is revered in local culture and hunting is prohibited although it clearly continues illegally (3). Fortunately campaigns to increase awareness of this species\xe2\x80\x99 plight appear to be reducing hunting pressure. In addition lobbying by the Ornithological Society of Polynesia (MANU) has successfully stopped the development of a new road and tunnel project that would have claimed parts of this species\xe2\x80\x99 habitat. As a result of these actions the population on Nuku Hiva appears to be stable and may possibly be showing a slow increase (1) (3). ,loss;hunting;pet; , ,3,0
Animalia,Sporophila palustris,Marsh seedeater (Sporophila palustris),Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Emberizidae,Sporophila (1),Length: 10 cm (2),The main threat to this species is collection for the caged bird trade. This practice has severely reduced population numbers and has resulted in the loss of the marsh seedeater from many areas of Argentina and it seriously threatens the survival of populations in Uruguay. Breeding site habitat degradation due to intensive cattle grazing afforestation with eucalyptus and pine pesticide contamination and drainage for agriculture particularly in southeast Uruguay have contributed to population declines. Mechanised agriculture invasive grasses and annual burning are proving detrimental to the marsh seedeater in its wintering habitat (2).,The marsh seedeater is legally protected in Brazil and Uruguay and collection is illegal in Argentina. It breeds in Potrerillo de Santa Teresa Reserve Uruguay and Ibera Provincial Reserve in Argentina. It winters in Emas National Park Brazil and migrating birds are found in several reserves in Paraguay and Argentina. Crucial to the survival of this species is the effective prohibition of trapping in all range states and the removal of incentives to afforest with eucalyptus and pine. It may also benefit from being added to the Convention on Migratory Species (CMS or Bonn Convention) (2). ,loss;invasive; ,protected; ,2,1

The rate of deforestation has increased dramatically in recent decades with a study carried out in 1994 finding that the forests around the R\xc3\xado Utcubamba were being cleared for cash crops and for timber (10). However scientists believe that the marvellous spatuletail may be protected somewhat from deforestation as it lives on the edge of forests and in isolated habitats on steep slopes (2) (7).,In order to conserve this beautiful species of hummingbird as well as other wildlife <strong>endemic</strong> to the region the Huembo Visitor Centre was set up in Pomacochas in the Utcubamba Valley of Peru (2) (12). At the Centre the marvellous spatuletails can be seen at the hummingbird feeding stations year-round (12). ,hunting; ,cites; ,1,1

Only an estimated five percent of the original vegetation of Mauritius still survives (9) and over half the plants the Mauritian flying fox now feeds on are introduced species (3). The Mauritian flying fox is also hunted for food and sport despite being legally protected (1) (3) (7). <i>Pteropus</i> species reproduce relatively slowly reducing the rate at which populations can recover from any losses (6) and the limited range of the Mauritian flying fox makes it particularly vulnerable to catastrophic events. In particular habitat loss as well as opening up the forest to hunters compounds the threat from cyclones which can sweep bats from roosts and devastate vegetation leaving little food for survivors. These effects can be particularly severe where habitat is limited or of poor quality and where bat populations are already under pressure (6) (7) (8).,The Mauritian flying fox has been officially protected in Mauritius since 1993 and is reported to occur in a number of protected areas including the Black River Gorges National Park (1) (8). The species is also protected under wildlife regulations in R\xc3\xa9union (7) and international trade in Mauritian flying foxes should be controlled under its listing on Appendix II of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) (4).

Cardinal de Maurice; Foudi de l'Ile Maurice,Foudia rubra,Mauritius fody (Foudia rubra),Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Ploceidae,Foudia (1),Length: 14 cm (2),Although threatened by the clearance of upland forest the Mauritius fody has also been suddenly lost from areas of intact habitat (2). It is thought that these regions have been affected by particularly high levels of egg predation by both the black rat (<i>Rattus rattus</i>) and the crab-eating macaque (<i>Macaca fascicularis</i>) (6).,At present it would be impossible to eliminate all rats and macaques from the whole of Mauritius and therefore conservation efforts have focussed on establishing populations on offshore predator-free islands (3). The release of captive-bred individuals onto the predator\xe2\x80\x93free island of Ile aux Aigrettes in 2003 has proved successful with the population which is provided with supplementary food increasing to 151 individuals by July 2008 (3). Other conservation measures in place to help protect the Mauritius fody include restoring native forests and establishing plantations of non-invasive exotic trees such as Japanese red cedar (<i>Cryptomeria japonica</i>) which mammalian predators appear to avoid (7). , , ,0,0
Echo parakeet,Psittacula eques,Mauritius parakeet (Psittacula eques),Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Psittaciformes,Psittacidae,Psittacula (1),Length: 35 - 42 cm (2)Male weight: 150 g (2)Female weight: 170 g (2),Much of the natural heritage of Mauritius has been lost and the parakeet itself teetered on the brink of extinction towards the end of the 20th Century. In 1986 only three females were known in the wild and the population as a whole numbered between 8 and 12 birds (4). Much of the native habitat of the island has been destroyed and remaining pockets are vulnerable to storm damage (5). The Mauritius parakeet relies completely on native fauna for both food and nest sites and has been devastated by this habitat decline (4). In addition the introduction of predators such as the crab-eating macaque (<i>Macaca fascicularis</i>) and the black rat (<i>Rattus rattus</i>) has further affected population numbers (5).,The population of Mauritius parakeets today is steadily increasing; in January 2000 the wild population stood at 106 to 126 birds and it is continuing to rise (2) with an estimated 343 wild birds at the end of 2007 (1). This has resulted in the World Conservation Union (IUCN) downlisting the Mauritius parakeet from Critically Endangered to Endangered in 2007 (1). This remarkable achievement has come about by the concerted conservation efforts of a broad-based initiative run in collaboration with the Mauritius Wildlife Foundation (6) Durrell Wildlife Conservation Trust (4) the World Parrot Trust (7) and the Wildlife Preservation Trust of Canada (2). Areas of remaining habitat have been protected and restored by removing introduced plants and animals; Black River National Park has been established to protect the majority of the wild population and is the first national park to be created in Mauritius (4). The breeding success of wild birds has been increased through programmes that supplement their diet and provide a greater number of nesting sites. In addition captive-reared birds are now being released into the wild to bolster numbers (5). This is a wonderful example of how concerted conservation effort can slow the loss of our world\xe2\x80\x99s biodiversity. , ,protected; ,0,1

Canard de Meller,Anas melleri,Mellerâs duck (Anas melleri),Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Anseriformes,Anatidae,Anas (1),Length: 55 â 68 cm (2),The wetland habitats of Madagascar on which this duck depends have suffered widespread modification since humans arrived on the island around 1500 years ago (5). Deforestation of the surrounding lands has increased siltation in the rivers and lakes which along with drainage pollution the conversion of marshes to rice-paddies and the introduction of exotic plants and fishes has resulted in the reduction of Madagascar\xe2\x80\x99s native wetland inhabitants (5). Introduced large fish such as largemouth bass and snakehead are thought to have led to the Meller\xe2\x80\x99s duck deserting some areas (4). The enormous impact these threats could potentially have on Meller\xe2\x80\x99s ducks is illustrated by the plight of two waterbirds that once occurred in Lake Alaotra: the now extinct Delacour's grebe (<i>Tachybaptus rufolavatus</i>) and the recently re-discovered Madagascar pochard (<i>Aythya innotata</i>) (5) (6). Compounding the threat of habitat loss and degradation is hunting; around 450 ducks are killed each year from Lake Alaotra for food which constitutes an incredible 18 percent of the global population (2).,Meller\xe2\x80\x99s duck occurs in at least seven protected areas in Madagascar (2) and there are some laws in place to control hunting of this species. However these laws are often not enforced and hunting of this endangered bird continues (3). A captive population of Meller\xe2\x80\x99s ducks exists at Durrell Wildlife Conservation Trust Jersey where over 150 young have been successfully reared. This population not only acts as a safeguard should the species become extinct in the wild but it also allows extensive research to be undertaken gaining valuable information which may be used to formulate a conservation plan for the wild population (3). In the wild improved enforcement of hunting regulations and the development of protected areas that incorporate nesting sites are considered essential actions to ensure the survival of Meller\xe2\x80\x99s duck (4) (5). ,loss;hunting;pollution; ,protected; ,3,1

The region in Mexico the blindcat inhabits is facing rapid population growth resulting in increased pressure on groundwater resources.  Interviews with local people indicate that the water tables have declined in recent decades which reduces the amount of available habitat for the Mexican blindcat.  Growing human populations also results in increased pollution which could contaminate the groundwater (6) further threatening the existence of this fish.,Despite the threats it faces the Mexican blindcat may inhabit underground waters that are undiscovered or inaccessible to humans and therefore the total number of individuals could potentially be large (6).  Further research to determine the population size and conservation status of the Mexican blindcat is required to inform future conservation actions to protect this peculiar species. ,pollution; , ,1,0

The main threat to the species is believed to come from a decrease in its food supply due to habitat clearance and the exploitation of agaves for the production of alcoholic drinks such as tequila (1) (3) (6) (9) (10). This harvest poses a particular threat as the agaves are harvested just before blooming preventing the plant from flowering and since agaves grow for 10 to 20 years flower only once and then die it can also prevent the agaves from reproducing (1) (6). The Mexican long-nosed bat\xe2\x80\x99s dependence on a continuous supply of food plants along its migratory routes also means that loss of the plants in any single area could have negative consequences for this species\xa0(9).,The only known <strong>colonial</strong> roosting site of the Mexican long-nosed bat in the United States is protected within the Big Bend National Park Texas (1) (3) (6) and the species is listed as Endangered on the US Endangered Species List (11). A Recovery Plan is in place for the species (10) and recommendations for its conservation include the protection of roost sites and foraging habitat public education ecological studies maintaining and restoring habitat and food plants along its migratory routes and population monitoring (1) (3) (6) (10). Efforts are also underway to locate further roosting sites (6).

Mexican prairie marmot,Cynomys mexicanus,Mexican prairie dog (Cynomys mexicanus),Animalia,Chordata,Mammalia,Rodentia,Sciuridae,Cynomys (1),Total length: 39 cm (2)Tail length: 9 cm (2)Male weight: 1.2 kg (2)Female weight: 0.9 kg (2),The main threat facing this species has been loss of suitable habitat as a result of expansion of agriculture and livestock farming (1). As the species is often perceived as an agricultural pest Mexican prairie dog towns have been exterminated by deliberate poisoning despite the fact that the species is fully protected against deliberate killing by Mexican law (5). The species has also been hunted for food in the past (4).,The Mexican prairie dog is classified as Endangered by the IUCN Red List 2003 and is protected against international trade by its listing under Appendix I of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) (1) (3). <i>Protecion de la Fauna Mexicana </i>recently carried out a conservation project targeted at the Mexican prairie dog funded by <i>Fondo Mexicano para la Conservacion de la Naturaleza Mexico. </i>This project set aside 114 hectares of prairie dog colony to be protected and managed in ways that benefit the species. In parallel an environmental education programme was carried out in the area to spread the word of the importance of the species and its perilous status. Essential research into pasture management techniques that are compatible with the survival of this species was undertaken during the project. The only hope for the survival of the Mexican prairie dog is that methods can be found to reconcile cattle-keeping and the native fauna of the area (6). ,loss; ,cites;protected; ,1,2

Animalia,Rheomys mexicanus,Mexican water mouse (Rheomys mexicanus),Animalia,Chordata,Mammalia,Rodentia,Cricetidae,Rheomys (1),c. 88 g (3),In general water mice are considered very difficult to capture and so the exact status of many species is unknown (4) (5). However the Mexican water mouse is believed to be rare and to occupy a limited and severely fragmented range and has been recorded from only four locations making it particularly vulnerable (1) (2). The main threats to the species are deforestation which is reported to be occurring throughout its range and water pollution. The Mexican water mouse is reliant on areas of pristine habitat and any kind of water pollution including household pollution from the washing of clothes is a potential threat to its survival (1).,The Mexican water mouse is classed as \xe2\x80\x98Rare\xe2\x80\x99 by the Mexican government (8) but there are not known to be any specific conservation measures in place for the species. More research is needed to better understand this little-known rodent and to determine the status of its populations and its specialised habitat before appropriate conservation measures can be put in place (1). ,pollution; , ,1,0

Regrettably such activities even take place within so-called protected areas (1).\xa0 Both gold mining and illegal rum production are also degrading suitable habitat in certain parts of the sifaka\xe2\x80\x99s range (1). Compounding the threat of habitat loss is the threat of hunting; being a large lemur it is an attractive target for hunters. Luckily hunting is largely restricted to the northern part of Milne-Edwards\xe2\x80\x99 sifaka\xe2\x80\x99s range as taboos are prevalent among local people in southern parts of its range (1). \xa0,Milne-Ewards\xe2\x80\x99 sifaka occurs in two national parks Andringitra and Ranomafana (1) although as mentioned above this does not offer this threatened lemur complete protection.\xa0 It is also listed on Appendix I of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) meaning that international trade in this species is prohibited (3).\xa0 It has been suggested that unprotected areas of forest that harbour important populations of this species should be protected (1) but increased enforcement of such protected areas is also likely to be required if this Endangered species is to survive. ,loss;hunting; ,cites;protected; ,2,2

The Minor\xe2\x80\x99s chameleon is currently listed in Appendix II of CITES limiting trade in this species (3). Generally the greatest threat to Madagascar\xe2\x80\x99s chameleons is considered to be habitat loss as primary vegetation is cleared for conversion to subsistence agriculture (1) but Minor\xe2\x80\x99s chameleon fortunately appears to tolerate disturbed environments better than most other species (4). However due to a lack of basic information in its ecology we do not know whether plantations provide suitable breeding habitats. This lack of knowledge and its relatively restricted range in terms of habitat and elevation and use of native forest make it a species worthy of conservation concern (1).,As with most other Madagascan <em>Furcifer</em> chameleon species Minor\xe2\x80\x99s chameleon was banned from export in 1994 (7). It is not currently known from within any of Madagascar\xe2\x80\x99s protected areas (2) although part of its range in Itremo is currently in the process of being protected. More research into Minor\xe2\x80\x99s chameleon is necessary to clarify its distribution and tolerance of habitat modification (1). ,loss;environment;pet; ,protected; ,3,1

The threat of habitat loss is compounded by the rise of poaching of this species for the pet trade and food (1) (9).,The mitred leaf monkey is protected by national law in Indonesia (1) and is listed under Appendix II of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species\xa0(CITES) (10).

In the building industry it is often sold as \xe2\x80\x98Parana pine\xe2\x80\x99 (5). In addition populations have declined as a result of habitat destruction and unsustainable levels of fire. During 2000 and 2001 thousands of hectares were destroyed by fire in southern Chile (7).,The monkey puzzle was declared a National Monument in Chile in 1976 a status that prohibits logging (4). The species is also protected in Argentina although logging pressure continues outside of National Parks (4). Conservation recommendations include the development of new protected areas in the coastal mountain range and the mapping of existing populations (7).

The major pressure on population numbers is habitat loss due to increasing agricultural land forestry operations and deforestation for human settlement (1). Despite being protected under Indonesian law mountain anoas are known to be shot by the military possibly because they are thought to be aggressive when startled and capable of harming humans. Hunting anoas for the meat fur and horns still takes place even in protected sites such as nature reserves (1),Ongoing status surveys and genetic research are intended for use in clarifying the taxonomic ranking of mountain and lowland anoas which is necessary before captive breeding of these species can take place. Whilst the mountain anoa has been protected in Indonesia since 1931 protected areas are poorly managed and enforcement is clearly an issue even within the military (1) (4). ,loss;hunting; ,captive breeding;protected; ,2,2

It has also reduced in range and remaining populations are fragmented making them particularly vulnerable (1) (10). The main threats to the mountain nyala come from human activity within its range with increasing human and livestock populations putting ever-increasing pressure on the species through illegal hunting competition with cattle predation by domestic dogs and habitat clearance for agriculture grazing firewood harvesting and settlement (1) (2) (4) (10) (11). The species has been extensively hunted for its meat and horns and there is continued pressure from the trophy hunting industry to increase hunting quotas (1) (4).,Despite being fully protected by law enforcement is generally absent and the mountain nyala is only effectively protected within a small area in the north of Bale Mountains National Park which is estimated to hold a large proportion of the total population (1) (9) (14). A smaller protected area Kuni-Muktar Wildlife Sanctuary was established for the species in 1990 but severe poaching deforestation cultivation and erosion were thought to have eliminated the mountain nyala there (1) (10) until the presence of a small population was confirmed in 2003 (4). No mountain nyalas are currently kept in captivity (2) (10) (12) and it has been suggested that a self-sustaining captive population be established as an insurance against further losses in the wild (1) (10). ,hunting;pet; ,protected; ,2,1
Andean tapir; Woolly tapir,Tapirus pinchaque,Mountain tapir (Tapirus pinchaque),Animalia,Chordata,Mammalia,Perissodactyla,Tapiridae,Tapirus (1),150 kg (3),The major threats to the mountain tapir are destruction and fragmentation of the p\xc3\xa1ramo and <strong>cloud forest</strong> habitats coupled with illegal hunting for food (2) (3) and the use of body parts in folk medicine (6). The introduction of livestock to the area may have significant effects through transmitting diseases and attracting increased numbers of predators (2).,The mountain tapir occurs in a number of protected reserves in Colombia and Ecuador and is protected throughout most of the current range (2). A small number of individuals currently live in captivity at a handful of zoos (2). The Tapir Preservation Fund was set up in 1996; the aims of this organisation include the promotion of the conservation and study of tapirs. (9). It has been highlighted that local people must be involved in and benefit economically from programmes to conserve this species if they are to be successful in preventing poaching and habitat loss (6). ,fragmentation;hunting;disease; ,protected; ,3,1

The mountain viper has only been observed in five locations and is therefore vulnerable to over-collection. As with other species of viper the mountain viper is also subject to persecution by humans and may be intentionally killed (1).,The mountain viper is not known to occur in any protected areas but is afforded some protection by its listing on Appendix II of the Bern Convention (1) (6). Further research into the ecology and distribution of the mountain viper is needed in order to understand how to best conserve it and any future trade in this species needs to be carefully regulated (1). ,pet; ,protected; ,1,1

Small populations restricted to tiny areas are always incredibly vulnerable to the impacts of any threats that may befall them. The most immediate threat the Narcondam hornbill faces is habitat deterioration (2). In 1969 a small police outpost was established on the island leading to the loss of forest to create the post a plantation of fruit trees and vegetable plots (2) (7) and further trees are cut each year for firewood and intermittent maintenance purposes (7). Goats were also introduced to the island and their grazing has now eliminated most of the undergrowth and seedlings (2) significantly reducing natural forest regeneration (7). Feral cats also introduced are now abundant but their impact on the Narcondam hornbill is not yet known (2) and around 25 to 40 Narcondam hornbills are thought to be hunted each year although this is not believed to be a serious threat given the rate of breeding (2) (7). Nature brings its own problems for the Narcondam hornbill; the small restricted population is susceptible to both disease and natural disasters such as cyclones which can fell large and important nesting trees (7).,Narcondam Island has been declared a wildlife sanctuary and the police personnel on the island have been given strict instructions not to hunt the threatened hornbill (7). However to ensure the long-term survival of the Narcondam hornbill stricter conservation measures are required. As a priority all introduced species especially goats should be removed from the island (2) and cooking fuel should be provided to the island\xe2\x80\x99s inhabitants to eliminate their need for fuelwood (7). To lessen the threat of natural disasters it has been recommended that the possibility of establishing a second population on a nearby island should be investigated (7). ,loss;disease; , ,2,0

The behaviour of massing in predictably located <strong>spawning</strong> aggregations has meant that these fish are easy targets caught by hook and line traps and spearguns (6). In the 1990s however fisheries documented a worrying decline in the size of catches and aggregations are no longer observed in Puerto Rico Bermuda or the United States Virgin Islands (3).,Following a massive lobbying effort by conservationists the Nassau grouper has finally received some of the protection it requires if numbers are going to recover from past exploitation (3). <strong>Spawning</strong> sites are protected in the Cayman Islands and fishing is banned in Belize during the spawning season (1). Other countries in the area however have been slow to introduce protection measures and extensive lobbying continues (1). , ,protected; ,0,1

Now present in only 20 percent of its former range Nelson\xe2\x80\x99s antelope squirrel is extremely vulnerable to further habitat loss. In public owned reserves this rare species is protected from further declines but in private owned areas where the future management is uncertain its habitat is still threatened. The use of insecticides on agricultural pests has also been identified as a further threat to Nelson\xe2\x80\x99s antelope squirrel due to loss of prey while the historical use of rodenticides for the control of ground squirrels may have also contributed to the decline (1) (6). \xa0,Nelson\xe2\x80\x99s antelope squirrel has already benefited from several conservation measures aiming to protect its vulnerable habitat.\xa0 Several reserves have been created within the San Joaquin valley an area defined by a high degree of <strong>endemism</strong> including the Carrizo Plain National Monument and the Elkhorn Plain Ecological Preserve. This has offered Nelson\xe2\x80\x99s antelope squirrel some sanctuary; however several sites with substantial populations still receive no form of protection. Foremost in the drive to save this species should be the establishment of further protected areas in the Panoche and Kettleman hills and on the San Joaquin valley floor (1). Furthermore livestock grazing of natural grasslands should be limited while further surveys and monitoring of the density of this curious species is also required (6). ,loss; ,protected; ,1,1

Feral cats and rats caused a rapid decline on Stewart Island (4) (5) and predation remains the greatest threat on the North Island (4). Habitat loss and human disturbance during breeding have also had a dramatic impact on populations and continue to pose serious threats (3). In particular housing industrial and tourism developments on the North Island combined with encroachment of dune-stabilising weeds have reduced habitat (4). Growing recreational use of the coastline is also set to increasingly impact on breeding roosting and feeding habitats (5). Indeed four-wheel drive vehicles picnickers and dogs can trample and disturb nests or draw defensive adults away from incubating their eggs (2). Additionally storms and very high tides can destroy nests (4) (6) and very few young survive to fledging age (2).,In 1993 the New Zealand Government\xe2\x80\x99s Department of Conservation published a national recovery plan for the New Zealand dotterel and management initiatives were implemented (3). On the North Island trapping of potential predators gull control and the implementation of signs and wardens to reduce human disturbance have all helped improve breeding success (4). Control of cats and rodents in four important breeding sites on Stewart Island has also helped increase survival in southern New Zealand dotterel populations which thankfully appear to be growing (4) (5). Captive breeding trials with the more abundant northern New Zealand dotterel have been undertaken partially as an experiment to see if individuals breed well in case such a programme should be needed in the future to bolster the low numbers of wild southern New Zealand dotterels. Chicks have been raised successfully in these trials highlighting captive breeding as a viable means of preserving the survival of the species should such methods ever be needed (4). ,loss; ,captive breeding; ,1,1

Although this decline is thought to be associated with the impacts of Hurricane Iniki which hit the island in 1992 numerous other factors could also be implicated. Artificial lighting on the breeding islands such as street and resort lights is affecting large numbers of Newell\xe2\x80\x99s shearwaters. Lights disorientate fledglings as they depart the island for life at sea causing them to crash into powerlines communication towers or other structures or fall to the ground exhausted. Once on the ground the small birds are vulnerable to cars cats dogs starvation and dehydration resulting in thousands perishing each year (4).,Several conservation actions have been initiated for this Endangered bird. In 1978 a campaign to rescue and rehabilitate fallen fledglings began (4). Entitled Save our Shearwaters this campaign recovers and releases around 1500 disorientated shearwaters each year (2) (4). Since the early 1980s efforts have been made to reduce the amount of glaring lights that attract and disorientate shearwaters (4). In 2006 a law was passed which requires all non-essential lights to be turned off or shielded between September and December on Kaua\xe2\x80\x99i when young shearwaters leave their nests (6) and recently hoods (to prevent lights shining into the sky) have been installed on all lights on the island (4). ,loss;fishing;overfishing; , ,3,0

In addition human expansion has meant that there has been an increase in cattle farming resulting in competition for the Nile lechwe\xe2\x80\x99s resources (6). As a result of these threats the Nile lechwe population is estimated to have declined by more than 50 percent over recent years (1). In the Sudd wetlands and Zeraf Reserve the situation for wildlife is likely to worsen as a result of oil exploration and exploitation in the region (1).,In Sudan the Nile lechwe occurs in three protected areas: Zeraf Fannyikang and Shambe and in Ethiopia the species occurs in Gambella National Park (1). However the benefits of these nominally protected areas are limited as the Nile lechwe shares these areas with huge herds of cattle (1). There are currently thought to be over 400 Nile lechwe held in captivity in zoos across the world (7) which can act as insurance should the worst happen to the wild population and allows an opportunity to learn more about this threatened antelope. ,hunting;pet; ,protected; ,2,1

As the Nilgiri blue robin is already living close to the maximum altitudes at which it is able to survive climate change also has the potential to negatively impact populations of the Nilgiri blue robin (2).,The Nilgiri blue robin is found in Mukurthi National Park. Proposed conservation measures for this threatened bird include regular monitoring of remaining populations and campaigning for a moratorium on the conversion on natural forest to plantations in the Nilgiris (2) while efforts are also underway to restore forest in some areas of the Nilgiri blue robin\xe2\x80\x99s range and to promote community-based conservation initiatives (2) (3). These efforts will not only benefit this vulnerable bird but also many other inhabitants of the Western Ghats.\xa0\xa0 , , ,0,0

Nilgiri ibex,Nilgiritragus hylocrius,Nilgiri tahr (Nilgiritragus hylocrius),Animalia,Chordata,Mammalia,Cetartiodactyla,Bovidae,Nilgiritragus (1),Male weight: 80 - 100 kg (2)Shoulder height: 100 cm (2),The precise distribution of this species in the past is not well documented but the range and numbers of these goat antelope were more widespread than they are today (2). Habitat destruction and sport hunting especially by European colonists have decimated tahr numbers (2). The Nilgiri tahr is now fully protected in India but poaching remains a threat today (2).,The Nilgiri tahr has increased in numbers in recent decades thanks to strict protection within one of India's most effective National Parks; Eravikulam National Park was established in 1978 and covers around 97 square kilometres (2). The area was declared as a sanctuary in 1975 and subsequently elevated to the status of a National Park in 1978 taking into consideration the importance of the area in terms of conservation (4). The 2003 census of the park recorded 750 individuals (4). Current conservation objectives include further study of the ecology and behaviour of this fascinating goat antelope and the investigation of the possibility of <strong>re-introductions</strong> (2). Within the Eravikulam National Park and the grasslands of the Tamil Nadu the Niligiri tahr may have a relatively secure future but elsewhere in the Western Ghats populations are extremely fragmented and highly vulnerable (4). ,hunting;poaching; , ,2,0

Spotted greenshank,Tringa guttifer,Nordmannâs greenshank (Tringa guttifer),Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Charadriiformes,Scolopacidae,Tringa (1),Length: 29 â 32 cm (2),The major threats to this species include the development of coastal wetlands for industry and aquaculture and habitat degradation due to grazing reindeer in Russia as well as pollution. Hunting and human disturbance have also contributed to population declines (2).,This species benefits from protection in several areas in Russia as well as from protected and non-hunting areas along the migration route including the Yellow River Delta Yancheng and Chongming Dongtan in China Mai Po in Hong Kong Ko Libong in Thailand Peam Krasop in Cambodia and Zuan Thuy in Vietnam. Surveys are planned for the southwest of Okhotsk as well as between the Ul\xe2\x80\x99beya River and Cape Onatsevich Russia. Further research into the status and necessary conservation actions is needed at potentially important wintering grounds in the Ayeyarwady Delta (formerly Irrawaddy) in Burma. Key actions to be completed also include the promotion of the conservation of coastal wetlands the prohibition of hunting of all shorebirds in the breeding grounds of Nordmann\xe2\x80\x99s greenshank and full legal protection throughout its range (2). ,hunting;pollution; ,protected; ,2,1
Baleine De Biscaye; Baleine Des Basques,Eubalaena glacialis,North Atlantic right whale (Eubalaena glacialis),Animalia,Chordata,Mammalia,Cetartiodactyla,Balaenidae,Eubalaena (1),up to 70 tonnes (3),With as of 2008 between just 300 and 350 North Atlantic right whales remaining this species\xe2\x80\x99 existence lies in an extremely precarious situation (1). Years of whaling starting in the 11th century and becoming a modern industrial practice in the early 20th century have left North Atlantic right whale stocks seriously depleted in the western Atlantic (2) and virtually extinct in the eastern Atlantic (1). They were killed in their thousands for their valuable oil and <strong>baleen</strong> (2) until commercial whaling was prohibited by the International Whaling Commission in 1935 (1).,Since the North Atlantic right whale was protected from hunting in 1935 by the International Whaling Commission (IWC) and also protected in Canada which is not a member of the IWC (1) the most important conservation need for this species is the reduction or elimination of deaths and injuries from ship collisions and entanglement in fishing gear (3). ,loss;fishing; ,protected; ,2,1
Animalia,Apteryx mantelli,North Island brown kiwi (Apteryx mantelli),Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Apterygiformes,Apterygidae,Apteryx (1),Length: 40 cm (2)Male weight: 2.2 kg (3)Female weight: 2.8 kg (3),North Island brown kiwis have undergone a dramatic decline and as much as 90 percent of the population may have been lost since the start of the 20th Century (2). Research since the early 1990s has revealed that kiwi numbers in unmanaged areas of the North Island have been declining by about four percent a year (5). These birds evolved on an island that lacked terrestrial mammalian predators and have been devastated by the introduction of species such as dogs stoats and cats (5); a single dog is known to have killed roughly 500 birds in one six-week period (2). Around 95 percent of chicks never reach sexual maturity primarily as a result of predation but also as the results of accidents such as falls from cliffs drowning and encounters with traps or poison set for possums (3) (5). The loss of much of New Zealand's habitat has exacerbated these threats by isolating surviving populations and predators in fragmented pockets of remaining habitat (5).,The North Island brown kiwi is the subject of a concerted and wide-ranging conservation programme managed by the New Zealand Department of Conservation and Bank of New Zealand Save the Kiwi (3) (4). A number of different strategies are being employed including the protection of wild nests and chicks by trapping predators the artificial incubation of eggs and chicks in predator-free environments until they are big enough and old enough to cope with stoats and cats and breeding of captive birds for release into the wild (3) (4). In the species' stronghold of Northland the Whangarei Kiwi Sanctuary has been established whilst on the Coromandel Penninsula Moehau Kiwi Sanctuary protects the individuals located there (5). Where there is active management of populations and predator control North Island brown kiwi numbers have shown dramatic increases (5). It is hoped that the many conservation measures in place will help to preserve New Zealand's national bird for generations to come. ,loss; , ,1,0
Animalia,Eubalaena japonica,North Pacific right whale (Eubalaena japonica),Animalia,Chordata,Mammalia,Cetartiodactyla,Balaenidae,Eubalaena (1),40 â 80 tons (2),Historically the North Pacific right whale was abundant throughout the North Pacific; however today only a relict population exists and the eastern sub-population is close to extinction. Intensive commercial whaling began in 1835 when European and American whaling industries significantly reduced populations to critically low numbers. International protection in 1935 by the International Whaling Commission (IWC) allowed the North Pacific right whale some respite from the intensive hunting pressure and the species began to slowly recover. However illegal whaling by the Soviet Union primarily in the early 1960s killed 372 individuals in the eastern North Pacific and an unknown number in the western population. This together with a catch of 23 whales for scientific purposes removed a substantial proportion of the population and the species\xe2\x80\x99 ability to recover to pre-whaling numbers was severely compromised (5) (9).\xa0\xa0\xa0,Due to an extremely small population size estimated at only a few hundred in the western North Pacific and only tens of animals in the distinct eastern population the North Pacific right whale urgently requires research to identify and mitigate potential threats (1) (5). The North Pacific right whale\xe2\x80\x99s breeding and calving grounds need to be located and protected while further surveys are required to provide insight into the species\xe2\x80\x99 habitat use and migration timing. The North Pacific right whale continues to receive full international protection but it is unclear if populations are recovering (1). ,hunting;fishing; ,protected; ,2,1

The main threats to the species include gravel and water extraction water pollution dam construction the destruction of <strong>spawning</strong> areas and the introduction of exotic fish such as pike (<em>Esox lucius</em>) which may act as predators competitors or vectors of disease (1) (2) (3) (6) (7).,The Northern Iberian spined-loach is listed as Vulnerable in the Spanish Red Book (3) and as Endangered in the Portuguese Red Book (7).

Pinto abalone,Haliotis kamtschatkana,Northern abalone (Haliotis kamtschatkana),Animalia,Mollusca,Gastropoda,Archaeogastropoda,Haliotidae,Haliotis (1),Length: up to 14 cm (2),Abalone have been harvested for hundreds of years for their meat and their decorative shells but their remote environment previously limited the impact this had on populations (2) (3). However the introduction of SCUBA equipment in the 1960s meant that abalone could be collected in far greater numbers and led to the rampant over-harvesting and drastic decline of this species to the extent that collecting this species was eventually banned over much of its range (2) (5). However illegal poaching which is a lucrative enterprise motivated by high demand and elevated market prices due to the species\xe2\x80\x99 scarcity continues to pose a serious threat to the northern abalone (3). Furthermore there are law enforcement problems due to North America having large areas of uninhabited coastline in which constant monitoring is near impossible (1).,There are now a number of conservation measures underway to protect the northern abalone. A total ban on harvesting this species came into force in 1990 in British Columbia and partial bans and catch quotas now also exist elsewhere. A National Recovery Strategy and National Recovery Action Plan have been created in Canada which focus on improving law enforcement raising public support through communication campaigns conducting further research on the species and ongoing monitoring of its status and population trends. Although supplementing northern abalone populations could help accelerate its recovery reintroductions of hatchery-raised juveniles has proved costly and fairly ineffective in the past and therefore is not recommended as a valuable conservation tool in this instance (1). ,poaching;environment;pet; , ,3,0
Animalia,Bettongia tropica,Northern bettong (Bettongia tropica),Animalia,Chordata,Mammalia,Diprotodontia,Potoroidae,Bettongia (1),1 â 1.5 kg (2),Numbers of this rare species are thought to be declining (1). This fall in numbers has been attributed to several different threats in particular the alteration of the northern bettong\xe2\x80\x99s preferred habitat as a result of a change in fire regimes in the last half century. Less frequent fires have allowed rainforest to encroach into the species\xe2\x80\x99 eucalypt forest habitat and along with invasive <strong>feral</strong> pigs this has affected the supply of its primary food source truffles. Over-grazing has also substantially diminished vegetation which the bettong requires for both shelter and food such as cockatoo grass. Furthermore predation by domestic dogs is of concern particularly in areas where humans live close to bettong habitat (1) (4).,Some of the northern bettong\xe2\x80\x99s range lies within protected areas including the Lamb Range State Forest Wet Tropics World Heritage Area and the Davies Creek National Park (1) which should hopefully offer some protection from the many threats it faces. In addition a recovery plan for the northern bettong has been established which includes plans for the maintenance of habitat a restriction on forest clearing activities the monitoring and management of fire and grazing regimes and the monitoring and control of <strong>feral</strong> pigs and predators (11). It is hoped that the recovery plan will improve the conservation status of the northern bettong not only by maintaining the existing wild populations but also by creating new ones. ,invasive; ,protected; ,1,1

Factors thought to be contributing include the detrimental effects of introduced plants such as blackberry (<i>Rubus fruticosus</i>) and monkey musk (<i>Mimulus moschatus</i>) which smother the breeding sites of the frog as well as the trampling effects of feral pigs and introduced horses (1). Habitat loss erosion and human disturbance are also thought to have contributed (3). A pathogen called Chytrid fungus has been detected in museum specimens and is now the major suspect for the cause of the decline (1) (4).,Much of the habitat occupied by northern corroboree frogs is within reserves providing protection for the frogs and their habitat. Research into the behaviour biology and range of the frog is being undertaken and population monitoring is in place (1). ,loss; , ,1,0
Helmeted curassow,Pauxi pauxi,Northern helmeted curassow (Pauxi pauxi),Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Galliformes,Cracidae,Pauxi (1),Length: 91 cm (2),The northern helmeted curassow has undergone a relatively rapid decline as the result of indiscriminate hunting and long-term destruction fragmentation and alteration of its habitat (2). Sadly wherever curassows occur they tend to be considered prime game species due to their large size and succulent flesh (4). This species has also at least formerly been illegally hunted for use of its bony casque to make traditional jewellery (2) (6).\xa0Essential forest habitat has been destroyed in both Venezuela and Colombia for conversion into cattle ranches at lower altitudes and for narcotics cultivation higher up (2). Furthermore opening up of forest habitat to human development only serves to increase the bird\xe2\x80\x99s vulnerability to the pressures of hunting and the limited range and low reproductive rate of this species only compound such threats (4).,Almost all remaining forests in northern Venezuela are now legally protected and records of this rare bird exist from 18 national parks but this has failed to safeguard it from the threat of poachers which continue to illegally hunt it within these areas (2) (6). The situation is worse in Colombia with the species being recorded within only one \xe2\x80\x98protected area\xe2\x80\x99 El Cocuy National Park Arauca which is also ineffectively protected (2). This rare curassow is legally protected in Venezuela and an education programme has been established to raise awareness of the plight of the bird and its habitat (2). Captive breeding and reintroduction of the bird have also been proposed for Venezuela as a means of restoring natural populations where they have declined (2) (7). However until legislation against hunting is strictly enforced and national parks are adequately protected reintroduced individuals may have a poor chance of survival. Thus conservation efforts should focus on protecting existing populations and the ever diminishing habitat on which they rely. ,fragmentation;hunting; ,captive breeding;protected; ,2,2
Animalia,Notomys aquilo,Northern hopping mouse (Notomys aquilo),Animalia,Chordata,Mammalia,Rodentia,Muridae,Notomys (1),25 â 50 g (3),The threats facing this species are not clear at present. Possible threats include predation by feral cats as well as habitat degradation caused by strip-mining for manganese (1). The invasion of foreign weed species and grazing by livestock may also threaten the northern hopping mouse by reducing the availability of its preferred plant food (3).\xa0,The northern hopping mouse is not found within any conservation reserves (6); however the Arnhem Land region is managed for conservation by the Dhimurru Land Management Aboriginal Corporation (5). In 2004 a recovery plan for this species was created by Australia\xe2\x80\x99s Department of the Environment and Heritage. The plan outlines measures to protect this species including management to reduce the number of feral cats and protecting Groote Eylandt to limit the chance of any new threat being introduced (3). It also recommended that further research is undertaken on this species to shed more light on its ecological requirements which will help inform future management plans (3).\xa0 , , ,0,0

Animalia,Eudyptes moseleyi,Northern rockhopper penguin (Eudyptes moseleyi),Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Sphenisciformes,Spheniscidae,Eudyptes (1),3 kg (2),A recent study of the northern rockhopper penguin population (published in 2009) has shown that well over one million birds have been lost from the breeding colonies on the islands of Tristan da Cunha and Gough. While this equates to declines of over 90 percent on both islands on Gough this loss has occurred in just 45 years whereas on the main island of Tristan it has taken almost three times longer. The reasons for the swift decline on Gough are currently unknown but the penguin may be suffering increased levels of predation as well as competition for food from the rapidly rising population of Subantarctic Fur Seals <i>Arctocephalus tropicalis</i> (5). Other factors may include increasing disturbance and pollution introduced predators reduced food supplies due to overfishing and climate change (4).,While the northern rockhopper penguin population is being regularly monitored in order to safeguard against further declines it is imperative that the causes of the population crash be determined (4) (5). This should be targeted at all possible factors including studies of interactions with commercial fisheries the impact of the introduced predatory house mouse on chick survival on Gough Island (4) and the effects of fur seal predation and competition (5). Without the implementation of appropriate conservation measures this charismatic species will continue to nose dive towards extinction (5). ,loss;fishing;overfishing;pet;pollution; , ,5,0

As a result annual reproductive success plummeted due to egg breakage high temperatures and flooding in temporary pools. Introduced predators pose an additional threat with stoats (<i>Mustela erminea</i>) and cats known to take eggs and chicks at Taiaroa Head. Albatrosses are notoriously vulnerable to becoming entangled in fishing equipment whilst feeding on baited hooks or catch and mortality due to longline fishing activities may pose a future threat to this species (2).,All populations of the northern royal albatross are monitored annually and predator control initiatives at Taiaroa Head during the breeding season have dramatically improved annual reproductive success rates. Feral cattle rabbits and mice have all been eradicated from Enderby Island and Taiaroa Head and Enderby Island are established as nature reserves (2). The northern royal albatross is also listed on Annex 1 of the Agreement on the Conservation of Albatrosses and Petrels (ACAP) a multilateral agreement which seeks to conserve albatrosses and petrels by coordinating international activity to mitigate known threats to these magnificent seabirds (4). ,fishing; , ,1,0

This removes dead and fallen trees which numbats need for shelter and termites need for resources (4). Another factor could be the suppression of Aboriginal fire regimes after the movement of Aboriginal people away from their traditional lands following the European settlement of Australia. Aboriginal fires were small and controlled allowing regeneration each year and reducing the incidence of larger bush fires in the hot summer. Now these large bush fires are a greater threat and more widespread causing extensive damage to the numbats\xe2\x80\x99 habitat shelter and food sources (4) (6).,The numbat is Western Australia\xe2\x80\x99s mammal emblem a status which gives it widespread recognition and may well have saved it from extinction (4). Following the numbat\xe2\x80\x99s decline this species has been listed as Vulnerable on the IUCN Red List (1) and Vulnerable on the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 (EPBC Act) (3). Active intervention by the Australian Department of Environment and Conservation (DEC) has fortunately improved the numbat\xe2\x80\x99s chances of survival. DEC has implemented fox control in the areas where numbats are found and is establishing new populations in various nature reserves and forests (5). Conservation programs are also re-introducing the numbat to areas from which they have disappeared and are radio-tracking individuals to monitor their fate (8). Regular fox baiting is also carried out at Perup Dryandra and at re-introduction sites and numbats are currently being bred for release at Perth Zoo (4) (7). The numbat\xe2\x80\x99s habitat is said to be secure at present though this species will certainly need constant protection and continued <strong>re-introductions</strong> in order to recover (5) (8). , , ,0,0

Whilst much of the area in which it inhabits is inaccessible and unexplored in other parts deforestation occurs at an alarmingly high rate as forest is cleared for crops such as marijuana and coffee (5). <strong>Slash-and-burn</strong> agriculture in the area is also increasing catalysed by the recent paving of a highway that traverses the region (6).,The ochre-fronted antpitta has been found near the Alto Mayo Protected Forest (2) but this area is itself critically threatened due to deforestation for agriculture and grazing illegal extraction of wildlife high levels of human migration and indiscriminate hunting (7). The American Bird Conservancy together with Asociaci\xc3\xb3n Ecosistemas Andinos (ECOAN) is running a project to conserve threatened birds and other wildlife around Abra Patricia (a site within the antpitta\xe2\x80\x99s range) by establishing a new private reserve and field station (6).

Furthermore both its range and population are undergoing continuing declines due to introduced predators and loss of forest to logging dam construction and associated road-building and agriculture (3). Predation by mongooses originally introduced to kill the poisonous habu snake is thought to be having a significant impact on this bird along with possible predation by feral dogs and cats (3) (4) (6).,The Okinawa rail is legally protected in Japan. Yonaha-dake and parts of Mount Ibu and Mount Nishime are designated as protected areas and in 1996 Yambaru was designated as a national park. Since 1970 conservation organisations have been campaigning for the protection of Okinawa\xe2\x80\x99s forests and have bought some sites on Mount Yonaha to establish private wildlife reserves (3). The Ministry of the Environment of Japan has recently drawn up a protection plan for this rare bird which includes an artificial breeding programme and culling of the bird\xe2\x80\x99s predators (6).

Many groups are found in isolated relict forest patches surrounded by cattle ranches and agricultural grasslands limiting the species\xe2\x80\x99 natural dispersal. Hunting pressure also exists throughout its range as some indigenous groups of people still rely on subsistence hunting of primates and its skin and fur may be used to make rope and thread. Hunting is particularly intense during the annual Brazil nut harvest when workers obtain most of their food from hunting (6). The Olalla Brothers\xe2\x80\x99 titi may also be captured for use as bait in fishing and cat hunting or as pets (1).,Although not found in any protected areas the Olalla Brothers\xe2\x80\x99 titi has received some protection from landowners that prohibit hunting on their land. However this endangered monkey is still highly vulnerable to encroaching agriculture and urbanisation and it is imperative that its habitat receives some form of legal protection (1).

Braunâs bush-shrike,Laniarius brauni,Orange-breasted bush-shrike (Laniarius brauni),Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Malaconotidae,Laniarius (1),Length: 20 cm (2),The region of Angola inhabited by the orange-breasted bush-shrike has been subject to steady deforestation in recent decades with an increase in <strong>slash-and-burn</strong> cultivation and the removal of timber trees.  As the orange-breasted bush-shrike is known from only a small area this habitat destruction poses a great threat to the species\xe2\x80\x99 survival (2).,It is possible that the orange-breasted bush-shrike may occur within the Kisama (or Qui\xc3\xa7\xc3\xa3ma) National Park (2) although even within this supposedly protected area there are continuous problems with illegal cultivation cutting and other pressures from the human population inhabiting the park (5).  There are currently no known conservation measures in place for this Endangered species although it has been recommended that surveys to determine the distribution and population size of the orange-breasted bush-shrike along with assessments of the current extent of forest cover should be undertaken once the civil unrest in Angola subsides (2). , ,protected; ,0,1

One of the main threats to this freshwater species is a continuing decline in the quality of its habitat as a result of timber harvesting and forest management activities. Together with associated road building activities timber harvesting can affect water run-off into the streams this crayfish inhabits as well as increasing the amounts of sediment and nutrients washing into the water (1) (4) (5).,There are no specific conservation measures currently aimed at the Orbost spiny crayfish. However it is indirectly protected by fishing restrictions in Victoria which have a minimum crayfish catch size that is greater than the largest individuals of this species (1) (5). ,loss; ,protected; ,1,1

In Russia breeding sites are also at risk from spring fires which bring down tall trees suitable for nesting forcing delayed nesting and reduced reproductive success. At the wintering sites in China over-fishing has reduced the availability of prey species for the Oriental white stork. Throughout the range this stork is hunted and collected for zoos despite legal protection (3).,The Oriental white stork is legally protected in Russia Mongolia China North Korea South Korea and Japan. It also benefits from many protected areas in both Russia and China. <strong>Re-introduction</strong> programmes in South Korea and Japan should help to reduce declines but further protected areas are necessary to prevent habitat loss being the cause of this species\xe2\x80\x99 extinction. The maintenance of tall trees and the addition of artificial nest poles in potential breeding areas as well as control of human disturbance at nest sites during the breeding season should also encourage increased breeding success. Further action includes campaigns against the use of fire by farmers in the breeding grounds and against poaching (2). ,fishing; ,protected; ,1,1

Animalia,Oligosoma otagense,Otago skink (Oligosoma otagense),Animalia,Chordata,Reptilia,Squamata,Scincidae,Oligosoma (1),Length: 25 â 30 cm (2),Over the last 25 years the Otago skink has declined in both numbers and range and as these worrying declines continue (2) this <strong>endemic</strong> reptile is now considered to be Endangered (1). Although the exact causes behind these declines have not been clearly identified habitat loss and the effects of introduced species are believed to be the main factors responsible (2) (4). The conversion of tussock grassland and native scrub to agricultural land as well as grazing and burning reduce the amount of native fruits and <strong>invertebrates</strong> on which the skink feeds (4). Similarly mining quarrying forestry and invasion by weeds can reduce the amount of suitable habitat for the Otago skink (4). Mammalian predators are also a significant threat to the survival of Otago skink populations largely due to their enormous numbers; cats ferrets stoats weasels ship rats Norway rats hedgehogs and mice are all potential predators of the Otago skink (4).,Despite its worrying situation the Otago skink is thankfully the subject of a number of conservation measures. It is fully protected by law meaning that it is an offence to capture or disturb this species (2) and most of the skink populations in the eastern part of its range exist in land protected and managed by the New Zealand Department of Conservation (4). A recovery plan for this species was first published in 1995 and a second plan was published in 2006 (4). After the first one measures were implemented to control cats and ferrets in certain areas but the skink populations failed to recover. Thus a new management scheme was imposed to see if skink populations recover if all mammalian predators are eradicated or removed (4). Certain populations will be surrounded by a mammal-proof fence and all mammals eradicated within the area while other will have no fence and instead traps will be used to control predators. The effects of these treatments are not anticipated to be detected until 2009 and then depending on the outcome the most successful measure can then be implemented in other populations (4). ,loss; ,captive breeding;protected; ,1,2

By 2000 the species had undergone an estimated 80 percent population decline and is also now much reduced in range\xa0(1)\xa0(2)\xa0(4). Channel modifications including dams dredging and mining together with pollution sedimentation and water withdrawal all directly threaten the oyster mussel\xe2\x80\x99s habitat\xa0(1)\xa0(2)\xa0(3)\xa0(4) while impoundments such as dams can greatly alter factors such as water flow temperature and oxygen levels as well as presenting barriers to dispersal. Adverse effects on host fish can also indirectly impact the mussel\xe2\x80\x99s reproductive cycle. Large portions of the oyster mussel\xe2\x80\x99s historical range including the entire length of the main Tennessee and Cumberland River channels are now impounded or greatly modified leading to the extirpation of the oyster mussel from many areas\xa0(2)\xa0(3)\xa0(4). The small and fragmented populations that remain are under increased risk from isolated events such as chemical spills or from the potential negative effects of genetic isolation\xa0(4).,In 1997 the oyster mussel was listed as Endangered by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service\xa0(7) and a recovery plan was drawn up for the species\xa0(4). The conservation measures recommended by this plan include the protection of remaining mussel populations and habitat identifying or re-establishing additional populations undertaking further research into the species\xe2\x80\x99 ecology life history and genetic diversity the implementation of a monitoring programme and working to improve habitat quality\xa0(3)\xa0(4). Techniques for the artificial propagation of laboratory- or hatchery-reared mussels are also being developed with the ultimate aim of reintroducing the oyster mussel into parts of its historical range\xa0(3)\xa0(4)\xa0(8). ,pollution; , ,1,0

It is locally abundant and has a high reproductive rate most likely allowing fast recovery from minor reductions in population numbers. Sapphire mining operations near to the habitat of the painted burrowing frog are considered to be a threat to populations and further potential threats include increasing tourist activity and habitat loss from fire wood extraction and over-grazing by livestock (1).,Several populations of the painted burrowing frog occur in the Isalo National Park where the habitat is protected but habitat loss elsewhere is likely and potentially dangerous to the remaining unprotected populations (1).

The area occupied by the Palawan horned frog is now small and severely fragmented which together with the continued decline in the extent and quality of its habitat puts it at particular risk of extinction\xa0(1). Many amphibian species are coming under increasing pressure from factors including climate change and disease (5) but it is not known to what extent these are currently affecting the Palawan horned frog.,The Palawan horned frog is found in several protected areas although water pollution may still impact the species within these. Specific conservation measures recommended for this <strong>endemic</strong> amphibian include the regulation and proper disposal of agricultural chemicals and the effective protection of the remaining rainforest particularly that occurring along streams and rivers\xa0(1)\xa0(2). General conservation actions suggested for other amphibians such as captive breeding disease research and increasing public awareness\xa0(5) may also potentially benefit the Palawan horned frog as may further research surveys and population monitoring\xa0(2). ,loss;disease;pollution; ,captive breeding;protected; ,3,2
Animalia,Atlapetes pallidiceps,Pale-headed brush-finch (Atlapetes pallidiceps),Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Emberizidae,Atlapetes (1),Length: 16 cm (2),Habitat loss from human landscape modification seems to be the primary reason for the bird\xe2\x80\x99s limited distribution and remains a major concern for the species\xe2\x80\x99 long term survival (4) (5). In the arid valleys of the R\xc3\xado Jubones drainage areas where water is available have been widely cultivated and large numbers of cattle and goats have stripped the area of vegetation (2) (3). Local use of fires to clear vegetation also potentially threatens suitable habitat particularly if these fires get out of control (2). Another major threat is brood parasitism from the shiny cowbird which has expanded its range considerably in recent decades and is now the most widespread brood parasite of South America and abundant in the R\xc3\xado Jubones drainage (4). Brood parasitism has significantly impacted the breeding success of the pale-headed brush-finch with a shocking 61 percent\xa0of pairs breeding in Yunguilla Reserve parasitized in 2002 (5).,After the rediscovery of this rare bird in 1998 the small 27 hectares patch of suitable habitat in which it was found was purchased by Fundacion Jocotoco to form the Yunguilla Reserve which has since been progressively expanded to cover most of the known population (3). This Reserve has been securely fenced off to prevent grazing pressure with a local landowner hired as a part time guardian. In 2002 a habitat management scheme was implemented to halt vegetation growth and convert unsuitable to suitable habitat by selectively thinning dense thickets (2). In order to assess the success of the habitat management scheme implemented in 2002 a habitat occupancy monitoring scheme was set up with Fundacion Jocotoco in 2004 (2) (5). In 2003 a hunter was employed to remove shiny cowbirds from the reserve during the pale-headed brush-finch\xe2\x80\x99s breeding season with a resultant 69 cowbirds shot (5). Cowbird removal strongly increased reproductive success that year with 16 chicks fledging in Yunguilla Reserve compared to just five the previous year (2). Further cowbird removal has been conducted and in 2005 the parasitism rate was down to two percent (3). Fundacion Jocotoco has also made repeated visits to local agencies land owners and schools in order to raise local awareness of the plight of this species (5). These intensive conservation measures have helped save the species from immediate extinction having significantly increased the population from just 10 to 12 pairs in 1999 to over\xa050 pairs in 2006 and approximate 230 mature individuals in 2011\xa0(2) (3) (5). However further population growth is thought to be strongly constrained by a lack of suitable habitat to accommodate it (2) (5). Thus although great progress has been made since the pale-headed brush-finch\xe2\x80\x99s rediscovery much remains to be done to overcome the immediate threats to its long-term survival (5). ,loss; , ,1,0

The Panay bushy-tailed cloud rat has been bred in captivity including the UK\xe2\x80\x99s London Zoo the first institution outside of the Philippines to successfully breed the rat. The aim is to establish a viable captive population outside of the Philippines as an \xe2\x80\x98insurance population\xe2\x80\x99 (4).

Plantae,Caesalpinia echinata,Pau brasil (Caesalpinia echinata),Plantae,Tracheophyta,Magnoliopsida,Fabales,Leguminosae,Caesalpinia (1),Height: 5 - 15 m (2),In the past the pau brasil was an extremely important source of red dye a trade that began in the 1500s (1). The use of synthetic dyes only became widespread in the late 19th Century by which time the natural stands of Brazil's national tree had been all but destroyed (1). The wood is a hard and durable timber and has been in demand for construction over the centuries (3). Today the main threat facing this species is its exportation for the manufacture of high-quality violin bows (2). This tree is the main source of professional bows worldwide and it is estimated that a single violin bow which may cost up to $ 5000 requires 1 kg of wood (5). Brazil's Atlantic forest is an extremely threatened habitat and has now been reduced to less than 5% of its original cover (4).,The country of Brazil was named after the 'brasileiros' who originally collected the dyewood of this tree and the pau brasil has an important place in the history and culture of the country. This species is included in the official list of threatened Brazilian plants by the Brazilian Institute of Natural Resources (IBAMA) (1) (6) and there are various laws restricting the export and cutting of the pau brasil although these are often poorly enforced (5). Two protected areas were set up in Bahia and Pernambuco in order to preserve populations of pau brasil in these regions (5). Fauna and Flora International (FFI) have launched a SoundWood programme as part of their Global Trees Campaign in order to raise awareness of the issues surrounding the demand for hardwoods for musical instruments (4). They are working closely with a local Brazilian NGO known as Amainan Brasil (7) which is running environmental education programmes in schools in the Atlantic Forest region and is investigating the distribution of this tree in Rio State (4). Such a historic tree may act as an important 'flagship' species for the protection of Brazil's precious Atlantic Forest. , ,protected; ,0,1

It was extirpated from the Middle East in the 19<sup>th</sup> century and by 1940 the species was believed to be extinct (7) but thankfully in 1956 two tiny wild populations were discovered in the Kuzistan province of Iran (4) (7).,The Persian fallow deer has been rescued from the brink of extinction by substantial conservation efforts. The tiny native populations of Iran have provided the base for all captive populations and for the <strong>reintroduced</strong> populations in Israel and elsewhere in Iran (1) (4) (7). ,loss;hunting;pet; ,protected; ,3,1
Pelecanoides garnoti,Pelecanoides garnotii,Peruvian diving-petrel (Pelecanoides garnotii),Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Procellariiformes,Pelecanoididae,Pelecanoides (1),Length: 22 cm (2),<strong>Guano</strong> used by man as fertiliser due to its high nutrient content has been historically extracted from the island homes of the Peruvian diving-petrel. This large-scale extraction is thought to be the cause of the large declines suffered by this bird but guano harvests continue every five to seven years regardless. Hunting also continues and many birds are killed by the fishing industry as <strong>by-catch</strong>. Introduced rats cats and foxes have exterminated the Peruvian diving-petrel on many islands and continue to pose a threat to the remaining populations (2).,All breeding colonies of the Peruvian diving-petrel are found in reserves but only one of these benefits from trained guards. Searches have taken place to find further colonies in Chile but to no avail. As the threats to this species continue with no sign of abatement it is crucial to address them. Predator control and halting <strong>guano</strong> extraction are particularly important if this species is to survive (2). ,hunting;fishing;pet; , ,3,0

Black spider monkey; black-faced spider monkey; Chamek spider monkey; Peruvian black spider monkey,Ateles chamek,Peruvian spider monkey (Ateles chamek),Animalia,Chordata,Mammalia,Primates,Atelidae,Ateles (1),ca. 7 kg (2),The Peruvian spider monkey is under serious threat from hunting for food as well as from habitat loss as forests are cleared for agriculture cattle ranching and mining (1). Selective logging may also remove key fruiting trees such as figs and open up the forest to further hunting (1) (14) while the building of the Transoceanic highway between Brazil and Peru brings the threat of increased hunting and deforestation throughout the southern part of the species\xe2\x80\x99 range (1). Its dependence on mature undisturbed forest makes the Peruvian spider monkey particularly vulnerable to habitat loss and degradation while its slow reproductive rate means that populations take a long time to recover from any losses (1) (2) (5) (8) (15).,The Peruvian spider monkey occurs in many protected areas throughout its range (1) and international trade in the species should be regulated under its listing on Appendix II of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) (3). However tighter controls on hunting together with stronger measures to preserve its habitat are likely to be needed if this charismatic primate is to be properly protected. ,loss;hunting; ,cites;protected; ,2,2
Charrancito Peruano,Sterna lorata,Peruvian tern (Sterna lorata),Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Charadriiformes,Laridae,Sterna (1),Size: 22 â 24 cm (2),The Peruvian tern\xe2\x80\x99s small population is largely threatened by disturbance and loss of its breeding grounds due to human development frequently the building of shanty towns and summer homes and as the result of human activities such as 4x4 vehicle driving on the beaches. Off-road vehicles have also led to increased access and therefore disturbance to previously inaccessible breeding areas. In Chile current concerns include the building of port facilities at Mejillones off-road driving at Rio Loa and the construction of coastal highways throughout the north. In Paracas Bay Peru increased pollution may also pose a risk to the birds (5). Furthermore with greater development and human encroachment on the Peruvian tern\xe2\x80\x99s breeding habitat comes a greater threat from domestic animals such as dogs and cats which may disturb prey or trample upon eggs and young chicks (3). This already rare bird has also undoubtedly suffered from the 1972 collapse of anchovetta stocks an important food source which have not subsequently recovered (5).,There are currently no known conservation measures underway to protect the Peruvian tern (5). Suggested measures include searching for colonies in previously unsurveyed areas and protecting known colonies from habitat disturbance and destruction such as by building fences around breeding sites to prevent vehicle access (3). ,loss;pollution; , ,2,0

Habitat has been destroyed by clearing and illegal logging leaving less than just 1 % of original old-growth lowland forest remaining on Negros Island where the largest population of this species is found (3). Lowland rainforest on Cebu Island is virtually gone altogether and it is not known if this species still survives there as it has not been seen for over 10 years. Thus the Philippine tube-nosed bat now clings to a precarious existence edging slowly closer to extinction as illegal logging and clearing continue to reduce vital habitat ever further (4).,Both Mount Canlaon and a part of the mountainous southern fragment where this bat is thought to occur on Negros Island are designated by the national government as protected areas. Nevertheless deforestation continues to pose a serious threat including in the beautiful Twin Lakes Region that falls within the southern \xe2\x80\x98protected area\xe2\x80\x99 (6). If the remaining forest fragments were adequately protected this rare and intriguing species may have a chance of survival (2) but if current rates of habitat loss continue the future for this bat looks pretty bleak. , ,protected; ,0,1

The additional pressure of hunting for both food and for the pet trade is adding to the problem (8). It is thought that up to ten animals will have died during capture or transit for every baby gibbon sold as a pet (8).,The pileated gibbon is protected from international trade by its listing on Appendix I of the Convention on International trade in endangered Species (CITES) (2). The World Association of Zoos and Aquariums (WAZA) established an International Studbook in 1990 for the pileated gibbon and conservation breeding programmes were set up to ensure there is a viable reserve population (9). The Cardomom Project was set up with Fauna &amp; Flora International (FFI) to preserve the Cardomom Mountains region in south west Cambodia to protect both the habitat from destruction and the wildlife from hunters. It is hoped that species such as the pileated gibbon will benefit from the work carried out by this project (7). ,hunting;pet; ,cites;protected; ,2,2

Columba mayeri,Nesoenas mayeri,Pink pigeon (Nesoenas mayeri),Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Columbiformes,Columbidae,Columba (1),0.35 kg (3),Severe deforestation on the island of Mauritius has caused catastrophic declines in a number of species the pink pigeon included (2). Predation by introduced species such as the macaque (<i>Macaca fasicularis</i>) mongoose (<i>Herpestes auropunctatus</i>) rats and feral cats have further decimated the population (6). Cyclones also batter the island destroying nest sites (2).,The pink pigeon has been rescued from the very brink of extinction by an intensive management programme in partnership between the Durrell Wildlife Conservation Trust (8) Mauritian Wildlife Foundation and the Wildlife Preservation Trust Canada (7). A captive breeding programme began in the early 1980s (6) and Gerald Durrell released the first individuals into the wild in 1984 (9). As of 2002 there are around 350 birds in the wild (9) and the project is fast approaching its target of 500 individuals (6). To supplement the captive breeding and release programme conservation efforts such as the establishment of Conservation Management Areas habitat restoration control of predators and supplementary feeding has enabled this species to increase in abundance (2). Although intensive management of the species is still required the rescue of the pink pigeon is a fantastic success story and a great example of what concerted conservation efforts can achieve. , ,captive breeding; ,0,1

As a result an area covering just half a hectare harbours the remaining <i>Pisonia sechellarum</i> (1) a population which was estimated to contain just 190 trees in 1990 (2).  This small population suffers from suspected low <strong>genetic diversity</strong> and a poor rate of seed <strong>germination</strong> (1) factors which my hinder the population\xe2\x80\x99s recovery and threaten its survival.,The small area in which <i>Pisonia sechellarum</i> occurs lies within forest protected by the Nature Protection Trust of Seychelles (NPTS) (1).  The NPTS established the Silhouette Conservation Project in 1997 and has since been protecting the island\xe2\x80\x99s environments and endeavouring to restore them to a near-natural state (4).   Through the valuable work of the NPTS which includes conducting research into the animals and plants of the island and efforts to control invasive species (4) hopefully the exceptional biodiversity of this island including <i>Pisonia sechellarum</i> will be preserved. , ,protected; ,0,1

However by 2005 the numbers of cats and rats had recovered and after two unsuccessful eradication attempts there may be little support for a third (3). Habitat degradation is also a threat due to clearance for crops and gardening browsing by goats overexploitation for wood and the spread of introduced plants such as the rose apple. Today only remnants of the original vegetation remain (3) (4). The highly restricted range of the Pitcairn reed-warbler covering just the five square kilometres of Pitcairn puts it at particular risk as does its small population which is continuing to decline due to ongoing predation and habitat loss (2) (3).,Although eradication programmes for cats and rats have previously been undertaken on Pitcairn rat eradication was unsuccessful leading the island residents to reintroduce cats in an effort to control rat numbers. However further attempts to control or eradicate these predators have been recommended (3). The Pitcairn reed-warbler is protected from killing or egg-collection under Local Government Regulations 1971 (4) and it has been suggested that the islanders be involved in monitoring its population. Protection of the remaining forest habitat as well as preventing the introduction of further alien species will also be important for the reed-warbler\xe2\x80\x99s survival (3). Organisations such as the RSPB are undertaking a variety of conservation work in the Pitcairn Islands and other UK Overseas Territories helping in the efforts to protect the Pitcairn reed-warbler and other threatened island species (6). ,loss; ,protected; ,1,1

In Indonesia habitat destruction is a major problem as a result of illegal and commercial logging and large agricultural projects such as rubber and oil palm plantations (7).  <i>Nepenthes boschiana</i> is not found in any national park or protected area (8) and has a highly localised distribution making this species particularly susceptible to extinction through habitat destruction or catastrophic environmental events such as drought or fire. In addition montane species such as <i>Nepenthes boschiana</i> take longer to recover than lowland plants after such events as growth is slower (2).,Although listed under Appendix II of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) which limits the international export of this species (3) trade is very difficult to regulate.  There is no requirement for internationally traded <i>Nepenthes</i> to be identified down to species level and plants simply labelled as <i>Nepenthes </i>accounted for 94 percent of all exported <i>Nepenthes </i>plants between 1988 and 1993.  This needs to be remedied and urgent attention is required to close other trade loopholes (2).  <i>Nepenthes</i> species including <i>Nepenthes boschiana</i> are being increasingly cultivated helping to reduce the impact on wild populations.

Habitat loss is probably the biggest threat to their survival however as vast areas of South East Asia are developed in order to support the growing population (2).,<i>Nepenthes rajah</i> is listed on Appendix I of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) which bans all trade in wild plants of this species (3). It is unlikely that illegal collection poses much of a risk to the species due to the inaccessibility of its mountain habitat (2). In addition recent micropropagation techniques have proved successful allowing these pitcher plants to be produced artificially thus reducing the need for wild-collected plants to meet the demand (2). This species of pitcher plant is found almost entirely within the conservation area of Kinabalu Park in Sabah where this giant of the plant world attracts valuable tourist revenue and this alone may well be enough to secure its future. ,loss; ,cites; ,1,1

It is thought that breeding success is affected by the presence of several introduced species on the islands including cattle sheep pigs cats dogs rats and the weka bird (<i>Gallirallus australis</i>). Birds are sometimes illegally shot by fisherman for stealing their catch and they are also caught in very large numbers in crayfish pots. Changes in the marine environment associated with climate change may be affecting the prey species of the Pitt Island shag (2).,The sheep and cattle of Rangatira were removed in 1961 as were the sheep of Mangere Island in 1968. This was judged to have had a beneficial effect and authorities are now working to remove feral cats and weka from Pitt Island and sheep cattle and pigs from parts of Pitt and Chatham Island that are deemed to be suitable for nesting <strong>colonies</strong>. <strong>Colonies</strong> that appear to be suffering as a result of stock may be fenced off in the future depending on agreements with local people and landowners (2). ,environment; , ,1,0

All nesting sites on Niuafo'ou are harvested by the local human population with at least 50 % of all eggs being collected or destroyed. Adults are also hunted on a smaller scale and both adults and chicks suffer from predation by feral cats and dogs. Pigs may pose an additional threat by competing for food. Fortunately Fonualei is uninhabited and little-visited so the population there is relatively safe from the threats of hunting and human disturbance (5). In 2003 an incredible 300 to 500 birds were estimated to exist on the island a significant increase from the 35 eggs and chicks that were introduced in 1993. Following this remarkable discovery which effectively doubled the total known population of Polynesian megapode the species was downlisted from Critically Endangered to Endangered on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species (5) (3).,The Polynesian megapode is legally protected although in practice there is no real enforcement and egg-collecting urgently needs to be brought under control. From 1991 to 1993 60 eggs were introduced on Late Island buried at volcanically heated sites and 35 eggs and chicks were transferred to Fonualei both islands being uninhabited rarely visited and with appropriate egg-laying conditions. While surveys suggest the reintroduction on Late failed the now established population on Fonualei is a fantastic conservation success story and provides new hope for the future of this rare bird. It has been advocated that Fonualei should be given Reserve status and if achieved this volcanic island may prove to be the safe refuge that ensures the Polynesian megapodes long-term survival (5). However there is always the threat of eruption which could potentially destroy the Fonualei population completely and thus this species\xe2\x80\x99 restricted range leaves it in an extremely vulnerable position. ,hunting;pet; ,protected; ,2,1

Preussâs monkey,Cercopithecus preussi,Preussâs guenon (Cercopithecus preussi),Animalia,Chordata,Mammalia,Primates,Cercopithecidae,Cercopithecus (1),Average body length: 47.7 cm (2),Over the past 27 years populations of Preuss\xe2\x80\x99s guenon have decreased by an incredible 50 percent (1) due to a combination of habitat loss and hunting. As a result of farming fire and the collection of wood for fuel little of Cameroon\xe2\x80\x99s <strong>montane forest</strong> remains. Preuss\xe2\x80\x99s guenon is particularly vulnerable to hunting due to its fairly large size and its semi-terrestrial habits; spending time on land increases its risk of being killed. Hunting of this species is a particular problem on the island of Bioko (1).,A significant hindrance to the conservation of this species is that no <strong>montane forest</strong> in the Cameroon highlands is currently protected; this situation needs to urgently change as it is the most critical remaining habitat for Preuss\xe2\x80\x99s guenon. However there are several national parks elsewhere in this monkeys\xe2\x80\x99 range including Banyang Hbo Forest in Cameroon Cross River National Park in Nigeria and Pico Basil National Park on Bioko Island (1). This species is also listed in the African Convention as Class B which means it is protected but may be hunted captured collected or killed if special authorisation is given (9). ,loss;hunting; ,protected; ,2,1

Vast areas of the native rainforest have been cleared for timber and for the construction of oil-palm plantations which now constitute one of Malaysia's top exports (4). Proboscis monkeys do not adapt to degraded habitat and recent technical advances have meant that even mangrove swamps may now be logged (4). Hunting is also a threat to the survival of this species; their propensity to gather in large groups on the river's edge makes these monkeys easy targets (4).,The proboscis monkey is protected by law (4) and is listed on Appendix I of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) banning international trade (3). This species is found in at least a dozen protected areas (2). Recently a vital area of wetland in Sabah has been designated as a sanctuary for a wide range of endangered species such as Asian elephants (<i>Elephas maximus</i>) and orang-utans (<i>Pongo pygmaeus</i>) as well as proboscis monkeys; this area is the Kinabatangan Wildlife Sanctuary (4). However even this corridor is currently fragmented by plantations which proboscis monkeys cannot cross (4). The protection of remaining tracts of contiguous habitat is therefore vital for the survival of this unusual looking monkey. ,loss;hunting; ,cites;protected; ,2,2

Takh; Takhi,Equus ferus przewalskii,Przewalski's horse (Equus ferus przewalskii),Animalia,Chordata,Mammalia,Perissodactyla,Equidae,Equus (1),350 kg (2),Habitat degradation human activities including hunting and conflict along with competition with domestic livestock for water and forage were all thought to be responsible for driving the extinction of Przewalski's horse in the wild in the 1960s (4). Thankfully it has been possible to reintroduce this unique survivor into the wild. However those reintroduced populations still face threats; primarily that of <strong>hybridisation</strong> with domestic horses along with competition with domestic horses for resources (1).,After the <strong>subspecies</strong> became Extinct in the Wild it clung on in a number of small populations in various zoos around the world. In 1977 the Foundation for the Preservation and Protection of the Przewalski's horse (FPPPH) was established in the Netherlands with the long-term aim of returning this ancient horse to the wild (6). At that time there were around 300 horses in zoos and parks and their breeding was managed in order to prevent <strong>inbreeding</strong> (6). In the 1990s The Mongolian Association for Conservation of Nature and the Environment (MACNE) and the FPPPH collaborated to reintroduce a number of individuals in small herds into the Hustai National Park in central Mongolia (7). The national symbol was a welcome return to the area and part of an important drive to save the steppe biotope (6). Today more than 120 Przewalski's horses live in Hustai and a further conservation programme run by the International Takhi Group (a consortium of European takhi breeding institutions) together with the Mongolian Commission for Endangered Species has introduced a further 50 horses to an area in the Dzungarian Gobi in Southwest Mongolia (5). The return of the Przewalski's horse to its natural environment is a success story for conservation and despite ongoing problems it is hoped that at least two large self-sustained populations will soon be a reality (7). ,hunting;pet; , ,2,0

The main threat to this elusive frog is the loss of its forest habitat to encroaching agriculture (1). Within the Western Ghats over 90 percent of the forest has been lost with conversion to coffee cardamom ginger and other crop plantations the most significant agents (1) (2). The potential for dam developments to inundate vast areas of its habitat also mean that the status of the purple frog is extremely precarious (7).,Due to its threatened status and evolutionary distinctiveness the purple frog is categorised as a focal species on the Zoological Society of London\xe2\x80\x99s EDGE of Existence programme. This project aims to highlight the need for the conservation of this unique species while establishing a set of conservation priorities and as a result studies are currently being undertaken to investigate the purple frog\xe2\x80\x99s ecology and threats (5).\xa0 ,loss; ,protected; ,1,1

Historically the Maranon River landscape has undergone high levels of habitat conversion for cultivation and much of the original natural habitat has been lost or continues to be degraded.\xa0Cattle ranching logging and firewood collecting has removed much of the forest habitat while oil extraction is a potential future problem (4) (7).,The Maranon valley home to the purple-backed sunbeam is an area of high conservation importance as its isolation and unique habitats has resulted in a large degree of <strong>endemism</strong>.\xa0A total of twenty two bird species are <strong>endemic</strong> to the valley and as a result it has been designated as a Birdlife International Endemic Bird Area (EBA) (7).\xa0The Maranon valley has also been designated as part of the Maranon-Alto Mayo Conservation corridor as it supports a high number of conservation priority areas. \xa0The American Bird Conservancy has been working to analyse the distribution of rare bird species within the Maranon valley and identify the areas and habitats that require protection.\xa0A wide array of conservation strategies have been proposed including strict protected area status sustainable conservation and community owned nature reserves. However at present only 0.1 percent of the Maranon valley has any legal protection and these measures need to be applied urgently (8).\xa0 ,disease; ,protected; ,1,1
purple-faced leaf monkey,Trachypithecus vetulus,Purple-faced langur (Trachypithecus vetulus),Animalia,Chordata,Mammalia,Primates,Cercopithecidae,Trachypithecus (1),Male head-body length: 50 â 65 cm (2)Female head-body length: 45 â 60 cm (2)Male tail length: 67 â 85 cm(2)Female tail length: 62 â 82 cm (2)Male weight: 3.4 â 9.4 kg (2)Female weight: 3.1 â 9 kg (2),The purple-faced langur\xe2\x80\x99s range has contracted greatly in the face of human encroachment. Deforestation as a result of agricultural industrial and residential development has led to habitat loss and fragmentation and the consequent isolation of subpopulations which impedes out-breeding and genetic diversity. From 1956 to 1993 Sri Lanka lost more than 50 percent of its forests to human activities followed by a similar rate of decline between 1994 and 2003. This species has also suffered from hunting and illegal trade of its meat and skin with the skin used to make drums in some areas. The purple-faced langur is hunted mainly for subsistence living and trade at local village level. According to continuing trends populations of this species are predicted to decline by more than 50 percent within the next 11 to 22 years (1).,The commercial exploitation of purple-faced langurs is regulated by their listing on Appendix II of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) (3). All four <strong>subspecies</strong> are also protected under the Flora and Fauna Protection Ordinance 1993 and exist in a number of protected areas (1). However the issue of habitat loss still places these <strong>subspecies</strong> classified as Endangered and Critically Endangered at serious risk of extinction (1). Indeed the Critically Endangered western purple-faced langur (<i>T. v. nestor</i>) was officially recognised in 2004 as one of the world\xe2\x80\x99s 25 most endangered primates. This <strong>subspecies</strong> requires good canopy cover but possibly fewer than three forests currently exist within Sri Lanka that can support viable populations and none of these are within protected areas. Furthermore the human-modified areas that support much of the langur population such as gardens and rubber plantations are under private ownership and therefore unstable changing rapidly due to human population expansion and development. Censuses are therefore urgently needed to identify forest areas suitable for conservation. Further studies are also essential to better understand the decline of sub-populations in both space and time in the extremely disturbed habitats where these langurs survive today (6). ,loss;fragmentation;hunting; ,cites;protected; ,3,2

OrnithoptÃ¨re De La Reine Alexandra,Ornithoptera alexandrae,Queen Alexandraâs birdwing (Ornithoptera alexandrae),Animalia,Arthropoda,Insecta,Lepidoptera,Papilionidae,Ornithoptera (1),Wingspan: 19 â 28 cm (2),As one of the world\xe2\x80\x99s most beautiful butterflies Queen Alexandra\xe2\x80\x99s birdwing is extremely attractive to collectors. Fetching thousands of dollars per butterfly this rare species has suffered severely from over harvesting (4). Recognising a dramatic decline in 1966 the Papua New Guinea government gave Queen Alexandra\xe2\x80\x99s birdwing legal protection from collectors. Consequently trade in this butterfly has been somewhat reduced but illegal collection continues to threaten this species. Today however the greatest threat to Queen Alexandra\xe2\x80\x99s birdwing is the loss of its lowland rainforest habitat. Historically forests were cleared for subsistence farming and logging and large tracts of forest were destroyed by the volcanic eruption of Mount Lamington in 1951. Presently the main cause behind forest loss is the expansion of the palm oil industry compounded by the development of rubber and cocoa plantations (7).\xa0\xa0,Threatened by illegal trade and habitat loss the survival of Queen Alexandra\xe2\x80\x99s birdwing is dependant upon the successful implementation of conservation measures. To abate trade pressure Queen Alexandra\xe2\x80\x99s birdwing is listed on Appendix I of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) and as an Annex A species in the EU Council Regulation on trade of wild species both of which prohibit international trade (2) (3). Furthermore the Papua New Guinea government has provided financial aid to local communities to develop butterfly nurseries.\xa0 These licensed farms aim to sustainably trade wild butterflies whilst providing local communities with an additional income and improving the long-term survival prospects of many rare butterfly species (8). In addition a large wildlife management area has been created protecting much Queen Alexandra\xe2\x80\x99s birdwing habitat. Assuming these measures continue successfully there is significant hope that the beautiful Queen Alexandra\xe2\x80\x99s birdwing will continue to grace the forests of Papua New Guinea (7).\xa0 ,loss; ,cites; ,1,1
Queen of the Puna,Puya raimondii,Queen of the Andes (Puya raimondii),Plantae,Tracheophyta,Liliopsida,Poales,Bromeliaceae,Puya (1),Puya (1),The high Peruvian Andes have suffered thousands of years of heavy human impact through vegetation destruction grazing by livestock fires and the introduction of exotic species (5). Today the Queen of the Andes has an extremely fragmented distribution with many populations comprising just a few hundred individuals or even less. Cattle are often allowed to roam freely in this species\xe2\x80\x99 habitat which results in the trampling or consumption of young plants hindering reproduction. Fires are often used to create farmland as well as to gain access to the starch in this plant\xe2\x80\x99s trunk to feed cattle indiscriminately destroying all vegetation in the area (1) (4).\xa0,Due to its high proportion or rare and <strong>endemic</strong> plant species the Andean region is regarded as being a \xe2\x80\x9chyperhot\xe2\x80\x9d priority for plant conservation meaning action is urgently required to preserve this unique ecosystem and its important vegetation. Any conservation action in the Andes cannot fail to consider the need to conserve the Queen of the Andes perhaps the most conspicuous and charismatic member of the Andean floral community (5).\xa0 , , ,0,0

For example it is one of the most important fishes taken by the Moroccan fishing fleet (4) and the second most important species for coastal bottom fisheries in the Azores (5).  There is some evidence that this exploitation is having a negative effect on red porgy populations; for example in southern Brazil trawl fishing during the 1970s left red porgy stocks over-exploited (10).,In some areas of its range fishery regulations exist for the red porgy.  For instance off the southern coast of the United States there is a size limit in place a ban on the sale or purchase of red porgy between January and April (an important spawning period) and limits to how many can be caught during a fishing trip (11). ,fishing; , ,1,0

The attractive plumage of the red-and-blue lory has made it a popular cage bird for over a century and consequently wild birds have been intensively trapped to fulfil the demand for international trade. Trapping began as early as the 19<sup>th</sup>century with most birds being traded within Indonesia and the Philippines. Trapping intensified in the 1990s with an estimated 1000 to 2000 birds leaving Karakelang each year (6). Around 3500 birds were traded between 1992 and 1993 which attracted more trappers and resulted in the development of modern more efficient trapping methods. In 1995 the red-and-blue lory was at last listed under Appendix I of CITES which prohibited international trade excluding exceptional circumstances such as scientific research (3). However trapping continued in the latter 1990s with an estimated 80 percent of the illegal trade going to the Philippines (7).\xa0\xa0,Karakelang is believed to contain the only remaining viable population of the red-and-blue lory and consequently efforts are underway to reduce trade on the island (7) (10). The Action Sampiri project is working to improve awareness amongst local communities about the global importance of the island to the species and to improve future land use. Investigations by the wildlife trade monitoring network TRAFFIC and the inclusion of the species on the Indonesian list of protected species also highlights the species\xe2\x80\x99 plight and the urgent need for the application of conservation measures (7). A substantial part of the red-and-blue lory\xe2\x80\x99s range is within the Karakelang Wildlife Sanctuary although there is believed to be no management plan for this protected area and the level of law enforcement varies. The red-and-blue lory will also benefit from numerous proposed conservation measures including the monitoring of population trends and trapping levels the strict enforcement of trade legislation provision of training and resources to park management staff and the continuation of community awareness programmes (6). ,loss;disease;pet; ,protected; ,3,1

The two islands where the racer persists are mongoose-free but additional threats include other introduced animals such as cats dogs and rats (9) as well as negative local attitudes towards the snake (4).,Fortunately there are some systems in place to conserve the red-bellied racer. For example on St Eustatius the Quill-Boven National Park is a protected area which provides suitable habitat for red-bellied racers with plenty of rocky terrain (4) (11). , ,protected; ,0,1
Blumenbachâs curassow; mutum,Crax blumenbachii,Red-billed curassow (Crax blumenbachii),Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Galliformes,Cracidae,Crax (1),c. 3.5 kg (2),The red-billed curassow has suffered from habitat loss and hunting and is now thought to be on the brink of extinction with fewer than 250 individuals estimated to remain in small fragmented subpopulations. Virtually all lowland forest north of Rio de Janeiro has disappeared outside of reserves having been converted to plantations and pastureland. Even in Monte Pascoal National Park habitat loss continues as a result of conflicts over the land rights of local people. Hunting and capture for the bird trade persist in some reserves and are likely to have a severe impact on such small fragmented populations (4).,This rare bird is protected under Brazilian law and listed on Appendix I of CITES making international trade in the species illegal. Of the few reserves where this species can still be found Sooretama and Linhares are the most effectively protected and contain strongholds of over 60 and 100 individuals respectively (4). A captive-breeding and reintroduction programme in a number of protected sites in 1990 and 1991 has been highly successful helping to boost numbers in the wild but the total population nevertheless remains extremely small (2) (4). If this large and distinctive forest bird is to survive it is imperative that all reserves with known populations are vigilantly patrolled and protected to prevent the hunting and trapping that continue to threaten its existence (4). ,loss;hunting; ,cites;protected; ,2,2
Barnacla Cuellirroja,Branta ruficollis,Red-breasted goose (Branta ruficollis),Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Anseriformes,Anatidae,Branta (1),Length: 53 â 56 cm (2),Hunting in Bulgaria as well as in Romania and Ukraine is a threat for the red-breasted goose. Tourist trips for hunting are becoming more common in Ukraine and birds are often shot at the breeding grounds in Russia. Additionally climate change is expected to alter tundra habitats and thereby reduce breeding success. The use of rodenticides in the wintering grounds has also had a deleterious impact upon populations of the red-breasted goose (2) (8).,The red-breasted goose is legally protected in many key states and parts of the breeding and wintering ranges are protected but hunting continues regardless. Wintering sites in Bulgaria Romania and Ukraine are on a monitoring programme through the Red-breasted Goose Monitoring and Research Programme. The goal is to provide up-to-date information regarding the status of the species its habitat movements ecology and conservation needs (10). In Bulgaria a management plan is being implemented for roosting lakes (2). In Romania a management plan was drafted for Lake Techirghiol in 2008 along with the Romanian National Action Plan (10). An International Action Plan was published in 1996 which proposed a number of conservation measures for the red-breasted goose. These included the expansion of monitoring and research programmes protection of key sites control of illegal hunting promotion of beneficial agricultural policies and the continuation of public awareness initiatives (8). ,hunting; ,protected; ,1,1

Habitat destruction has been rife and is primarily the result of conversion to plantations and pastureland and logging operations (2) (5). Surviving populations are small and fragmented and now suffer from reduced foraging sites increased competition for nesting areas and the effects of genetic isolation (2). Yet deforestation continues compounded by the ever-present threat of capture for the domestic pet trade driving this rare parrot into a steep decline (2) (6). Sadly the species is not even safe in reserves with most of the 174 nestlings poached for the national and international cage-bird trade in the 1998 to 1999 breeding season reportedly coming from \xe2\x80\x98protected areas\xe2\x80\x99. Souvenirs containing feathers have also been seen for sale outside Monte Pascoal National Park (5).,The red-browed Amazon is protected under Brazilian law and occurs in 14 reserves though most of these provide very little habitat protection on the ground and none are effective against poaching (5). Captive breeding though difficult has been successful in America and Europe and a global management plan for captive red-browed Amazons is now underway (2) (6). Reintroductions into the wild from captive stock may become an important conservation strategy in the future but it is unlikely to successfully bolster numbers until sufficient habitat is secured that can sustain expanded wild flocks (2). Thus law enforcement and <i>in situ</i> conservation to protect the diminishing Atlantic forests of Brazil must remain priorities in the protection of this and other <strong>endemic</strong> species if they are going to have any kind of future in the wild. ,pet; ,captive breeding;protected; ,1,2
red-cheeked macaw,Ara rubrogenys,Red-fronted macaw (Ara rubrogenys),Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Psittaciformes,Psittacidae,Ara (1),Length: 55 - 60 cm (2),The reasons for the drastic decline of this species include widespread habitat loss and degradation largely as a result of conversion to agriculture but also caused by logging and collection of firewood. This species is illegally trapped for the pet trade but the scale of this problem is unclear. Furthermore as the natural food sources of this bird are lost it has to rely more on crops and it becomes increasingly exposed to persecution as a result (2).,The red-fronted macaw is listed under Appendix I and II of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) and so international trade in this species is tightly controlled (3). Within Bolivia the capture transport and export of this species are illegal. This macaw occurs in just one protected area but just eight birds are known to breed within this park. Birdlife Bolivia initiated a conservation programme for this species in 2002 which incorporates surveying and monitoring of the species identifying priority areas of habitat for the species and establishing a community awareness programme in the area. Other proposed measures include the complete elimination of trade in this bird and fencing-off areas of suitable habitat to reduce grazing by livestock allowing the natural vegetation to make a come-back (2). ,loss;pet; ,cites;protected; ,2,2

Although laws exist to protect this species from hunting throughout its range such protective legislation is rarely enforced (1). This rare primate is particularly vulnerable to this exploitation as when disturbed it remains motionless in the canopy instead of fleeing making it an easy hunting target (1) (5). It has also suffered from extensive habitat loss particularly in the Central Highlands of Vietnam where large tracts of forest were damaged during wartimes (1) (8). More recently a rapidly expanding human population in this region has resulted in agricultural expansion with forest areas converted to farmlands and increased logging for coffee rubber and cashew plantations (1) (5).,The red-shanked douc is afforded the highest level of protection in Vietnam under the Wildlife Protection Law and should be protected from international trade by its listing on Appendix I of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) (3) (8). It also receives a degree of protection in a number of national parks and reserves including several in the Nam Theum basin in Lao PDR which is thought to support the largest remaining population of the species although hunting is still prevalent in many protected areas (7). There is also an ongoing captive-breeding programme for the red-shanked douc at the Endangered Primate Rescue Center at Cuc Phuong National Park in Vietnam (9). In addition the Douc Langur Foundation has been undertaking comprehensive surveys of this species in an effort to understand the distribution of populations which is vital for any successful conservation programme. The Foundation\xe2\x80\x99s studies are also helping to uncover greater knowledge of this still poorly understood primate such as group size and composition and social interactions (10). WWF\xe2\x80\x99s Indochina Programme is also carrying out vital research into the effectiveness of national parks within Vietnam and trains reserve rangers in primate survey techniques (11). The effective enforcement of existing laws and national parks will be the key to ensuring the future of this attractive and appealing primate (7). ,loss;hunting;pet; ,cites;protection law;protected;wwf; ,3,4

Owing to a burgeoning human population in the region squatters are also posing an additional threat to its habitat while nest predation by alien predators has become a problem more recently (3). If further habitat loss and degradation continues this highly specialised species is at high risk of going extinct (2) (3). However recent surveys have shown that its range may extend further than previously estimated and as a result its conservation status may warrant downlisting to Endangered in the future (2) (5).,Although small amounts of restinga habitat are protected within three designated areas enforcement has been relatively ineffective with clearance of vegetation still occurring within the reserves\xe2\x80\x99 boundaries (2) (3). Fortunately conservation efforts have proliferated in recent years particularly since SAVE Brasil appointed local NGO <em>Pingo D'\xc3\xa1gua</em> BirdLife Species Guardian for the restinga antwren. This valuable partnership is supporting further research into the restinga antwren\xe2\x80\x99s ecology as well as an awareness campaign aimed at local schools the preparation of a Species Action Plan the removal of alien predators such as the common marmoset and the creation of a new reserve which will afford far greater protection to the area then currently exists (2) (3) (7) (9).

Rodrigues brush-warbler,Acrocephalus rodericanus,Rodrigues warbler (Acrocephalus rodericanus),Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Sylviidae,Acrocephalus (1),11 â 13 g (2),During the 1950s and 60s the natural habitat of Rodrigues Island was extensively cleared for timber firewood and farming (5) (6) leaving it one of the most degraded tropical oceanic islands in the world (4) and significantly decreasing the warbler population (5).  Then in 1968 one of the most severe cyclones to ever have hit Rodrigues struck and with a search in 1969 failing to find any warblers it was thought to have wiped out one of the island\xe2\x80\x99s <strong>endemic</strong> birds (5).  Thankfully the species had not gone extinct and numbers have since recovered slightly primarily due to an increase in forest cover through habitat protection and <strong>afforestation</strong> (5).,The slow recovery of the Rodrigues warbler since 1969 has been the result of efforts to protect the island\xe2\x80\x99s watersheds which allowed the surrounding forests to mature and recover and a switch to the use of bottled gas for cooking lessening the demand for firewood (5) (6).  Nature has also played a role in this species\xe2\x80\x99 recovery with a recent absence of catastrophic cyclones allowing populations to increase (6).  While much of the reforestation has involved exotic trees native species are being replanted in some areas including two Conservation Management Areas where grazing animals and woodcutters are kept out and exotic plants are removed (6).  Exotic plant species are a major cause of the lack of native habitat on the island but these introduced trees and shrubs also provide a vital haven for the Rodrigues warbler in the absence of native forest.  For the native forest to regenerate it is considered necessary to remove all exotic tree species but this may have a short-term detrimental impact on warbler populations.  Hopefully the long-term benefit to the island and to the Rodrigues warbler will outweigh this short-term loss (5).  To mitigate the potential catastrophic effects of another introduced predator catastrophic cyclone or drought the possibility of introducing the warblers to a small predator-free island has also been considered and feasibility studies have been undertaken (5). , , ,0,0

The eggs and tadpoles of Romer\xe2\x80\x99s treefrog are vulnerable to predation by the introduced mosquitofish (<em>Gambusia affinis</em>) as well as to predation by other frogs (2) (5).,Romer\xe2\x80\x99s treefrog is one of three amphibian species listed under the Hong Kong Wild Animals Protection Ordinance which prohibits the hunting wilful disturbance possession sale or export of this species (2) (3) (4). A major population stronghold for Romer\xe2\x80\x99s treefrog Ngong Ping in Lantau has been designated a Site of Special Scientific Interest (1) (2).

The successful eradication of rabbits and goats and the very slow reforestation on Round Island led to a steady increase in numbers over the last decades (2).,A captive breeding programme has taken place at the Durrell Wildlife Conservation Trust (formerly Jersey Wildlife Preservation Trust) but is no longer run (5).

Vast tracts of native forest (over 90%) have been cleared to make way for agriculture and on Round Island the introduction of rabbits and goats has further damaged native flora (7); however these were removed during the 1980\xe2\x80\x99s. Perhaps 500 adults remain (with a total population of approximately 1000 individuals) on the 159-hectare Round Island (1). ,Round Island is a protected area and visitors to the island are restricted to scientists and conservationists (5). Rabbits and goats have been eradicated and the native vegetation of the island much of which is itself <strong>endemic</strong> and endangered is beginning to recover. The Government of Mauritius and the Mauritian Wildlife Foundation are also running an intensive habitat restoration programme (1). International trade is prohibited by the listing of this snake on Appendix I of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (4). A captive breeding programme has been established with the aim of safeguarding the future of this rare snake and learning more about its complex biology (2). The Round Island keel-scaled boa is one of two snakes to be found only on this island belonging to an ancient line that dates back over 60 million years (7). Its relative <i>Bolyeria multocarinata</i> however has not been seen in the wild since 1975 and is feared to be extinct (2).  ,loss; ,captive breeding;protected; ,1,2

Although less studied than other griffons these declines are known to have been caused by agriculture encroaching on their habitat large-scale incidental poisoning and persecution (2) (6). In West Africa Rueppell\xe2\x80\x99s griffon has been heavily exploited for use in Black Magic (7).,Rueppell\xe2\x80\x99s griffon occurs in a number of protected areas throughout its range including Serengeti National Park Tanzania; a World Heritage Site and an important feeding area for the griffon (8). The continued protection of these areas is important for preventing greater declines of Rueppell\xe2\x80\x99s griffon as is establishing legal protection particularly in West Africa in an effort to reduce levels of exploitation (6). , ,protected; ,0,1
Animalia,Myiarchus semirufus,Rufous flycatcher (Myiarchus semirufus),Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Tyrannidae,Myiarchus (1),ca. 21 - 25 g (3),The rufous flycatcher has undergone a decline in both numbers and distribution and its small population restricted to a tiny and fragmented range makes it particularly vulnerable to extinction. The main threat to the species is the increasing human population in the region bringing with it an increase in grazing pressure overcollection of firewood and the deliberate killing of flycatchers which predate bees at the hives of local bee-keepers. In some areas the cutting of live wood is prohibited but this has led to an increased demand for dead wood which may reduce the availability of cavity nest sites for this species (2).,Further survey work is needed to clarify the current distribution and status of the rufous flycatcher and may well reveal that it is more widespread and common than previously believed (2). However no specific conservation actions are known to be in place for the species although it is reported to occur in the Pomac Forest Historical Sanctuary (Santuario Historico Bosque de Pomac) (2) and within the Chaparri Private Conservation Area a community owned and managed private reserve (6). Habitat protection and the banning of grazing and of firewood collection in <i>Prosopsis</i> and <i>Acacia</i> woodland together with raising awareness of the species\xe2\x80\x99 plight and encouraging bee-keepers not to kill flycatchers will also be needed to protect this <strong>endemic</strong> flycatcher from extinction (2). , , ,0,0

The island has the largest known nickel deposits in the world\xa0(9) and land clearance for mining is the greatest threat both to <em>Araucaria rulei</em> and to the many other <strong>endemic</strong> conifers which are often restricted to the mineral-rich areas from which the nickel ore is obtained. In addition to causing widespread deforestation mining activities have also resulted in large waste heaps and increased erosion\xa0(1)\xa0(2)\xa0(6)\xa0(7)\xa0(9). Further threats to the native vegetation include human-generated wildfires which are often started deliberately to clear brush as well as agriculture livestock grazing and the spread of invasive exotic species\xa0(6)\xa0(7)\xa0(8)\xa0(9)\xa0(10).,New Caledonia is considered a biodiversity \xe2\x80\x98hotspot\xe2\x80\x99 having for its size a remarkably unique and diverse flora and fauna\xa0(8)\xa0(9) (10). Of the 3000 or so plant species over 74 percent\xa0are <strong>endemic</strong>\xa0(8)\xa0(9) as are all but one of 44 conifer species\xa0(6)\xa0(9). Two thirds of the world\xe2\x80\x99s <em>Araucaria</em> species are also unique to this island\xa0(2)\xa0(5)\xa0(9). However the protected area network on New Caledonia is not currently representative of this diversity and most of the island\xe2\x80\x99s native plants including <em>Araucaria rulei</em> do not occur in any protected areas. In addition very few existing reserves are covered by any mining regulations\xa0(8)\xa0(9). Conservation priorities therefore include the expansion of New Caledonia\xe2\x80\x99s protected area network with the creation of new more representative reserves as well as a ban on mining within these areas\xa0(6)\xa0(7)\xa0(8)\xa0(9). More effective fire control public education programmes the control of invasive species and the potential development of ecotourism have also been recommended\xa0(6)\xa0(7)\xa0(9). ,loss;invasive; ,protected; ,2,1

As with many islands in the region little of the original forest cover may now remain (7). This species is not thought to be very tolerant of habitat disturbance and its small and highly fragmented range puts it at even greater risk of extinction (1) but little information is available on its exact status (2).,There are not known to be any specific conservation measures currently in place for this poorly-known mammal.

Habitat loss is the main threat to this bird (2) with the island it inhabits losing 75 percent of its native vegetation cover since 1946 (7).  Cultivation and urbanisation have eliminated native forest from all but the steepest of slopes (2) and the high level of human population growth and economic development on R\xc3\xa9union Island has resulted in an increase in urbanisation road construction and tourism causing further habitat destruction (2) (4).  The natural habitat is also degraded by exotic plants making the land more susceptible to the impacts of cyclones heavy rains and fires (2).,There are a number of protected areas on R\xc3\xa9union Island and it is vital that the remaining suitable habitat for the R\xc3\xa9union harrier is protected from further degradation and that public awareness campaigns are developed in order to stop poaching and persecution (2) (7).

However the region is also characterised by having some of the rarest snake species in the world many of which including the Saint Lucia racer are extremely close to extinction (12). Once widespread across the island of Saint Lucia and the neighbouring Maria Islands the introduction of small Asian mongooses (<em>Herpestes javanicus</em>) \xa0initiated a dramatic decline resulting in the complete extirpation of the species from the mainland restricting the species to its present day distribution (9) (13). As a ground dwelling diurnal snake the Saint Lucia racer is particularly vulnerable to predation by mongooses and consequently it now occupies a vulnerable position with a population that is critically small (5) (9) (13). \xa0,Facing the very real threat of extinction the survival of the Saint Lucia racer is dependant upon the implementation of major conservation measures. As it is restricted to the very small island of Maria Major along with a further six reptiles four of which\xa0 are Saint Lucian <strong>endemics</strong> the Saint Lucian government declared the Maria islands a nature reserve in 1982 (5) (14). As a direct result of this reserve wardens have been employed to take tourist tours to the island and to monitor activities on the island thus generating funds for conservation and ensuring the island\xe2\x80\x99s fragile environment is preserved (5). The Saint Lucia National Trust has also operated tours to the island with plans to revive this and efforts are underway to prevent exotic species establishing on the islands (5) (14).\xa0 , , ,0,0
RÃ¢le d'Olivier,Amaurornis olivieri,Sakalava rail (Amaurornis olivieri),Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Gruiformes,Rallidae,Amaurornis (1),Length: 19 cm (2),Based on surveys conducted between 2003 and 2004 it is tentatively estimated that the Sakalava rail population numbers between 100 and 200 birds. For a species with so few individuals the rapid degradation and destruction of Madagascar\xe2\x80\x99s bio-diverse wetlands poses a very serious threat to its long-term survival. In Madagascar human encroachment and conversion of habitat for rice cultivation is widely responsible for a massive reduction in the area of wetlands. For the Sakalava rail the introduction of non-native fish and a decline in reed habitat partially attributable to harvesting by humans is likely to be having an additional negative impact (2). Fortunately the Sakalava rail is considered too small for hunting and in some areas it is even traditionally taboo to collect its eggs (2) (3).,In January 2007 the Madagascar government passed legislation granting the protection of the Mahavavy-Kinkony Wetlands a 300000 hectare wildlife area and home to all of western Madagascar\xe2\x80\x99s wetland birds including the Sakalava rail (5). Further to the statutory protection of such a large area of Sakalava rail habitat it is hoped that in the near future a national conservation plan specific to the species will be established. For the development of such a plan it is vital to gain a greater understanding of its ecology and distribution. Given that there are many areas with suitable habitat that have not yet been surveyed there is some optimism that the Sakalava rail population may be larger than the current estimates suggest (2). ,hunting; , ,1,0
saker,Falco cherrug,Saker falcon (Falco cherrug),Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Falconiformes,Falconidae,Falco (1),Male length: 45 cm(2)Female length: 55 cm (2)Male wingspan: 100 - 110 cm (2)Female wingspan: 120 - 130 cm (2)Male weight: 730 - 990 g (2)Female weight: 970 - 1300 g (2),The saker falcon has undergone a rapid decline in recent years particularly in the Middle East and Asia due to trapping for the falconry trade and now faces the very real threat of extinction (6). Of those captured for the falconry trade the vast majority are thought to be young females creating a major age and sex bias in the wild population that dramatically reduces its breeding potential (2) (6). Females are preferred by falconers due to their larger size and young birds because they are easier to train than adults (2). In Europe the saker falcon is mainly threatened by the loss and degradation of <strong>steppe</strong> and dry grassland habitat due to agricultural expansion and declines in sheep pastoralism which has in turn reduced the sakavailability of key prey species and suitable hunting ground (6). Across the bird\xe2\x80\x99s range declines are also the result of predation (by eagle owls steppe eagles and golden eagles) human persecution electrocution shooting poaching and accidental poisoning through pesticides which contaminate the falcon\xe2\x80\x99s prey (2) (6) (7). In some parts of its range rodent plagues result in the extensive use of poisons to control them causing the indiscriminate deaths of many raptors that feed on them (5) (7).,The saker falcon is protected across much of its range particularly in Eastern Europe where controls of illegal trade were implemented in various countries in the 1990s (6). There have been concerted conservation efforts in Europe and intensive patrolling and management has even produced a steadily rising population in Hungary (5) (6). The species is listed on Appendix II of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) and in 2002 CITES imposed a trade ban on the United Arab Emirates (3). However more needs to be done to monitor illegal trade which evidently continues and to enforce regulations against it. Certain countries including the United Arab Emirates have reduced the demand for wild-caught birds by captive breeding \xe2\x80\x98farmed\xe2\x80\x99 saker falcons to trade to falconers instead (6). A programme to erect artificial nest platforms in the Mongolian steppe is proving a significant conservation measure for the breeding saker falcon population (7). Constructing artificial nests prevents the falcon constructing nests on electricity pylons during which many are electrocuted (8). In addition a number of research programmes have also been established to learn more about the distribution population and ecology of this species in addition to the threats facing it which should help to inform appropriate conservation efforts and management strategies in the future (6). ,loss;hunting;poaching; ,cites;captive breeding;protected; ,3,3

Increased sediment in streams and fragmentation of this species\xe2\x80\x99 vital habitat are also contributing to the declining population of <em>Salmo peristericus </em>(2).,Part of <em>Salmo peristericus\xe2\x80\x99s</em> range is encompassed by a National Park and angling in the region is regulated according to the National law (1). ,fragmentation;poaching;pollution; , ,3,0
red-bellied harvest mouse; salt marsh harvest mouse,Reithrodontomys raviventris,Saltmarsh harvest mouse (Reithrodontomys raviventris),Animalia,Chordata,Mammalia,Rodentia,Cricetidae,Reithrodontomys (1),7.6 - 14.5 g (3),The saltmarshes inhabited by this small mouse have undergone widespread destruction and degradation with many filled in for development or agriculture diked or used for commercial salt production. Groundwater pumping has also caused subsidence and increased flooding reducing the extent of pickleweed while predicted rising sea levels present a further flood risk (1) (2) (4) (8) (9). Most of the marshes have now been reduced to long narrow strips along outboard dikes lacking essential vegetation cover on higher ground. Pollution management for wildfowl invasive plants such as cordgrass (<i>Spartina</i>) and changes in water quality such as an influx of fresh water from sewage treatment have also changed the vegetation composition (1) (3) (4) (7) (8) (12). Finally within altered marshes the saltmarsh harvest mouse is at greater risk of predation by domestic cats and non-native red foxes (1) (4) and may suffer competition with the California vole (<i>Microtus californicus</i>) (13).,The saltmarsh harvest mouse is listed as Endangered by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (11) and occurs in a number of protected areas (1) (4) (8) (11) although many may not be large enough or have features suitable to its long-term survival (1) (8). A recovery plan for the species was completed in 1984 with the aim of protecting enhancing and restoring marsh habitat and undertaking further research into the species and its requirements (10) (14) and a Tidal Marsh Ecosystem Recovery Plan which will include this species is currently under development (1) (7). Some efforts are underway to preserve saltmarsh habitat for example through the removal of invasive <i>Spartina</i> (12) but a range of further measures will be needed including the effective protection and management of remaining marshland and more research into the saltmarsh harvest mouse if this unique rodent is to survive in the long-term (1) (8). ,invasive;pet;pollution; ,protected; ,3,1

Since lungless salamanders need a damp environment to maintain the moist skin on which oxygen uptake depends (4) any alteration in moisture conditions poses a severe threat. Therefore although it still survives in shaded plantations and sugarcane fields any clearance of these to create more open drier habitats would have a negative impact on this species (1). Similarly climate change may also pose a threat and already appears to be causing dramatic declines in other Central American salamanders (12). Although there is not yet any direct evidence that the fungal disease chytridiomycosis has contributed to these declines its role in the decline of many other amphibian species suggests that it may also be a potential threat (12).,No specific conservation measures are currently known to be in place for Salvin\xe2\x80\x99s mushroomtongue salamander but the maintenance of shaded habitats has been identified as being important to its long-term survival (1). The species may potentially occur within the Parque Nacional El Imposible in El Salvador although this is not yet confirmed. It is not currently known from any protected areas in Guatemala but a number of protected areas have been proposed within its range and may benefit the species in the future (1). ,loss;fragmentation;environment;disease; ,protected; ,4,1

The introduction of invasive plants and animals and an increase in the size of the human population has contributed to the loss and degradation of large areas of habitat on San Cristobal. Furthermore feral rats and cats are thought likely to be responsible for high rates of predation on mockingbird nests and there is a growing threat of avian parasites and diseases spreading to mockingbirds from local chicken farms (2).,For their unique biological diversity and significance the Galapagos Islands are designated both a National Park and a World Heritage Site (2). As a consequence conservation of the islands\xe2\x80\x99 native fauna and flora is a high priority. One of the priorities for the conservation of the San Cristobal mockingbird to conduct further research to identify which factors are of greatest threat to the species so that appropriate conservation action can be taken (2). ,loss;invasive;disease; , ,3,0

Acklinâs ground iguana; San Salvador ground iguana; San Salvador rock iguana; Watling Island iguana; White Cay ground iguana,Cyclura rileyi,San Salvador iguana (Cyclura rileyi),Animalia,Chordata,Reptilia,Squamata,Iguanidae,Cyclura (1),up to 1.25 kg (2),<i>Cyclura rileyi</i> is amongst the most threatened of the West Indian rock iguanas with two of its three recognised subspecies being listed as critically endangered by the IUCN and the third as endangered (6). One of the most devastating impacts has been the large-scale habitat destruction by European and American colonialists who cleared forests for conversion to agriculture and introduced many non-native plants and animals (6). The San Salvador iguana now has a relatively remote distribution away from most human settlements but a large and varied range of threats nevertheless continue to make their prospects of long-term survival tenuous (4) (8).,Since a number of surrounding cays as well as the mainland of San Salvador have very similar habitat to that currently used by the species reintroductions to parts of the iguana\xe2\x80\x99s former range are a viable and important focus of conservation efforts (4). An introduced population of Acklin\xe2\x80\x99s iguanas (<i>C. r. nuchalis</i>) currently thrives on an island within the Exumas Land and Sea Park (6) and a successful translocation of five adult pairs of <i>C. r. rileyi</i> from Green Cay to Cut Cay took place in February 2005 funded by a 2004 grant from the International Iguana Foundation (7). Candidate cays for further reintroductions (and source of animals) include Barn Cay (from Guana Cay) Cato Cay (from Green Cay) and High Cay (from Low Cay). Corrective actions may first be required to render each cay suitable for reintroduction (e.g. removal of feral rats) and reintroduction of iguanas on the mainland should be undertaken only if large areas are protected particularly from the feral dogs and cats that are already numerous in local areas (4). ,poaching;disease; ,protected; ,2,1

The likely extinction of the sandhill dunnart from the Northern Territory corresponds to a reduction of over 50 percent in its overall range (5) and its distribution populations and habitat are continuing to decline (1). There are now believed to be fewer than 2500 mature sandhill dunnarts left in the wild and over recent years its total population has decreased by over 20 percent (1).,The sandhill dunnart is listed as \xe2\x80\x98endangered\xe2\x80\x99 under the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 which provides a framework for the protection and management of Australian wildlife (5).

Having such a small and restricted range accentuates this problem. Hunting and trapping for food or the pet trade also constitute a significant threat to Sanford\xe2\x80\x99s brown lemur (2).,Sanford\xe2\x80\x99s brown lemur occurs in three protected areas and a fourth the forests of Daraina soon to be officially declared a protected area (3). However poaching and brush fires are fairly common events in many of Madagascar\xe2\x80\x99s nature reserves and protection needs to be increased. Only a handful of captive bred populations of this lemur exist around the world (5). The fate of this lemur will most probably be determined by the future of its forest habitat which needs to be better preserved if the survival of this species is to be safeguarded. ,hunting;pet; ,protected; ,2,1

Ever since the Portuguese settled on the island in 1479 large areas of forest have been lost as land was converted for agriculture such as sugar coffee and cocoa plantations (2) (3). More recent deforestation is attributable to the construction of houses and gardens(1). Today it is largely the remote and inaccessible areas of forest that remain untouched (3).,As extremely little is known about this species there is a great need for studies to establish its abundance and distribution and to better understand the threats it faces (1).

In spite of intensive searches executed by various experienced herpetologists only a handful of the historical localities could be verified (5) and it is feared that this species is the rarest and most threatened salamander in Europe (7).<br/>\r\nThere are three probable causes for the decline of <i>E. platycephalus</i>:<br/>\r\n(a) Treatment of water bodies with DDT in the 1950's in the battle against malaria.<br/>\r\n(b) The introduction of trout which may be a threat to the salamanders themselves or compete with the salamanders for food.<br/>\r\n(c) The reduction of water levels due to increasing demand for water from both the tourism and agricultural industries (5).,No specific conservation measurements are being taken for the Sardinian brook newt. However the Habitats Directive strictly protects this species and protected habitats are being proposed to the EU-Commission by Italy (4).

Clanwilliam sawfin,Barbus serra,Sawfin (Barbus serra),Animalia,Chordata,Actinopterygii,Cypriniformes,Cyprinidae,Barbus (1),up to 7 kg (3),Once widespread and abundant throughout the Olifants River system (2) recent surveys found that sawfin numbers are now dangerously low and it has disappeared entirely from parts of the main stem of the Olifants River (4).  This has been caused by introduced predatory fish primarily the smallmouth bass (<i>Micropterus dolomieu</i>) in addition to habitat degradation and fragmentation (2).  As the Olifants River region experiences hot dry summers water is extracted from the main river and its tributaries to irrigate the surrounding agricultural land.  Impoundments are also constructed to store water after the winter rainy season.  Furthermore river beds are bulldozed into wide channels to prevent the adjacent land from being flooded in the rainy season (2).  Such activities greatly alter the habitat of the sawfin and restrict its ability to move freely between different areas.,CapeNature a public institution responsible for biodiversity in the Western Cape (5) classifies the sawfin as endangered which makes it an offence to remove captured fish from rivers and dams.  CapeNature also undertakes regular surveys of the Olifants River system and has successfully cultured the sawfin since 1994.  Juveniles are then introduced to suitable natural habitats or stocked into farm dams to establish refuge populations.  Small parts of the sawfin\xe2\x80\x99s range fall within protected areas including the Cedarberg Matjies River and Oorlogskloof Nature Reserves (2).  However to ensure the sawfin\xe2\x80\x99s future it is vital to protect the habitat in the specific tributaries and the small section of the Olifants River mainstream where the sawfin remains abundant.  In addition efforts to prevent further introductions of alien predatory fish species are imperative (2). ,fragmentation; ,protected; ,1,1

Animalia,Mergus squamatus,Scaly-sided merganser (Mergus squamatus),Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Anseriformes,Anatidae,Mergus (1),Size: 52 â 58 cm (2),This rare stunning bird has undergone significant declines as a result of habitat destruction persecution and disturbance. Populations suffered badly in Russia in the 1960s and 1970s when a period of intense economic development led to extensive habitat destruction and alteration. Thankfully large scale deforestation in river valleys has since been banned and the rapid decline in this species\xe2\x80\x99 population was halted (5). Nevertheless a variety of other threats still affect the scaly-sided merganser in Russia including forest fires illegal hunting drowning in fishermens' nets disturbance from motor boats during the breeding season river pollution and natural predators (2) (5). In China breeding populations continue to decline rapidly in the face of deforestation illegal hunting human disturbance and the use of poisons and/or explosives for fishing and have disappeared from much of their former range (2).,The scaly-sided merganser is a Nationally Protected Species (First Class) in China a protected species (category 1) in North Korea and a protected species in South Korea (5). This bird can also be found in a number of protected areas in both its breeding and wintering range notably Sikhote-Alin' State Biosphere Reserve in Russia and Changbai Shan Nature Reserve in China (2) (5). A number of studies of this species have been conducted including research that has shown females readily use artificial nest boxes with several returning to breed in the same boxes in subsequent years. Over 130 artificial nest boxes have been erected alongside Russian rivers (8) which not only increase the availability of nest sites and therefore breeding capacity but also provide a valuable opportunity to study the breeding biology of this rare duck. ,hunting;fishing;pollution; ,protected; ,3,1

An intensive commercial fur trade from 1740 until about 1900 resulted in the sea otter being harvested almost to extinction and by 1900 the sea otter was so rare that commercial harvesting was forced to cease (6). Sea otters were protected by an international treaty in 1911. Since then numbers have recovered to an extent but human activities especially coastal development and marine pollution now pose a threat to the sea otter (6). In 1989 hundreds and possibly thousands of sea otters were killed as a direct result of the Exxon Valdez oil spill in Prince William Sound in Alaska (4). The possibility of another major oil spill poses a continual threat to the sea otter and could have devastating consequences. Additional threats include entanglement in fishing gear particularly gill nets and competition with commercial fisheries for food (6). In the central Aleutian Islands Alaska sea otters have declined by as much as 90 percent (4). Evidence indicates that this drastic decline is the result of increased predation by killer whales which have switched to consuming more sea otters following the collapse of Steller\xe2\x80\x99s sea lion and harbour seal populations in the region (4).,The sea otter is legally protected in the United States under the Marine Mammal Protection Act and in Canada sea otters are protected under the Species at Risk Act (10). Despite protection and various conservation measures the Californian population has been slow to recover; a new Recovery Plan by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service was currently being developed with the aim of managing damaging human activities to enable the population to recover to a point where it can be removed from the List of Endangered and Threatened Wildlife (11). There have been several successful reintroduction attempts along the west coast of North America restoring this highly appealing animal to much of its former range (2). ,fishing;pet;pollution; ,protected; ,3,1

This species was then relentlessly hunted in the 1960s and 70s (8) before the International Moratorium on Commercial Whaling came into effect in 1986 (9). At present the species is vulnerable to chemical and noise pollution (8).,In 1976 this whale received protected status (8) and the moratorium on commercial whaling took effect from 1986 (9). There are ongoing problems with the moratorium however and Iceland announced in 2001 that it might soon resume commercial whaling of sei minke and fin whales (8). Other countries also oppose the ban and the future of endangered species such as the sei whale is not yet secure (5). ,pollution; ,protected; ,1,1

Central Asian salamander; Siberian salamander,Ranodon sibiricus,Semirechensk salamander (Ranodon sibiricus),Animalia,Chordata,Amphibia,Caudata,Hynobiidae,Ranodon (1),Length: up to 25 cm (2),The specific habitat requirements of the Semirechensk salamander mean that it is vulnerable to any changes which occur within its habitat such as deforestation over-grazing and soil erosion (1) (3) (4). Land use changes have lead to the desiccation of its aquatic habitat on which it is dependent for reproduction and feeding. The scarcity of suitable habitats has lead to the range of the Semirechensk salamander becoming severely fragmented and populations becoming disjointed (1). Local fishing practices involving the diversion of streams have also resulted in reductions in certain populations of the Semirechensk salamander (1) (3).,The Semirechensk salamander is listed in the Red Data Books of the USSR and Kazakhstan and is listed as a protected species in the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region in China. Only part of the Semirechensk salamander\xe2\x80\x99s range is thought to fall within a protected area although its presence there is unconfirmed. Current conservation efforts are thought to be insufficient to protect this endangered amphibian but the creation of strictly protected areas could be an effective conservation measure to ensure the future survival of this endangered amphibian (1).\xa0 ,fishing; ,protected; ,1,1

Since the species has such a small population and restricted range of just 230 square kilometres the owl has been officially classified on the IUCN Red List as Endangered (2) (6). These are both declining due to habitat loss and degradation (3).,The Serendib scops-owl is found in five protected areas each administered as a Forest Reserve or a Proposed Reserve by the Forest Department of Sri Lanka (2). However further population surveys are required to better understand the abundance and distribution of this species which for so long managed to elude detection in its forest home.

Merle dyal des Seychelles,Copsychus sechellarum,Seychelles magpie robin (Copsychus sechellarum),Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Muscicapidae,Copsychus (1),Length: 18 - 25 cm (2),This bird has been affected by habitat loss and degradation following the colonisation of the Seychelles by humans (3). In addition predation by introduced species such as cats and brown rats (<i>Rattus norvegicus</i>) and competition with the introduced common myna (<i>Acridotheres tristis</i>) may have also been responsible for the dramatic decline in the magpie robin (2). At present the very low population size means that the species is extremely vulnerable both to chance events and to the problems associated with <strong>inbreeding</strong>.,Since 1990 Birdlife International has operated a Seychelles Magpie Robin Recovery Programme and the RSPB joined this effort in 1998 (6). Birds have been introduced to small predator-free islands and a predator eradication programme is being initiated on Fr\xc3\xa9gate Island (2). Breeding success has been boosted through a number of measures such as the creation of habitat and supplementary feeding and a genetic study is currently underway to investigate <strong>inbreeding</strong> (2).

Scops-owl territories at lower altitudes or outside protected areas are under threat from forest clearance for housing development and timber exploitation.  Ecotourism and the associated disturbance of luring the scops-owl into view by playing recordings of its call may also affect some populations (5).  Other potential threats include introduced predators such as cats rats and barn owls (2) although the impact they may have on the scops-owl is yet to be determined (5) (7).,The Seychelles scops owl is listed on Appendix II of the Convention of International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) which means that any trade in this species should be tightly controlled (3).  It is also protected by law in the Seychelles under the Wild Animals and Bird Protection Act (5).  A large proportion of the scops-owl\xe2\x80\x99s range lies within the Morne Seychellois National Park; the planned creation of a second protected area south of this National Park would result in approximately 80 percent of its range being protected from development and habitat loss and would greatly improve the species\xe2\x80\x99 protection (7).  A monitoring programme was set up in 1997 but as yet no information on population trends is available.  It is important that monitoring of the population continues long-term (7).  The first baseline survey of this species was conducted in 2000 and 2001 and resulted in the Seychelles scops-owl being downlisted from Critically Endangered to Endangered on the IUCN Red List in 2004 on the basis of population size (1) (7). ,loss; ,cites;protected; ,1,2

The Seychelles wolf snake is preyed on by the tenrec (<i>Tenrec ecaudatus</i>) an opportunistic feeder that was introduced to the islands of Mah\xc3\xa9 and Praslin probably as a source of food (1) (2) while another introduced species <i>Cinnamomum verum</i> is impacting the snake\xe2\x80\x99s habitat (1).  Introduced to the islands in 1772 and subsequently spreading so rapidly that by the end of the 19th century extensive forests of this plant existed (5) this cinnamon plant continues to invade and degrade native forests (1).   The fairly restricted distribution of this species makes it particularly susceptible to the impacts of any threats it faces (1).,The Seychelles wolf snake occurs in a number of protected areas throughout its range including Morne Seychellois and Praslin National Parks and Aride Special Reserve (1).  However a significant population on Silhouette Island does not occur in any protected area and it has therefore been recommended that a national park or reserve should be established in order to protect this population (1). ,invasive; ,protected; ,1,1

Anthus sharpei,Macronyx sharpei,Sharpeâs longclaw (Macronyx sharpei),Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Motacillidae,Macronyx (1),Length: 16 â 17 cm (2),The specific habitat requirements of Sharpe\xe2\x80\x99s longclaw make it very sensitive to changes in grassland cover and quality (4). Since human settlement in 1964 the Kinangop Plateau has been primarily used for dairy farming which retains grassland as pasture but now landowners are showing a preference for crop-farming over livestock-farming. As a result grassland is being rapidly converted into cultivated land (5). Tussock grasslands now cover only about a quarter of the plateau and many of the patches are too small to support a population of Sharpe\xe2\x80\x99s longclaw. Increasing human populations will lead to further loss and fragmentation of grassland habitats and it is predicted that by 2010 tussock grasslands will have diminished to cover only about one-fifth of the plataeau (4).,The highland grasses of Kenya occur almost entirely on private land with no formal protection. The conservation of grassland is critical to the conservation of Sharpe\xe2\x80\x99s longclaw but it will only survive if the habitat is managed in a way that is in harmony with the needs of the landowners. With a preference for crop-farming over livestock farming landowner\xe2\x80\x99s interests seem incompatible with grassland conservation. However a survey in 1996 showed that a substantial proportion of landowners were prepared to consider opportunities to enhance the area\xe2\x80\x99s conservation value (5). A local conservation action group \xe2\x80\x98Friends of Kinangop Plateau\xe2\x80\x99 is campaigning for an initiative that encourages production of food crops from small gardens without having to convert large grassland areas (4). Improving milk processing facilities to make dairy farming more appealing and providing landowners with economic incentives to maintain grassland habitat are proposed measures that will help protect the Sharpe\xe2\x80\x99s longclaw and other species of Kenya\xe2\x80\x99s grasslands (3). ,loss;fragmentation; , ,2,0

Sharks used to be specifically targeted by Ecuadorian fishing communities; however this was banned in 2004. Nevertheless catch statistics are poorly documented and there is inadequate monitoring of fishing activities (1).,There is little management of fisheries in Ecuador; however a recently introduced national action plan for the protection of sharks which aims to reduce the numbers of sharks caught as <strong>bycatch</strong> as well as increasing the number of Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) off Ecuador from 13 to 15 should hopefully aid shark population recovery in this area (1) (5). ,fishing; ,protected; ,1,1
Animalia,Thinornis novaeseelandiae,Shore plover (Thinornis novaeseelandiae),Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Charadriiformes,Charadriidae,Thinornis (1),60 g (2),Predation by introduced cats and rats caused the original precipitous decline of shore plover numbers from mainland coasts and from the other Chatham Islands (3). The population on Rangatira Island was itself decimated by human collectors who took hundreds of specimens for scientific purposes at the beginning of the 20th Century (2). Today the shore plover is extremely vulnerable as the species is mainly restricted to a single island; the accidental introduction of predators or a natural disaster has the potential to completely wipe out this species (2). However the discovery in 1999 of a second small population and progress with the establishment of new populations in the Chathams and mainland New Zealand does provide slightly more stability for the species (5).,Conservation efforts to save the shore plover represent one of the first cases worldwide to establish new populations of a strong-flying shorebird (3). Rangatira Nature Reserve was established in 1954 (6) but the key to the survival of this species will be the creation of independent populations elsewhere. Relocations to other predator-free islands in the Chatham group initially failed due to these birds' strong homing instincts; individuals returned to Rangatira Island (6). A captive population is being held at the National Wildlife Centre at Mount Bruce and this provides birds for <strong>translocations</strong> to island locations off mainland New Zealand (4). Recent transfers to Mangere Nature Reserve (Mangere Island is also within the Chatham group) have been more successful; between 2001 and 2002 28 birds were relocated (5). As of September 2002 11 birds were present on Mangere Island and one chick had fledged successfully (5). The population of shore plovers on Rangatira Island is only around 123 birds (5) but sustained conservation efforts continue to produce encouraging results for the future of this attractive bird. , , ,0,0

The combination of these threats has reduced the population of silvery brown bare-face tamarins by over 50 percent in the last 18 years leaving the species in a precarious position where any further reduction could have a cataclysmic effect (2). \xa0,Currently there is only one reserve the Canon del Rio Alicante where the silvery brown bare-face tamarin can be found. However this area is poorly protected and the land has been exploited for the benefit of local people. Therefore a method of protecting this animal whilst allowing development in surrounding communities is needed.

Unfortunately urbanisation and agricultural activities are increasingly encroaching upon the species\xe2\x80\x99 habitat and consequently the species\xe2\x80\x99 habitat has dwindled and the population has declined (4). The principle agent behind this decline is the extraction of ground water for agriculture and human consumption causing breeding areas to dry up. Streams have also been dammed to form fish-farm ponds while pollutants seeping into the water table from septic tanks and sewer pipelines continue to degrade this rare species\xe2\x80\x99 habitat (4) (5). These threats are compounded by the species\xe2\x80\x99 short life span as two consecutive poor breeding seasons could wipe out a substantial portion of the remaining population (4) (6).,The future of the slackwater darter is very much dependant on the careful management of its habitat (4). The conservation objectives for this Endangered species are set out in a detailed recovery plan with the protection of both breeding and non-breeding habitat a key priority (6). Monitoring of water quality and surveys of population trends will also be required if the slackwater darter is to be saved (4). , , ,0,0

In 1990 only 5 \xe2\x80\x93 20 percent of dry forest in east Bahia remained having been steadily cleared for cattle pastures coffee plantations and firewood extraction (2).  Much of the remaining forest is apparently unsuitable for the slender antbird due to a high level of disturbance by livestock (3).,The slender antbird is protected by law in Brazil and since 2004 SAVE Brasil (Sociedade para a Conserva\xc3\xa7\xc3\xa3o das Aves do Brasil) the representative of Birdlife International in Brazil has been developing a conservation program for the slender antbird in Boa Nova (2) (3) (4). Since the project started the local community and landowners have become active participants in conservation activities in the region and even adopted the slender antbird as the symbol of Boa Nova (4). In addition the project has facilitated further research into the slender antbird\xe2\x80\x99s breeding behaviour and raised conservation awareness through campaigns workshops and educational material about the slender antbird and the biodiversity of Boa Nova (4) (6). Furthermore SAVE have developed a proposal for the creation of a 32000 hectare protected public area in the region (4). ,loss; ,protected; ,1,1

Rhim gazelle; sand gazelle,Gazella leptoceros,Slender-horned gazelle (Gazella leptoceros),Animalia,Chordata,Mammalia,Cetartiodactyla,Bovidae,Gazella (1),14 â 30 kg (3),As an occupant of particularly poor countries several of which have much civil unrest the slender-horned gazelle has suffered through habitat loss and warfare. It is hunted for meat and its horns are sold as ornaments (3). Unmanaged recreational hunting is a major threat throughout its range and the rapid expansion of disturbance and intrusion caused by desert tourism based on 4x4 and other forms of motorised transport also affects some of the remaining populations in North Africa (7).,A small number of slender-horned gazelle are in captivity around the world. All are part of an international captive breeding programme but are derived from a very small initial founder group of original wild-caught Tunisian stock (7) (8). There are also very small captive groups held by national conservation institutions in Algeria and Tunisia.  In the wild formation of the Djebil and Senghar National Parks in Tunisia and the Siwa protected area in western Egypt (all during the 1990s) are important initiatives in the conservation of this species (7). ,loss;hunting; ,captive breeding;protected; ,2,2

Plantae,Cypripedium formosanum,Slipper orchid (Cypripedium formosanum),Plantae,Tracheophyta,Liliopsida,Orchidales,Orchidaceae,Cypripedium (1),Stem height: 10 - 25 cm (2),Despite such an elaborate <strong>pollination</strong> strategy the actual reproductive success rate of slipper orchids is astoundingly low with only a small fraction of flowers ever producing seed (6). Considering the seeds that do develop are then dependant on a finely balanced relationship with a fungal partner it is no surprise that slipper orchids are vulnerable to poor regeneration particularly when disturbance is high (5). It does not help that because of their unusual and attractive flowers slipper orchids are highly sought after by collectors and horticulturalists (5) (6). In particular <i>Cypripedium formosanum</i> is considered by many to be the most beautiful species in the genus (2).,Fortunately <i>Cypripedium formosanum</i> is one of the easiest slipper orchids to grow from seed and is frequently seen in cultivation (2). As a result even though it is only protected on Appendix II of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) which technically allows wild specimens and artificially propagated specimens to be traded under a permit there is unlikely to be a significant demand for trade in wild plants (3) (7). Nonetheless in common with most <i>Cypripediums</i> very little is known about its population trends and status in the wild. This information is crucial to accurately establish how threatened the remaining wild population is and to enable the formation and implementation of conservation measures as necessary (2). , ,cites;protected; ,0,2

Big cats often turn to domestic stock as an alternative source of food and this can incite retaliation from local farmers (3). Snow leopard fur was once highly prized in the international fashion world and around 1000 pelts were traded a year in the 1920\xe2\x80\x99s (3). A further threat to this species comes from the increasing demand for bones for traditional Oriental medicine (3).,Snow leopards are protected throughout most of their range and international trade is banned by their listing on Appendix I of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) (5). The International Snow Leopard Trust and the Snow Leopard Conservancy are the world's two leading organizations dedicated specifically to conserving this endangered cat (6) (8). Both organisations have developed a multifaceted approach to the conservation of this species; involving research and data storage educational initiatives community-based conservation and the protection of livestock to prevent retributive killing of snow leopards (6) (8). Local people are involved in various initiatives and there are plans to link fragmented populations by habitat corridors (3) which may improve the chances of the long-term survival of this secretive and critically endangered cat. , ,cites;protected; ,0,2

The primary threat to this species is the persistent degradation of its habitat by introduced sheep. Sheep grazing has caused soil erosion and prevents the natural regeneration of the island\xe2\x80\x99s forests (6) (7). This has been most severe on the southern side of the island which is now largely treeless and supports very little birdlife (4). Consequently over the last 50 years the Socorro parakeet\xe2\x80\x99s habitat has contracted substantially. Predation by feral cats which were brought to the island in the 1950s is also a threat but at present it is unclear how significant this may be (4) (6) (7) (9).,The remote island of Socorro supports a unique diversity of birdlife including several <strong>endemic</strong> species and consequently is of high conservation importance (4). This island along with several others in the Revillagigedo chain was designated a biosphere reserve in 1994 and as a direct result of this several conservation measures have been implemented that aim to restore and preserve the island\xe2\x80\x99s landscape. Programmes have begun to remove sheep and feral cats from the island and should stimulate the regeneration of the forest whilst diminishing the threat of predation on the island\xe2\x80\x99s birds (6). The number of sheep on the island has already been successfully reduced to less than 300 with further culls planned (9) (10). Furthermore a nest-box provision programme for the Socorro parakeet has begun and a captive breeding programme has been established which will be used as a last ditch attempt to save the species if the natural population drops to critical levels (6) (10). , ,captive breeding; ,0,1

Petit-duc d'IrÃ¨ne,Otus ireneae,Sokoke scops-owl (Otus ireneae),Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Strigiformes,Strigidae,Otus (1),45 â 50 g (2),The Arabuko-Sokoke forest has been overexploited during recent years by commercial logging.  Commercial harvesting has not been regulated and coupled with rampant illegal exploitation has contributed to forest degradation and loss of biodiversity (5).  Within the Sokoke scops-owl\xe2\x80\x99s Tanzanian range the mountains support a high human population density which places enormous pressure on the land for subsistence agriculture.  In the past mechanical harvesting of timber caused much environmental damage but that has now stopped and today most timber is extracted using pit-sawing techniques where professional sawyers cut trees into planks on site and walk out the forest with sawn timber.  Whilst this is much less damaging almost all of this harvesting is illegal.  In addition firewood harvesting is extensive throughout the mountains and is particularly hard to regulate (6).  The harvesting of particular tree species is likely to have a great impact on the Sokoke scops-owl as <i>Brachylaena</i> trees provide essential nesting sites and <i>Cynometra</i> trees are important areas for roosting and foraging (4).,The Sokoke scops-owl is listed on Appendix II of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) which means that any trade in this species should be carefully regulated (3).  It has been the focus of a number of surveys (4) (7) and there are also measures in place in both parts of its range to conserve critical habitat.  The Arabuko-Sokoke forest was established as a reserve in 1943 and contains two nature reserves within it (8).  The Arabuko-Sokoke Forest Management Team has developed a Strategic Forest Management Plan which aims to have an intact and fully functioning forest ecosystem with no reduction in the existing forest area by 2027 (5).  In the East Usambaras the Tanzania Forest Conservation Group has been promoting conservation since 1993.  The project has assisted villagers to plant over one million trees establish three village forest reserves and have a greater understanding of forest conservation (9). ,loss;environmental;environment; ,cites; ,3,1

There has been widespread clearance of Bolivia\xe2\x80\x99s forests within this bird\xe2\x80\x99s altitudinal range for the cultivation of staple and export crops (2) such as coca and citrus fruits (7). Rural development road-building and hunting are also thought to have dramatically impacted the survival of this rare bird. In Peru oil exploration poses a threat to the species\xe2\x80\x99 habitat in addition to opening up the foothills to human colonisation and hunting (2).,Fortunately large parts of the southern helmeted curassow\xe2\x80\x99s current range are protected by Ambor\xc3\xb3 and Carrasco National Parks (2). A number of extensive surveys have been conducted in recent years (2) and continue with the hope that the information gained will help inform a long-term conservation programme (8). Sadly most surveys have met with little success in locating the species in many of the searched areas (2). However surveys conducted by a team from Asociacion Armon\xc3\xada (BirdLife in Bolivia) resulted in the remarkable rediscovery of the subspecies <i>C. u. koepckeae</i> in Peru in 2005 being the first observation of this bird in 36 years. This work has subsequently been followed up with an environmental awareness project involving educating local people about their unique bird and distributing T-shirts and notebooks that depict the curassow along with words that inspire pride in the local fauna and emphasise the need to preserve it (4). The project appears to have had some success with reports that there is a genuine enthusiasm amongst local people to protect their <strong>endemic</strong> bird now that they appreciated its global significance (4) which is a positive first step towards safeguarding its long-term survival. ,hunting; ,protected; ,1,1

In addition these large primates were an important food source for people in the region and have been widely hunted (4).,The muriqui has been a flagship species for the conservation of Brazil\xe2\x80\x99s fragile Atlantic Forest Region (8). Conservation efforts are still imperative and \xe2\x80\x9cProgramme Muriqui\xe2\x80\x9d will continue to undertake research on populations within the Serra dos Organos National Park; the possibility of reintroductions is being investigated and an ongoing education programme has been established (9). , , ,0,0
Chilean river otter; huillin,Lontra provocax,Southern river otter (Lontra provocax),Animalia,Chordata,Mammalia,Carnivora,Mustelidae,Lontra (1),5 - 10 kg (3),The southern river otter has disappeared from much of its original range as a result of habitat destruction and excessive hunting (1) (5) and it is now known from only around seven isolated areas (1). Historically the species was hunted for its highly priced fur and despite hunting now being illegal enforcement is often poor and illegal poaching is common (1) (3). Habitat loss and degradation also continue to be major threats as a result of dam construction the removal of vegetation along riverbanks river and stream canalisation drainage for agriculture and water pollution (1) (3) (5). Large-scale deforestation has also indirectly affected freshwater habitats causing severe flooding and the deposition of soil on river beds (1). There has also been some concern that the southern river otter may face competition from the introduced American mink <em>Mustela vison</em> although this is now believed to be less likely than previously feared (1) (3).,International trade in the southern river otter is banned under its listing on Appendix I of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) (4) and the species is also listed on Appendix I of the Convention on Migratory Species (CMS) (6). In Argentina important populations occur in Nahuel Huapi National Park Tierra del Fuego National Park and on Staten Island (1) (3) (7). Recommended conservation measures for the southern river otter include population monitoring improved control of poaching education measures and the maintenance of vegetation cover along shorelines. Reintroductions into parts of the species\xe2\x80\x99 former range have also been suggested provided that anti-poaching legislation is properly enforced (1) (3). The distribution of the southern river otter has been linked to the distribution of <strong>crustacean</strong> prey the presence of human habitation and the presence of introduced mink and further studies have been recommended to better understand the effects of these factors on the otter\xe2\x80\x99s conservation (7). ,loss;hunting;poaching;pet;pollution; ,cites; ,5,1

It occupies an area where there is a high human population meaning the threat of hunting for food the pet trade and for use in traditional medicine is prevalent. It is also threatened by habitat loss as most of its natural range has been heavily fragmented through logging and agricultural encroachment (7). As a result it is believed that the southern white-cheeked gibbon population has declined by 50 percent in the last 45 years (1).,This primate is protected from international trade as it is listed on Appendix I of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) meaning that trade in this species is only permitted in highly exceptional circumstances (3).

This population decline is due in part to competition with the mosquitofish (<em>Gambusia holbrooki</em>) (2); introduced by man to the region as a method of\xa0 controlling mosquito numbers this fish is one of the most invasive fish species worldwide (5). As a result the Spanish toothcarp is now restricted to bodies of water where the mosquitofish is absent (1).,The Spanish toothcarp has been the focus of a number of conservation actions.\xa0 A project in Catalonia running from 1996 until 2000 worked to conserve the toothcarp and other species and a captive breeding program resulted in 20000 Spanish toothcarps being released back into the wild (6). In Murcia conservation efforts have included the elimination of the invasive fish species habitat management and restoration and captive breeding of the Spanish toothcarp (7). However whilst introductions of captive bred individuals help boost population numbers of this species the threats to the Spanish toothcarp\xe2\x80\x99s natural habitat need to be tackled if its future is to be secured (1). ,loss;invasive;pet; ,captive breeding; ,3,1

Today habitat loss remains the greatest threat primarily due to human population growth and immigration in the region which has led to an increase in logging and agriculture particularly coffee plantations. Such habitat alteration reduces the number of nesting areas and the supply of food for the speckle-chested piculet considerably disrupting its activity and ability to reproduce. These threats are most prominent in the south-eastern parts of the speckle-chested piculet\xe2\x80\x99s range where forest is now restricted to only the highest slopes (2).\xa0,While in most areas forest clearance continues unabated the speckle-chested piculet\xe2\x80\x99s habitat is protected within the Alto Mayo Protected Forest an area which has been protected since 1986 (2). ,loss; ,protected; ,1,1
Animalia,Gazella spekei,Spekeâs gazelle (Gazella spekei),Animalia,Chordata,Mammalia,Cetartiodactyla,Bovidae,Gazella (1),15 â 25 kg (2),Uncontrolled hunting for its meat competition with domestic livestock for grazing degradation of its habitat and drought are all serious ongoing problems for the survival of Speke\xe2\x80\x99s gazelle (1) (5). Unfortunately Somalia\xe2\x80\x99s unstable political climate over the last 20 years has meant that there has been no centralised government to implement any protective measures for this species (1). More recently an illegal wildlife trade which includes antelopes has developed yet another threat to a species whose survival is already at risk (1).,It was predicted in 1998 that in the absence of protective measures Speke\xe2\x80\x99s gazelle would decline in conservation status from Vulnerable to Endangered (5). The fact that this change in conservation status has occurred highlights the uncertain future of this species in the wild. The total population of Speke\xe2\x80\x99s gazelle declined by 50 percent in the period 1988 to 2006 and there are still no schemes in place to protect this animal or its habitat within its current range (1). There are however a number of populations being successfully bred in captivity which will at least serve to protect this unique animal from total extinction and offer a hope for the reintroduction of populations to the wild (1) (4). ,hunting;pet; , ,2,0

Indeed much of the forest understorey has been cleared for planting cardamom in the Knuckles Mountains where this lizard is found although the canopy has been retained for shade (4). The Agra-Bopath area of this species\xe2\x80\x99 range is becoming increasingly isolated by surrounding vegetable cultivations and tea plantations with the lack of clearly demarcated boundaries leading to significant encroachment into this forest (4) (5). Isolation of populations prevents both important genetic flow between subpopulations and means of escape from forest fires (4) (7). Further more there is intensive use of pesticides on vegetable cultivations and tea plantations in Sri Lanka which could be having a serious polluting affect. Although the impact these chemicals are having on non-target species is not yet known studies elsewhere indicate that they could potentially be devastating (4) with possibilities for <strong>bioaccumulation</strong> (5). Climatic change and global warming may also be having a negative impact on the species as a result of forest diebacks due to acid rain (5). Domestic animals in the Knuckles Mountains such as cats dogs and poultry also prey on reptiles (7) although the <strong>arboreal</strong> nature of the spineless forest lizard probably limits this threat.,Project Knuckles 2004 was initiated to conduct the first in-depth study of reptiles and the primary threats facing them in the Knuckles Mountain Range (7). It was discovered that the region held some of the highest reptile diversity in the country and is therefore an important site for conservation (9). The spineless forest lizard was one of three target species studied (9). The mountain range currently has little protected status or conservation management but the discovery of many endemic and endangered reptiles in the area may help campaigns to achieve greater protection in the future (4). ,fragmentation; ,protected; ,1,1

As the spiny angel shark is a bottom dweller it is especially prone to being caught by gillnets and bottom trawling (1).,Brazil currently has no measures in place to control the angel shark fishery although trawling inshore waters is prohibited. Argentina has established a Maximum Permitted Catch of the spiny angel shark to limit the number of spiny angel sharks caught by fisheries (1). ,fishing;overfishing; , ,2,0
Animalia,Io fluvialis,Spiny river snail (Io fluvialis),Animalia,Mollusca,Gastropoda,Sorbeoconcha,Pleuroceridae,Io (1),Length: up to 5 cm (2),The main reason for the decline in the spiny river snail\xe2\x80\x99s population is the reduction in water quality from industrial and agricultural pollution. Dam construction has also caused further degradation of the habitat in which the spiny river snail lives. The dams effectively turn the river into a reservoir eliminating current flow and increasing water depth thus altering the habitat for the spiny river snail to such an extent that the snail is unable to tolerate the changed environment (4).,Conservation and recovery efforts for this freshwater snail include artificial culture water pollution control and most importantly habitat protection and restoration (4). ,environment;pollution; , ,2,0
cog-wheel turtle; Spiny hill turtle; spiny terrapin; sunburst turtle,Heosemys spinosa,Spiny turtle (Heosemys spinosa),Animalia,Chordata,Reptilia,Testudines,Bataguridae,Heosemys (1),1.5 â 2 kg (2),Like most Asian turtle species the spiny turtle is in grave danger of extinction due to over-collection from the wild for the Asian food market and international pet trade as well as being threatened by the destruction of its habitat (11). Wild populations are thought to be plummeting particularly in Indonesia where they are considered Critically Endangered and known trade volumes have recently declined by about 50 %. Elsewhere the species is restricted to small and isolated populations over much of its range (1). When they reach the West and enter the pet market imported Asian turtles are often parasite ridden and mortality is relatively high (4) (8). Many have also had to endure poor and incredibly stressful conditions in food markets and are dehydrated and malnourished from their long journeys from the Asian food markets to the Western pet trade (8). Unfortunately the extreme difficulty in breeding this species in captivity means that all specimens found in pet stores today are still caught from the wild and freshly imported from Asia.,Like many other species the spiny turtle would benefit from captive breeding programmes or \xe2\x80\x98turtle farms\xe2\x80\x99 to supply the food and pet market and thereby mitigate the demand to remove large numbers from the wild (4). Unfortunately this species is notoriously difficult to breed in captivity and only a handful of institutions have ever successfully bred the species including Zoo Atlanta and Knoxville Zoo in the US. and Durell Wildlife in Jersey Europe (9) (11). Nevertheless these few successes provide fresh hope that a captive breeding programme might one day be able to haul the species back from the brink of extinction (12). It is also hoped that these successful reproductive attempts will help provide more information about the biology and ecology of this beautiful yet complex species information that can prove invaluable for conservation action in the wild (11) (12). ,pet; ,captive breeding; ,1,1

Fischerâs ground-thrush,Zoothera guttata,Spotted ground-thrush (Zoothera guttata),Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Turdidae,Zoothera (1),45 - 78 g (2),The destruction of spotted ground-thrush habitat has meant that the small and severely fragmented populations are in decline (4).  Bush fires deforestation and the spread of exotic species have continued to decrease the amount of suitable habitat (6).  In South Africa the wintering habitat has been destroyed by mining and in the coastal forests of Tanzania which are used as \xe2\x80\x98stepping stones\xe2\x80\x99 in migration charcoal production has degraded habitat (6).  Despite habitat loss being the primary threat to the spotted ground-thrush its recovery is also limited by its own poor breeding success (6).,The spotted ground-thrush is protected by its listing on Appendix II of the Convention on Migratory Species (CMS) (3).  An International Action Plan for the spotted ground-thrush was produced by BirdLife International with a five year plan set out.  It is hoped the plan due to end in 2010 will improve knowledge on the species\xe2\x80\x99 habitat requirements breeding success and migration routes so that the population can be stabilised (4) (6). ,loss; ,protected; ,1,1

Animalia,Clemmys guttata,Spotted turtle (Clemmys guttata),Animalia,Chordata,Reptilia,Testudines,Emydidae,Clemmys (1),Maximum length: 13.6 cm (2) (3),Spotted turtle numbers are declining due to unsustainable collection for the pet trade habitat destruction and fragmentation road mortality agriculture and pollution (2) (12). The drainage of wetlands deepening of marsh habitats in favour of waterfowl populations and the conversion of wetlands into agricultural and residential land has resulted in the loss fragmentation and modification of the spotted turtle\xe2\x80\x99s habitat. This has left remaining spotted turtles living in very small isolated subpopulations which are more vulnerable to the effects of <strong>inbreeding</strong> over-collection for the pet trade and predation (7) (11). In addition road related mortality is thought to be a significant factor for nests and hatchlings as well as female adults as they travel over land to nest (4) (6). In Ontario pollution of aquatic habitats by substances such as DDT and PCB\xe2\x80\x99s is also thought to be a problem for some spotted turtle populations (6). Predators such as raccoons dogs snapping turtles skunks foxes and other small mammals are responsible for the low recruitment of juveniles preying most heavily on eggs and hatchlings but occasionally also on adults (4) (6). Unfortunately the spotted turtle\xe2\x80\x99s life history traits namely high egg (and probably hatchling) mortality low reproductive potential in the wild delayed sexual maturity (7 to 14 years) balanced by a long potential adult breeding life deem it highly vulnerable to population collapses when faced with these threats (2) (10). If adult survivorship is reduced through factors such as human exploitation road mortality or increased predator levels populations are inevitably unable to produce and successfully raise enough offspring to recover depleted numbers leading eventually to local extinctions (2) (11).,Spotted turtles are legally protected to some degree from exploitation in most states and provinces in which they are found but protection is not yet consistent or universal over the turtle's range (2) (5). In Canada the spotted turtle is listed as Endangered by the Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada (COSEWIC) (2004) and is listed as a Specially Protected Reptile (Schedule 9) in the Fish and Wildlife Conservation Act (1997). In the U.S. the spotted turtle is not currently listed in the US Federal Endangered Species Act; however it is listed in 22 of the states in which it occurs (2). Furthermore there is insufficient protection of its wetland habitat a matter which needs addressing if the species is to be given a good chance of long-term survival (4). ,loss;fragmentation;pet;pollution; ,protected;endangered species act; ,4,2

Ceylon whistling thrush,Myophonus blighi,Sri Lanka whistling thrush (Myophonus blighi),Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Turdidae,Myophonus (1),Size: 19 â 21.5 cm (2),The main threat to the Sri Lanka whistling thrush is the clearance of its upland forest habitat which has left this rare species with a very small severely fragmented population and range that are undergoing continuing declines. Montane forests have been extensively cleared for conversion to timber plantations and agriculture firewood collection particularly around Nuwara Eliya Maskeliya and Bogowantaalaw and gem mining. Even some \xe2\x80\x98protected forests\xe2\x80\x99 are unable to escape these threats and continue to be degraded and fragmented. In particular the replacement of natural mixed forests containing fruiting trees with single-species plantations has badly affected this bird by reducing its available food supply. In addition streams within this species\xe2\x80\x99 range are becoming polluted with run-off chemicals such as insecticides and pesticides from nearby vegetable farms almost certainly harming stream-dependent birds such as the Sri Lanka Whistling-thrush. It has also been speculated that mountain forest die-back may be the result of acid clouds rain and mist caused by air-pollution (3) (4).,The Sri Lanka whistling thrush is legally protected in Sri Lanka and occurs in several national parks and forest reserves most notably Peak Wilderness Sanctuary and Hakgala Strict Nature Reserve (3) (4). A moratorium was also passed in 1990 to protect wet zone forests from logging (3). ,pollution; ,protected; ,1,1
Plantae,Commidendrum robustum,St Helena gumwood (Commidendrum robustum),Plantae,Tracheophyta,Magnoliopsida,Asterales,Compositae,Commidendrum (1),Height: 5 â 8 m (2),St Helena was settled in 1659 and since then the St Helena gumwood has been exploited for use as timber and firewood. Forests were cleared for use as pastureland and introduced goats grazed heavily on seedlings. Populations were reduced to extremely low numbers by the 1980s at which point a conservation management plan was started. In 1991 the largest population at Peak Dale was attacked by the jacaranda bug <i>Orthezia insignis</i>. This sucking insect took sap from the trees and encouraged a black mould that rapidly killed infected trees (2).,Protected by the Endangered Endemic and Indigenous Species Protection Ordinance 7 of 1996 the St Helena gumwood has been the focus of a conservation programme started in the 1980s. An extremely successful biological control programme to combat the jacaranda bug involved the introduction of the ladybird <i>Hyperaspis pantherina</i> from Kenya (2). Following dangerous reductions in populations of the St Helena gumwood the Millennium Gumwood Forest Project was started and resulted in the planting of 4300 trees in a previously degraded wasteland in 2000 (2). Other replanting projects are underway as well as weed clearances (3). Although it is not thought that any pure trees of the <strong>subspecies</strong> <i>Commidendrum robustum gummiferum</i> exist the <strong>hybrid</strong> population at Peak Dale shows some characteristics of this <strong>subspecies</strong> (4). , ,protected; ,0,1

Some land has been purchased by Riverside County in California to create reserves (1) and dispersal corridors have been established to link separate habitat areas (3) (6).

Excessive harvesting of fruit is just one explanation along with increased predation by burgeoning wild pig and rat populations and the absence of seed dispersal agents for the lack of regeneration at all but one locality (2) (5). Unfortunately all the localities where the Suarez baobab is found are being rapidly degraded by deforestation for timber firewood and charcoal including the only remaining regenerating population which is under increasing threat from a growing mining town (5).,Despite being one of the most endangered of Madagascan baobabs the Suarez baobab is the only species that is not protected within a reserve (5). In recent years the Madagascan government has pledged to triple the size of protected areas within the country including increasing the amount of forest under protection by five million hectares (6).

Consequently the sun parakeet is now rare or absent in much of its former range with an estimated 1000 to 2500 wild birds remaining (5).\xa0Guyana removed an annual quota of 600 birds from the wild in the 1980s while around 2200 birds were exported to the United States alone between 1981 and 1985 (2) (5).\xa0The trade in parrots is notoriously popular in Brazilian markets and although the number of traded wild sun parakeets is unknown it is likely to be very high (7).\xa0Birds are easily captured using seed bait and whole flocks can be extirpated from an area very easily.\xa0The sun parakeet is also threatened by habitat conversion for agriculture and live stock overgrazing but the severity of these threats have not yet been evaluated (5).,The sun parakeet is currently listed on Appendix II of CITES meaning international trade must be regulated and requires export permits (3).\xa0However it has been proposed that the species is upgraded to Appendix I due to the severe detrimental impact of trade on wild populations (5).\xa0This would result in the prohibition of international trade in the species excluding exceptional circumstances such as scientific research (3).\xa0Further proposed conservation measures include working with the indigenous inhabitants of the Terra Indigena Raposa Serra do Sol and the Amerindian community in Karasabai village to prevent the trapping of wild birds and to protect sun parakeet habitat.\xa0Further surveys are also required to identify the full extent of the species\xe2\x80\x99 range and to evaluate the impact of habitat loss and conversion (5). ,pet; ,cites; ,1,1

Periquito Migrador,Lathamus discolor,Swift parrot (Lathamus discolor),Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Psittaciformes,Psittacidae,Lathamus (1),Size: 25 cm (2),In Tasmania the swift parrot\xe2\x80\x99s breeding pattern is determined by the flowering of various eucalypt trees (6). However the clearing of these trees for agriculture residential development plantation timber sawlog production and clear-felling for woodchips has reduced this parrot\xe2\x80\x99s breeding habitat by 44% (2) (5). Of the remaining forested habitat only 5% contains potentially suitable foraging habitat for this species (5). In addition swift parrots suffer high mortality through collision with windows vehicles and fences. The total swift parrot population is estimated to be no more than 1000 pairs. At best it is stable but given the current mortality rates and habitat destruction it is more likely to be declining (5).,As this species is such as specialist in both its winter habitat and foraging requirements the survival of the swift parrot will depend on the protection of remaining areas of eucalypt species and the protection of all breeding and foraging sites in Tasmania (6). The Swift Parrot Recovery Plan 2001 - 2005 is addressing these priorities and is planning to reduce this species\xe2\x80\x99 conservation status from endangered to vulnerable within the next 10 years (5). , , ,0,0

At present it is estimated that there are only a few hundred individuals remaining and these are threatened by habitat alteration and disturbance as a result of an invasive weed bamboo harvesting road and dam construction and four-wheel drive vehicles (2). It is very likely that the Tahiti reed-warbler is also affected by introduced species such as the black rat and the common myna which may compete for nesting sites (2).,Luckily despite this bird\xe2\x80\x99s rarity and possible threats numbers of the Tahiti reed-warbler are thought to be stable. However it is important that surveys are undertaken to determine whether this is correct and also to monitor the effect that introduced species and habitat degradation has on this rare song-bird (4). ,invasive;pet; , ,2,0

When 'rediscovered' in 1948 just 250 to 300 takahe survived and the population has undergone further declines since that time (3). Habitat modification and the introduction of predators such as dogs to lowland habitats were significant in the decline of takahe numbers although these birds were probably never particularly numerous (6). More recently harsh winters (3) and competition for grass tussocks with introduced red deer (<em>Cervus elaphus</em>) (6) have caused great fluctuations in the precarious populations that remain; predation by the introduced stoat (<em>Mustela erminea</em>) may also have taken its toll (3).,After the species was rediscovered a special area was set up within Fiordland National Park in order to conserve this rare bird. Deer have been controlled in the area and the habitat has started to show signs of recovery although takahe numbers remain low (7). The New Zealand Department of Conservation's Takahe Recovery Plan began to introduce pairs to predator-free islands in 1985 (4) (7). These birds have been extensively managed and measures such as supplementary feeding and captive breeding have helped to produce successful populations (3). The Recovery Plan is currently being revised but the long-term aim is to produce two self-sustaining populations containing 100 pairs each; one in Fiordland and one on the offshore islands and other lowland habitats (6). Takahe numbers reached a low of just 118 birds in 1982 but thanks to concerted conservation efforts the population now stands at 242 individuals (6). ,pet; ,captive breeding; ,1,1

This species occurs in the Karakelang Wildlife Reserve but there is currently little effort to manage this site. A four-year project by the Global Environment Facility (GEF) is underway to introduce measures of protection.

Without urgent action there is a high probability of this mangabey becoming extinct over the next 50 - 100 years (11). In 1994 it was estimated that just 1000 to 1200 individuals remained (1). The population is possibly much lower today since their habitat has been severely degraded since then with an approximate 30 % loss of original vegetation (10) (12). In addition local communities continue to degrade the remaining forest for products used in the construction of homes and canoes the collection of wild honey and the topping of date palms to make palm wine (12). As the average number of mangabey groups has been found to correlate with forest area and density of trees the loss and degradation of forest is a major cause for concern. Mangabey-human conflict has also increased in recent years due to crop-raiding resulting in traps being set (1).,The Tana River National Primate Reserve was established in 1976 to preserve the endemic and endangered Tana River mangabey and Tana River red colobus (<i>Colobus rufomitratus</i>) (13) but only covers part of the mangabey\xe2\x80\x99s range. A 5-year project with the World Bank and Global Environment Facility (GEF) was also started in 1996. Originally designed to relocate several hundred families that presently live within the reserve financial support was ultimately withdrawn before completion of the project (12). Sadly forests continue to decline and a new conservation approach is desperately needed to protect them where past approaches have failed. Their failure was largely due to disregard of land-tenure issues within the Reserve exclusion of local people from decision-making and neglect of forests outside the reserve (10). Solutions must be found for the problem of forest clearing and the harvesting of forest products must be better managed if there is any chance of protecting the habitat of this critically endangered primate and evading its otherwise imminent extinction. ,loss; , ,1,0

As a consequence this iconic species was persecuted for many years through trapping and poisoning (1) (3). In the face of persecution deforestation and a severe epidemic in the early 20<sup>th</sup>century the Tasmanian devil became extremely rare until a protective law was passed in 1941 that saw its numbers gradually rise again (3). Although systematic poisoning resumed with questionable merit in the 1980s and 1990s by this stage the population had recovered sufficiently for the species to be abundant in many parts of Tasmania (2). Then in the mid 1990s disaster struck when a number of Tasmanian devils were sighted with strange facial tumours later discovered to be a fatal cancer now commonly known as Devil Facial Tumour Disease (DFTD) (3) (4) (5).\xa0,In the absence of drastic conservation measures the Tasmanian devil is projected to be extinct in the wild within 25 years (3). Fortunately considerable effort is being made at the local national and international level to prevent the realisation of this dire forecast. In May 2009 Australia\xe2\x80\x99s Federal Government uplisted the Tasmanian devil to the \xe2\x80\x98Endangered\xe2\x80\x99 category under the Commonwealth\xe2\x80\x99s Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 which will ensure the species receives greater protection under national environmental laws (3) (4). At the forefront of conservation efforts is the Save the Tasmanian Devil Program launched in 2003 and co-ordinated by the Tasmanian Government\xe2\x80\x99s Department of Primary Industries and Water (1) (3) (4). The focus of the program is: to continue to monitor the impact of DFTD on the Tasmanian devil population; to further investigate the disease including its transmission and causes; to develop methods of managing the impact of the disease; and to maintain an insurance population recruited from disease free areas. Should the need arise this captive bred insurance population could prove critical to establishing a healthy wild population in the wake of DFTDs devastating impact (3) (4). ,loss;disease;pet; , ,3,0

The main threats to the species are habitat loss and hunting with grasslands converted to agriculture pasture or settlement or degraded by human-induced fires and introduced grasses and with hares shot for sport\xa0(1)\xa0(2)\xa0(5)\xa0(7). The species is also hunted for food and conservation laws are not being enforced\xa0(6). Low genetic variation in the tiny remaining population may pose an additional threat\xa0(1) potentially leading to <strong>inbreeding</strong>.,The Tehuantepec jackrabbit is listed as Critically Endangered by the Mexican government\xa0(1) (13) but conservation laws are not well enforced by local authorities\xa0(1) and the areas the species inhabits are unprotected\xa0(10). Effective protection of the species\xe2\x80\x99 habitat is urgently needed together with the preservation of its natural structure and diversity\xa0(4)\xa0(10). Other recommended conservation actions for the Tehuantepec jackrabbit include better regulation of hunting further research into the species captive breeding education programmes\xa0(2) and further surveys to clarify the extent of its distribution (14).

Much of Sri Lanka\xe2\x80\x99s original tropical moist montane forest has been cleared during the last two centuries for cinchona coffee tea rubber and cardamom plantations for grazing livestock by logging companies illegal logging and removal of timber by peripheral villagers (5) (8). The montane forests of the Knuckles Mountains where this species is found have been particularly affected by cardamom cultivation which requires that much of the forest understorey is cleared and although the canopy is retained for shade continuing weeding of the area to remove competing vegetation prevents natural regeneration of the forest. Some areas are also still cultivated for vegetables using traditional slash and burn techniques and on occasion this can lead to out-of-control forest fires (6). With a rapidly growing population and increasing demand for agricultural land the destruction of montane forests continues at an alarming rate. Further more there is intensive use of pesticides on vegetable cultivations and tea plantations in Sri Lanka which could be having a serious polluting affect. Although the impact these chemicals are having on non-target species is not yet known studies elsewhere indicate that they could potentially be devastating with possibilities for <strong>bioaccumulation</strong>. There is also evidence in the tropical moist montane forests of the Knuckles Mountains of large-scale forest die-back thought to be the result of acid rain and these forests are considered particularly at risk from climate change especially global warming (5).,Project Knuckles 2004 and a follow-up expedition in 2005 were initiated to conduct the first in-depth study of reptiles and the primary threats facing them in the Knuckles Mountain Range (6). It was discovered that the region held some of the highest reptile diversity in the country and is therefore an important site for conservation. Tennent\xe2\x80\x99s leaf-nosed lizard was one of three target species studied (9). As of 2000 areas above 1067 m above sea level were given protected status as conservation forest. As such cardamom cultivation has had to be abandoned in the area. However rather than allowing the natural regeneration of native forest the cardamom appears to have been replaced by a series of invasive weeds such as mistflower (<i>Eupatorium riparium</i>) and Lantana (<i>Lantana camara</i>) (6). Fortunately Tennent\xe2\x80\x99s leaf-nosed lizards appear to be fairly adaptable and tolerant of some degree of habitat disturbance having been recorded from forests under planted with cardamom and pine plantations providing hope for the long-term survival of this unique unusual looking reptile (3) (6). ,loss;fragmentation;pet; ,protected; ,3,1

It is also protected by wildlife laws in Bangladesh India Pakistan and Sri Lanka (1) although as hunting remains the primary threat to this species it is clear that such laws are not enforced as strongly as they need to be.

Plantae,Thuja sutchuenensis,Thuja (Thuja sutchuenensis),Plantae,Tracheophyta,Coniferopsida,Coniferales,Cupressaceae,Thuja (1),Height: up to 20 m (2),The wood of <em>T. sutchuenensis </em>is soft light and easily worked as well as being fragrant and rot-resistant and therefore is often used by local people in construction and craftwork. Consequently many of the most accessible trees have already been cut down leaving only the smaller shrub-like trees growing in remote locations at higher altitudes\xa0(1)\xa0(2). With its small population size estimated at just 200 trees\xa0(4) it is probable that the species has gone through a genetic bottleneck and thus <strong>inbreeding</strong> amongst the remaining individuals may be a serious problem. In addition seedlings are scarce and plant diseases caused by micro-organisms have been observed but the extent of their impact is not yet known\xa0(1)\xa0(2).,As the only member of its genus distributed in central China <em>T. sutchuenensis</em> is of great scientific value in studies of the origin and evolution of the flora of central China\xa0(2). The conservation of this rare tree is thus considered a high priority. The Global Trees Campaign is working with two Chinese institutions to ensure the long-term conservation of <em>T. sutchuenensis</em>. The aims of the project are to conduct further surveys of potential habitat; to study the remaining population to identify the causes of the species\xe2\x80\x99 poor regeneration; and the <strong>ex-situ</strong> propagation of seedlings in nurseries which will provide plants for potential re-planting in the wild (4). ,disease; , ,1,0
Cholo alethe,Alethe choloensis,Thyolo alethe (Alethe choloensis),Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Turdidae,Alethe (1),41 g (2),The small areas of forest inhabited by the Thyolo alethe are being impacted by a number of human activities leaving this bird in a precarious situation.  Deforestation fires and clearance for cultivation have all taken their toll on this bird\xe2\x80\x99s habitat; between the 1970s and 1990s at least three of the forest patches in which the Thyolo alethe occurred were completely cleared (3).,Several areas in Malawi in which the Thyolo alethe occurs are considered Forest Reserves but as the clearance of the Thyolo Forest Reserve demonstrates this title often provides little protection in reality (3). One area in which this may not be true is the Mulanje Mountain Forest Reserve.  This reserve the stronghold of the population in Malawi is the focus of a programme that provides long-term support for research and conservation measures (3) (5).  The declining forest of Mount Namuli is currently unprotected although in 2008 efforts were underway to protect some of this habitat (3).  It is clear that the focus of conservation measures for this Endangered bird should be the preservation of the remaining fragments of evergreen forest.  The development of alternate fuel sources and improved agricultural practices are just two of the ways in which this could be achieved (3). , ,protected; ,0,1

As an island <strong>endemic</strong> with a restricted range of just three small islands and a population thought to number only 2000 individuals the tiger chameleon is particularly vulnerable to changes within its habitat (7).,The tiger chameleon and its habitat are protected within the Morne Seychelles (Mah\xc3\xa9) and Praslin National Parks (3) and alien plant control on Praslin (7) and habitat restoration programmes on Silhouette are being undertaken to help this species (8). The main population occurs on Silhouette where it has been suggested that forested areas containing populations should be given legal protection by being included in a new protected area (3). , ,protected; ,0,1

Habitat destruction poses no threat as the Wet Tropics Heritage Area of Queensland that the torrent tree frog inhabits has been protected and undisturbed since 1988 (1) (7). The effects of drought floods and pollution have also been ruled out as contributors to the decline (1).,A recovery plan for this species has been developed (10). As the cause of its decline is uncertain the recovery plan focuses on protection of remaining populations and their habitat population monitoring and research into its ecology and the disease. Indeed unless the determinants of this decline are accurately identified and appropriately dealt with the future of this species cannot be safeguarded. ,disease;pollution; , ,2,0

In particular introduced predators such as the rainbow trout (<em>Oncorhynchus mykiss</em>) and small mouth bass (<em>Microterus dolomieu</em>) have had a major impact on this species when they were introduced to the Treur River (1) (3).,In 1970 the only area in which the Treur River barb occured Bendigospruit was declared an International Biological Program\xa0(IBP) conservation site. This status restricted practices such as the introduction of new fish or bird species to the area and this has reduced disturbances to the stream and therefore to the Treur River barb (5). The land owners of the site also have their own conservation plan which includes clearing invasive plant species near the river bank (3). , , ,0,0

Animalia,Agelaius tricolor,Tricoloured blackbird (Agelaius tricolor),Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Icteridae,Agelaius (1),Length: 18 â 24 cm (2),Historically the tricoloured blackbird\xe2\x80\x99s population underwent a serious decline primarily due to habitat loss as a result of urbanisation conversion of land for agriculture and the draining of wetlands. In addition hunting of this species for sale at markets and deliberate poisoning to safeguard crops were both extensively practiced up until their ban in 1970s and 1980s (4). Despite losing a great deal of its native habitat the tricoloured blackbird has adapted and today large numbers breed in silage and in upland regions (3). Unfortunately in these environments this species faces new threats as many colonies are being decimated by herbicide poisoning predation and in particular silage harvesting. The silage harvest takes place while the tricoloured blackbird is laying eggs and brooding chicks and may therefore destroy an entire colony\xe2\x80\x99s breeding efforts. With some silage colonies comprising tens of thousands of birds these losses represent a significant portion of this species\xe2\x80\x99 global population (3) (4).,Efforts to conserve the tricoloured blackbird have been made by the US Fish and Wildlife Service by either purchasing whole areas of silage from private landowners or by paying them to delay the silage harvest long enough to allow the tricoloured blackbird to successfully breed (4). While this has been extremely beneficial for the survival of tricoloured blackbird colonies the US Fish and Wildlife Service do not consider it to be a long-term solution for the management of this species. Other proposed measures to conserve this species include delaying herbicide application until the tricoloured blackbird has completed its breeding cycle and the creation of areas of marshland and blackberries within key silage nesting regions offering a safe alternative breeding habitat (2). ,loss;hunting;environment; ,endangered species act; ,3,1

The threats to the survival of this bird are mounting as its island environment becomes increasingly colonised encroached upon and disturbed by humans who destroy habitat for settlements and coconut plantations. The introduction of predators such as cats and rats particularly the black rat (<i>Rattus rattus</i>) is another serious concern and has probably eliminated the species from all but the most infrequently visited islands. As a result this formerly widespread bird is now restricted to just a few known locations that are typically predator-free uninhabited islands (3). An additional concern has been expressed about the impacts of climate change and sea-level rises which have the potential to flood and submerge the small islands on which this endangered species lives (5).,Research expeditions in 1999 2001 and 2003 have helped collect and collate valuable information on the Tuamotu sandpiper and its distribution but further surveys are still desperately needed (3) (6). Further conservation measures advocated include identifying suitable islands for translocation either rat and cat-free or where eradication is possible and developing a recovery plan for the species (3). If measures such as these are not undertaken soon this bird may fall victim to the ever growing extinction crisis that currently threatens our planet (2). ,loss;environment; , ,2,0

Kakamega and South Nandi Forests in Kenya are threatened by the encroachment of agriculture (both cultivation and cattle-grazing) uncontrolled logging and charcoal-making (3). South Nandi Forest in particular is being impacted by commercial logging; not only is it undertaken in a destructive manner but it is targeting <i>Croton megalocarpus</i> a preferred tree of the Turner\xe2\x80\x99s eremomela (3). In the Democratic Republic of Congo and Uganda the Turner\xe2\x80\x99s eremomela is considered rare but little else is known about its status (2).,The northern part of Kakamega Forest has been declared a national park and another small area of the forest has been set aside as a national reserve (2) measures which will offer some protection to the habitat of the Turner\xe2\x80\x99s eremomela\xe2\x80\x99s. A group of local guides in Kakamega Forest have also initiated a programme of environmental education and awareness activities. However effective conservation of both Kakamega and South Nandi Forests are still lacking and commercial logging continues despite a ban on the logging of indigenous trees in Kenya (3). Major conservation projects are required to ensure the protection of these forests in Kenya including enforcing the ban on logging indigenous trees which will help secure the eremomela\xe2\x80\x99s future (3). , , ,0,0

The introduction of the black rat (<i>Rattus rattus</i>) by sea vessels to Nuku Hiva around 1915 Ua Pou around 1980 and Fatu Hiva in 2000 (2) contributed to the swift extinction of each island\xe2\x80\x99s ultramarine lorikeet population. The <strong>arboreal</strong> rats inhabit hollows in trees and are easily able to access this species\xe2\x80\x99 nests and consume its eggs (4).,There have been several conservation initiatives proposed and implemented for this species. In the 1990s a small number of ultramarine lorikeets were <strong>translocated</strong> to Fatu Hiva where until the black rat\xe2\x80\x99s introduction in 2000 they had formed a successful growing population. Sadly measures to protect this species from the rats proved unsuccessful and by 2007 Fatu Hiva\xe2\x80\x99s ultramarine lorikeet population was considered extinct. Nevertheless a similar <strong>translocation</strong> initiative has been proposed this time to transfer individuals to the nearby island of Mohotani but only if the island\xe2\x80\x99s cat population can be eradicated (2). , , ,0,0

Animalia,Cynomys parvidens,Utah prairie dog (Cynomys parvidens),Animalia,Chordata,Mammalia,Rodentia,Sciuridae,Cynomys (1),Total length: 30 - 36 cm (2) (3)Tail length: 3 - 6.5 cm (2) (3)Male weight: 355 - 1635 g (2) (3) (4)Female weight: 327 - 1123 g (2) (3) (4),The main threat to the Utah prairie dog is a common one: the invasion of its habitat by humans. Ranchers clearing land for grazing view the Utah prairie dog as a pest which spreads disease and consumes vegetation that their cattle would otherwise eat and so commonly use poisonous bait scattered near burrow-entrances or poisonous gases injected into burrows to eliminate the prairie dog (1) (3) (11). Another threat is sylvatic (bubonic) plague which is caused by a bacterium (<em>Yersinia pestis</em>) and is transmitted by fleas. Plague is an introduced disease to which the Utah prairie dog has not had time to evolve a good defence (11).\xa0 Because of these threats Utah prairie dogs currently inhabit only about 5 percent of the area that they occupied 200 years ago (11).\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0,By 1991 populations of the Utah prairie dog had declined so steeply that the United States Fish and Wildlife Service classified it as an \xe2\x80\x98Endangered\xe2\x80\x99 species making it illegal to kill and a formal recovery plan was established. The plan involved moving prairie dog populations from private to public land thereby removing the temptation for farmers and ranchers to poison or shoot them. As a result of the success of this the classification was changed from \xe2\x80\x98Endangered\xe2\x80\x99 to \xe2\x80\x98Threatened\xe2\x80\x99 but as this allows this rare species to be hunted once again several petitioners want the status changed back to \xe2\x80\x98Endangered\xe2\x80\x99 (1) (11).\xa0 ,disease; , ,1,0

Farming of crops such as coffee mangos bananas and other tropical fruit has caused large-scale deforestation and degradation of the Venezuelan sylph\xe2\x80\x99s forest habitat. The increase in cash-crop agriculture a form of cultivation which produces crops for rapid growth and quick sale has resulted in uncontrolled burning of forests which also destroys or degrades the Venezuelan sylph\xe2\x80\x99s habitat. A potential risk of further habitat degradation also exists should development plans for road construction and gas pipelines in many areas of Venezuelan forest go ahead (2).,Protection of the Venezuelan sylph\xe2\x80\x99s habitat is essential to the long term survival of this species (2). It is possible that it occurs in the Peninsula de Paria National Park (6) which may afford it some protection (2). Further research is required to confirm the Venezuelan sylph\xe2\x80\x99s presence in the park and if populations are found careful monitoring should be carried out to assess the status of the population. Furthermore populations of the Venezuelan sylph should be studied throughout its fragmented range to identify the trends population sizes and additional threats to this species\xe2\x80\x99 survival (2). ,loss;fragmentation; , ,2,0

In 2003 it was estimated that only nine percent of the vernal pool habitat in California\xe2\x80\x99s Central Valley remained (2).,In 1994 the U.S Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) gave the vernal pool tadpole shrimp protection as an Endangered species (5).

This is decreasing further due to destruction of the pheasant\xe2\x80\x99s specialised lowland forest habitat and high levels of hunting (6).,The successful conservation of the Vietnamese pheasant will depend on its effective protection achievable through reserves. Within these reserves all forest clearance fragrant oil production rattan and palm leaf collection should be prohibited. Surveys between 1988 and 1994 contributed to the drawing up of a management plan for the Ke Go Nature Reserve which was published in 1996. Since this management plan came into effect timber extraction has now ceased within the reserve which is considered to be a vitally important site for the long-term conservation of many East Asian fowl (6). ,hunting; ,captive breeding; ,1,1

Animalia,Limoniscus violaceus,Violet click beetle (Limoniscus violaceus),Animalia,Arthropoda,Insecta,Coleoptera,Elateridae,Limoniscus,Length: 12 mm (adult),The violet click\xa0beetle has always been rare in the UK in historic times and has not been found in the <strong>sub-fossil</strong> record to date. This suggests it has been rare for a very long time. However the particular conditions the beetle requires are hardly ever found and the felling of old trees for safety reasons means that its habitats are becoming even rarer.,Efforts in the UK have concentrated on providing more sites for the violet click\xa0beetle. There are few suitable trees on the British sites at Bredon Hill and Windsor. Some trees were found to contain <strong>larvae</strong> but none of the others seemed likely to provide the right conditions. Following the great storm of 1987 one old hollow beech in Windsor Forest blew down. Ted Green the (then) warden managed to re-erect it by using another living tree as support and then began to experiment with various 'rotting' ingredients to attempt to create the conditions needed by the violet click beetle. After seven years Ted's efforts bore fruit and five <strong>larvae</strong> were found inside his prepared tree. Plans are well under way to erect and prepare more suitable trees and even artificially 'age' some. This is taking place with the help of dead wood <strong>invertebrate</strong> and <strong>fungus</strong> specialists as part of English Nature's Species Recovery Programme. , , ,0,0

Habitat degradation and conversion to developments for tourism human settlements and road construction are particularly severe problems while predation from introduced mammals such as rats and mongoose also threatens many native species (6). As a result of these threats the range of the Virgin Islands coqui has become highly fragmented and there is an ongoing decline in the quality of its habitat. The small distinct population on Great Dog is particularly vulnerable. The Virgin Islands coqui also appears to be declining with the spread of the predatory Cuban tree frog (<em>Osteopilus septentrionalis</em>) (1).<em>\xa0 </em>,A number of conservation recommendations have been made to protect the native fauna of the British Virgin Islands including the creation of protected areas and minimising the impacts of development through the better enforcement of protective legislation. Increased monitoring efforts for amphibian populations may also be required given the potential for deadly diseases such as the fungus chytridiomycosis to break out on the island especially as disease has been associated with dramatic amphibian declines on nearby islands (6). Additional study and protection of the Virgin Islands coqui population on Great Dog is a conservation priority for the species while there is also a need to afford its habitat on Tortola and Virgin Gorda increased protection and control invasive predators (1) (6). , ,protected; ,0,1

Philippine spotted deer,Rusa alfredi,Visayan spotted deer (Rusa alfredi),Animalia,Chordata,Mammalia,Cetartiodactyla,Cervidae,Rusa (1),40 - 60 kg (2),The Visayan spotted deer is one of the rarest and most narrowly distributed mammals in the world with only a few hundred wild animals thought to remain (3). Indeed a survey in 1991 found that the species had already become extinct in over 95 percent of its former range largely as a result of intensive hunting and extensive deforestation (4) with land having been cleared for agriculture and logging operations at a frightening pace (5). Hunting also poses a significant threat to this Endangered deer (5).,The Visayan spotted deer is afforded some degree of protection through its occurrence in Mt. Camlaon National Park North Negros Forest Reserve Mount Talinis/Lake Balinsasayao Reserve and the proposed West Panay Mountains National Park (5). Although Visayan spotted deer are legally protected their distribution in remote dense inland forest makes the practicalities of guard patrolling very difficult and hunting therefore continues (3). In 1990 the Philippine Spotted Deer Conservation Program was set up to initiate a captive breeding programme and a number of other conservation measures including a public education campaign and an annual series of conservation workshops (4) (5). Visayan spotted deer are currently held in captivity in Mari-it Conservation Centre in Panay two breeding centres in Negros and a dozen zoos in Europe (7). ,hunting; ,captive breeding;protected; ,1,2
Panay tarictic hornbill; tarictic hornbill,Penelopides panini,Visayan tarictic (Penelopides panini),Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Coraciiformes,Bucerotidae,Penelopides (1),Length: 45 cm (2),The forests of all the Philippine Islands from where the Visayan tarictic is known have been heavily deforested with forest cover being reduced by at least 70 percent on all the islands and Masbate Guimaras Sicogon and Pan de Azucar being almost completely deforested (2).  Such rampant destruction is almost certainly having a serious impact on the species and it may already have been exterminated from some islands.  Hunting for subsistence trade and sport has also devastated populations on some islands and it is now possibly extinct on Sicogon as a result (6).  Extensive hunting and trapping of the Visayan tarictic continues unchecked in many areas (6).,The Visayan tarictic is listed on Appendix II of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) which means that trade in this species should be carefully controlled (3).  This endangered bird also occurs in the protected areas of the North Negros Forest Reserve and Mount Canlaon Natural Park although the first only receives nominal protection and the status of Mount Canlaon has not prevented the total clearance of the lower slopes (10) (11).   On Panay the declaration of the North-Western Panay Peninsula forest as a protected area affords some protection to the Visayan tarictics breeding there (12) and the Central Panay Mountains National Park has been proposed which would encompass the majority of the island\xe2\x80\x99s Visayan tarictic population (11).  The proper protection of all these sites is an extremely important measure required for the survival of the Visayan tarictic.  The Philippine Endemic Species Conservation Project (PESCP) operates a nest protection programme for the Visayan wrinkled hornbill (<i>Aceros waldeni</i>) in north and north-west Panay which also benefits the Visayan tarictic.  Hunting and trapping of the tarictic in those areas has virtually ceased due to the monitoring and confiscations undertaken by PESCP (12).  Mount Talinis and Mount Canlaon have also been the target of conservation awareness campaigns which has reduced local hunting pressure (6) (11). ,hunting; ,cites;protected; ,1,2

Teporingo; Zacatuche,Romerolagus diazi,Volcano rabbit (Romerolagus diazi),Animalia,Chordata,Mammalia,Lagomorpha,Leporidae,Romerolagus (1),400 â 500 g (2),This scarce little-known rabbit has recently disappeared from many areas in central Mexico where it had previously been reported largely as a result of habitat destruction and hunting for sport which continue to pose an ever-present threat (1) (6). Habitat has been destroyed and degraded by intentional fires overgrazing by cattle and sheep over-exploitation of pine for timber encroaching agriculture and property developments and cutting of grasses for thatch and brush manufacture (1) (6). Nearly all fires are started by humans often originating from people burning zacaton to promote new growth of pasture for cattle and sheep (6).,Hunting of the volcano rabbit is now illegal under Mexican law but enforcement remains difficult. The species is found within two protected areas Izta-Popo and Zoquiapan National Parks but habitat destruction nevertheless continues to occur even within these areas (1) (6). In 1990 the World Conservation Union Species Survival Commission (IUCN/SSC) Lagomorph Specialist Group created an action plan for this rabbit focusing on the need to manage burning and overgrazing and to enforce laws prohibiting the capture sale and hunting of the animal (6). As a result the population of volcano rabbits is higher now than a decade ago (7). Captive breeding colonies exist at Los Coyotes Park and the Chapultepec Zoo in Mexico City but there are currently no plans to reintroduce captive-bred individuals into the wild (6) (7). ,hunting; ,captive breeding;protected; ,1,2

Capra ibex walie,Capra walie,Walia ibex (Capra walie),Animalia,Chordata,Mammalia,Cetartiodactyla,Bovidae,Capra (1),80 - 125 kg (2),Its inaccessible habitat afforded a degree of protection to the walia ibex until the arrival of modern firearms after which the population rapidly declined. Subsequently this ibex has suffered extensive hunting by local people for its meat hides and horns (2). The horns have been used by local people to make drinking mugs and also as trophies by sportsmen to decorate their homes (3). Additionally important habitat has been threatened by encroaching settlement livestock grazing and cultivation (6). Road construction is fragmenting habitat and facilitating traffic which increases the chance of erosion and noise disturbance (7). In 1963 it was estimated that between just 150 and 200 individuals remained (3) but with the creation of the Semien National Park around 1969 poaching appeared to be brought under control (2). The species is now reported to number over 500 and to be on the increase (6). A major conservation problem remaining however is that the natural habitat left is extremely limited (2).,In 1969 the Semien National Park was established to protect the habitat and the endangered wildlife it sustained and the walia ibex became a \xe2\x80\x98flagship\xe2\x80\x99 species for the area (1). The park was also placed on the World Heritage List in 1978 (7). Guards were appointed from Geech to Mietgogo to curb local poaching and illegal cultivation and burning of habitat resulting in a steady increase in numbers in the past fifteen years (3). It can be difficult to enforce the current protection laws (3) and human encroachment continues but a recent report suggests that hunting now seems to be almost non-existent (7). It appears therefore that the presence of park scouts is having some success in this respect since local attitudes do not seem to have changed to demonstrate awareness or concern for the plight of these animals (7). Propagating a greater awareness and understanding of the grave position of the magnificent walia ibex both amongst the local communities and government officials is therefore an important focus for future conservation efforts in the battle to save this Endangered species (3) (7). ,hunting;poaching; ,protection law; ,2,1

Large-scale commercial deforestation continues to pose a considerable threat to the future of Wallace\xe2\x80\x99s golden birdwing butterfly and other inhabitants of these biodiverse forests (4). In addition the extreme use of insecticides to combat mosquitoes may be having a detrimental effect on Wallace\xe2\x80\x99s golden birdwing butterfly although the impact of this has not yet been assessed (4).,While there are currently no known specific conservation measures in place for Wallace\xe2\x80\x99s golden birdwing butterfly a number of conservation organisations are working to conserve wildlife in this region of Indonesia. , , ,0,0

Animalia,Palea steindachneri,Wattle-necked softshell turtle (Palea steindachneri),Animalia,Chordata,Reptilia,Testudines,Trionychidae,Palea (1),Average length: 25 cm (2),In its natural range the wattle-necked softshell turtle is highly threatened by its use in the food trade (1). Softshell turtles are widely eaten and are also used in Chinese medicine kept as pets or released into temple ponds (2). Chinese have used turtle products for thousands of years but changes in the economy have resulted in a dramatic increase in the demand for luxury items such as turtles within the last 25 years (6).,The wattle-necked softshell turtle is listed on Appendix III of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) in China meaning that China has asked other countries for assistance in controlling the trade in this species (3). In addition in China there are numerous turtle farms breeding large numbers of wattle-necked softshell turtles. While this may have the benefit of lessening pressure on wild populations there are also a number of issues that need to be investigated further to ensure that turtle farms are not actually damaging wild populations. These issues include whether the breeding stock is replenished with wild individuals; and whether an increased availability of turtles through farming affects the demand for turtle products (6). A number of scientists have recommended that instead of attempting to adapt the farming industry for conservation purposes protected areas should be established to preserve the remaining wild populations (6). Should such measures not succeed the future survival of the wattle-necked softshell turtle may depend on those introduced populations in Mauritius and Hawaii (1). ,pet; ,cites;protected; ,1,2
Yarellâs curassow,Crax globulosa,Wattled curassow (Crax globulosa),Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Galliformes,Cracidae,Crax (1),Length: 82 - 89 cm (2),Sadly the areas surrounding the Amazonian rivers to which this species is restricted are precisely those most useful and accessible to humans with the rivers providing good transport links (2) (6). Thus these areas have undergone considerable human colonisation development and exploitation with local settlements fragmenting critical curassow habitat (7). Additionally commercial and subsistence hunting is higher in these areas because of the easy access via the rivers and hunting is the primary cause of decline for this species (2) (7). In particular the replacement of traditional hunting practices with shotguns had a dramatic impact and the wattled curassow population plummeted (6). During the 1960s this unusual and distinctive looking bird was heavily hunted for subsistence by fur traders on the r\xc3\xado Beni in Bolivia but the prohibition of fur-hunting by CITES in 1971 thankfully reduced this threat (2).,The wattled curassow is afforded some degree of protection in the Mamirau\xc3\xa1 Sustainable Development Reserve in Brazil although it nevertheless continues to be hunted there and Pacaya-Samiria National Reserve in Peru. A temporary hunting ban has been implemented in Bolivia in order to secure the future of local hunting stocks by allowing the population to recover and this has reportedly had some success (2). It has been proposed that governments and nature reserves develop and help encourage ecotourism as an alternative means of income and subsistence for local people and as a source of sustainable development for the country (2) (6). To this end Asociaci\xc3\xb3n Armon\xc3\xada the BirdLife International partner in Bolivia is channelling funds into the development of a small scale ecotourism project in San Marcos in Bolivia where the only remaining population of wattled curassows in the country is found (8) (9). Asociaci\xc3\xb3n Armon\xc3\xada has worked closely in conjunction with the local community of San Marcos to ensure that vital Bolivian populations are preserved (8). The area around this species has been petitioned as an \xe2\x80\x98indigenous territory\xe2\x80\x99 and there is now a boat to the area for tourism with plans for a lodge and trained guides cooks etc. by 2007 (9). Similar initiatives in other range nations could significantly help the recovery of this species. ,hunting; , ,1,0

In the late 1980s the population was estimated to be around 12000 animals while in 2004 it was estimated to be 5000 to 6000 (6). Many hunts are organised that focus solely on this imposing species while there is also intense competition with livestock for natural resources. These threats are exacerbated by harsh winters which take their toll on the species (1).,Currently conservation efforts for the West Caucasian tur have focused on the protection of the Nature Reserves that it inhabits. These include the Caucasus Nature Reserve and Teberda Nature Reserve which are thought to contain about 3500 turs (1). It is thought that in the future the most effective way to conserve the West Caucasian tur will be to increase protection in these reserves (1). ,pet; , ,1,0

This species\xe2\x80\x99 native prairie habitat is being increasingly lost to agriculture as well as to developments for housing and commercial use. The inappropriate management of native prairie can also have devastating effects on the Western Prairie fringed orchid damaging the plants or altering the ecology of the habitat such that it no longer favours orchids (1) (3). The annual mowing of wild hay presents a further problem to the Western Prairie fringed orchid as this removes its seed capsules before they are ripe leading to reproductive failure (1) (3).\xa0,As with other rare plant species that exist in fragments of the once vast North American prairie ecosystem the main conservation priority for the Western Prairie fringed orchid is the protection and successful management of its habitat. Several populations of this species are already afforded some protection in reserves such as in Minnesota where some 84 percent of orchids are protected and in North Dakota where over 90 percent of orchids are found on the Sheyenne National Grassland. However many populations of the Western Prairie fringed orchid occur on privately owned property where they are still at risk from habitat conversion and development (1) (3). ,loss;invasive;pet; ,protected; ,3,1

Habitat clearance and human influence over fire regimes has also contributed (1) (4).,The Department of Conservation and Land Management in collaboration with Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation Australia are working to study this species and have undertaken captive breeding programs and begin a re-introduction program in an area of the mainland where introduced predators have been drastically reduced under an eradication program.

hoolock gibbon; western hoolock,Hoolock hoolock,Western hoolock gibbon (Hoolock hoolock),Animalia,Chordata,Mammalia,Primates,Hylobatidae,Hoolock (1),5.5 â 5.6 kg (2),Populations of western hoolock gibbon are reported to have declined by a shocking 90 percent over the past 30 years as the result of numerous human activities (7) and it is now considered to be one of the most endangered 25 primate species in the world (8). As people expand their agricultural activities into forests establish tea gardens and coffee estates undertake logging and carry out other development projects forest habitat is steadily fragmented and reduced. When forests are fragmented the gibbon must spend more time on the ground moving between forest patches; at these moments it becomes extremely vulnerable to both domestic and wild dogs (7). Adding to the threat of habitat loss is the pressure of hunting with people hunting this charismatic primate for food traditional medicine and the pet trade; unfortunately the gibbon\xe2\x80\x99s beautiful songs act as a signal that guides hunters directly to them (7).,Ironically while humans have pushed the western hoolock gibbon into its precarious situation this species is now entirely dependent on human action for its survival (8). The western hoolock gibbon occurs in numerous protected areas throughout its range (1) is listed on Schedule I of the Indian Wildlife (Protection) Act of 1972 (1) (9) and organisations are working together to carry out many other conservation actions (10). Hopefully enough will be done in time to save the western hoolock gibbon; a vital member of its habitat and a flagship species for Asia\xe2\x80\x99s forests (7). ,loss;hunting;pet; ,protected; ,3,1
August frog; Cape toad; panther toad; snoring toad; southern panther toad,Amietophrynus pantherinus,Western leopard toad (Amietophrynus pantherinus),Animalia,Chordata,Amphibia,Anura,Bufonidae,Amietophrynus (1),Length: up to 14 cm (2),Although it may tolerate a degree of habitat alteration often being found in urban and suburban areas the western leopard toad is under threat from increased urbanisation housing development and agricultural expansion within its already limited range (1) (2) (3). Road kills may pose a significant threat particularly during the breeding season when the toads migrate to the breeding sites (1) (2) and urban development can also increase the physical barriers to such movements (2). In addition artificial water bodies with vertical sides such as swimming pools and stormwater drains can present death traps to toads while further threats at some breeding sites include pollution and introduced species such as predatory fish invasive plants and captive ducks which can consume eggs and tadpoles. The replacement of lawns and flowerbeds with stone and paving may also be reducing available foraging habitat (2) and there is increasing concern that the introduced guttural toad <i>Amietophrynus gutturalis</i> may compete with the western leopard toad for food and resources (8). An isolated population in the east of the range appears to be most under threat despite occurring in the least urbanised habitat (9).,The western leopard toad is legally protected within South Africa (2) and also occurs in some protected areas such as the Agulhas National Park and in the northern parts of Cape of Good Hope Nature Reserve. However most of its habitat occurs outside of reserves and is unprotected (1) (2). Fortunately a number of organisations are working to involve the public and private landholders in the toad\xe2\x80\x99s conservation. In 2007 the Western Leopard Toad Conservation Committee (WLT-CC) was formed and are helping to draft a Biodiversity Management Plan for the species (2) (9). Volunteers help rescue toads from roads during the breeding season and photographs sent in by the public are being used to monitor the toad population identifying individuals by their unique markings (2) (5). Genetic studies radio-tracking and monitoring of the invasive guttural toad are also underway (2) (5) (8) and local residents have been given advice on making swimming pools safer for toads (2). By raising awareness of urban conservation issues and promoting more \xe2\x80\x98ecofriendly\xe2\x80\x99 gardening practices the conservation of this beautiful amphibian is also likely to benefit a range of other wildlife in the Cape Province (2). ,invasive;pet;pollution; ,protected; ,3,1

Hunting pressure is believed to have caused the possible extinction of Miss Waldron\xe2\x80\x99s red colobus (8).,The western red colobus is listed on Appendix II of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) meaning that any international trade in this species should be carefully regulated (3).

Summer droughts and the illegal removal of water for intensive agriculture has reduced the habitat of this threatened fish and had a major impact on its population (2).The surviving populations of the western ruivaco are very small (4) and it is thought that the population in the Safarujo may have been lost after the stream dried up (1).,There are currently no known conservation projects relating to the western ruivaco (1) (4) but there have been pilot captive breeding studies which could be useful if reintroductions become necessary (2). This study took a population of 16 adult western ruivaco from the Alcabrichel River for captive breeding (2) and showedencouraging results.

Habitat destruction through forest felling and burning poses the principle threat to the biodiversity on Madagascar including the western woolly lemur (2). Small-scale but widespread clearing of forests is conducted for firewood cattle grazing charcoal production and construction materials. In the dry season people often set brush fires to clear pasture for cattle but the fires frequently burn out of control and threaten protected areas (8). Hunting also occurs in some regions. These factors coupled with the species\xe2\x80\x99 restricted range give cause for concern (2).,The western woolly lemur is confirmed in only two protected areas Ankarafantsika Nature Reserve and Manongarivo Special Reserve although this species has also been reported in Ankarana Special Reserve (2) (4). It has so far been impossible to keep western woolly monkeys in captivity probably because of their highly selective <strong>folivorous</strong> diet.

Wetar is regarded as one of the most biologically intact islands in Indonesia but there is a strong push for development from both the Indonesian government and local inhabitants (6). Habitat loss from gold mining road construction timber logging and agricultural expansion represents a major threat in addition to hunting in lowland forest and climate change (6) (8).,Wetar has some of the most intact monsoon forest in Asia and is consequently home to large populations of a number of <strong>endemic</strong> bird species making conservation of this forest crucial. The Bekau Huhun Nature Reserve currently covers a large area in central-west Wetar; however the boundary does not yet extend to the Naumatang Gorge area where the Wetar ground-dove is locally common (6).

Consequently in 2012 the IUCN Red List uplisted the species from Near Threatened to Endangered (1). These population declines have been caused by a combination of factors: the loss and conversion of the vulture\xe2\x80\x99s habitat for agriculture declines in wild <strong>ungulate</strong> populations reducing the availability of <strong>carrion</strong> hunting for use in traditional medicine capture for the illegal live trade (7) electrocution on electricity pylons drowning in farm reservoirs (8) persecution and poisoning (7).,A number of protected areas in Africa hold populations of white-backed vultures including Serengeti National Park in Tanzania a World Heritage Site (9).

Unfortunately the presence of insurgents in some areas complicates park management (6). There is a substantial subpopulation of this species in Colombia between the Rios Caguan and Yari.

Recent surveys have also identified populations in unprotected forests such as Vevembe that could be added to existing parks and reserves (4).

The white-handed gibbon is sometimes hunted for its meat (8) and the capture of young gibbons for the pet trade is rampant in some countries particularly Thailand (5). Frequently the mother is shot so that the young can be taken (5).,The white-handed gibbon is protected from international trade by its listing on Appendix I of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) (4). Other efforts are being made to save these primates such as national parks and reserves but they are not terribly effective as they are often poorly supervised and laws against capture un-enforced (8).

MalvasÃ­a,Oxyura leucocephala,White-headed duck (Oxyura leucocephala),Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Anseriformes,Anatidae,Oxyura (1),Length: 43 - 48 cm (2),This endangered duck faces several threats. The world population lies between 7910 to 13110 birds (2). At present the main threat to the Spanish population is its <strong>interbreeding</strong> with non-native North American ruddy ducks <i>Oxyura jamaicensis</i> which were brought to the UK in 1930s for captive wildfowl collections (8). Some young ruddy ducks escaped from captivity in 1952 and began to breed in the wild. The hybrids produced are fertile and therefore pose an increasing threat to the white-headed duck. The expansion of the ruddy duck could also threaten populations of white-headed duck across Asia (9). Evidence strongly suggests that UK birds are responsible for the ruddy duck's spread across Europe (10).,Ruddy duck populations are currently controlled in Spain Portugal and France. In the UK where the spread of the ruddy duck is believed to have originated the Government conducted a control trial that proved it is possible to eradicate the ruddy duck (11). <strong>Re-introduction</strong> schemes have also been conducted in Spain France and Italy to boost this species\xe2\x80\x99 numbers. There is hope for the recovery of the white-headed duck not least because of Spain\xe2\x80\x99s conservation achievement. In the 1970s there were only 22 individuals prompting dedicated conservation projects in Spain. These were hugely successful and there are now around 2500 ducks in Spain (12). It is hoped that other countries can follow Spain\xe2\x80\x99s success to protect the white-headed duck. In 1996 a European Action Plan was published to unite Europe\xe2\x80\x99s bird conservation groups and save the white-headed duck from extinction (5). ,loss;hunting;fishing;pollution; , ,4,0
Red-nosed bearded saki; red-nosed saki; white-nosed bearded saki,Chiropotes albinasus,White-nosed saki (Chiropotes albinasus),Animalia,Chordata,Mammalia,Primates,Pitheciidae,Chiropotes (1),Male head-body length: c. 42.7 cm (2)Female head-body length: c. 41.8 cm (2)Tail length: 30 - 50.7 cm (3),The white-nosed saki is mainly threatened by habitat destruction as its range has been divided by the Trans-Amazon highway. The Santar\xc3\xa9m-Cuiab\xc3\xa1 highway provides easy access to the Xingu-Tapaj\xc3\xb3s region making the forests vulnerable to clearance for soybean farms and infrastructure development. Soybean plantations currently threaten only a small portion of the white-nosed saki\xe2\x80\x99s range but clearance for cattle ranching is also a threat (1).,As well as being listed on Appendix I of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) (4) the white-nosed saki is protected under the Brazilian Endangered Species Act which prohibits the capture collection sale or export of this species (10). Its range also includes two reserves: the Parque Nacional da Amaz\xc3\xb4nia and Floresta Nacional do Tapaj\xc3\xb3s which offer this species some protection (1). However enforcing legislation in the region is difficult and further parks or reserves are recommended (10). , ,cites;protected;endangered species act; ,0,3
Animalia,Rhinomyias albigularis,White-throated jungle-flycatcher (Rhinomyias albigularis),Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Muscicapidae,Rhinomyias (1),Size: 17 cm (2),The white-throated jungle-flycatcher is in grave danger of extinction due to widespread habitat destruction within its lowland range. Forest on Guimaras has long since been cleared leading to the species extinction on the island and continued deforestation for shifting cultivation charcoal production and lumbar extraction threatens what little remains on Negros and Panay (2) (4). Illegal logging and harvesting of forest products such as tree ferns and rattans has been a particular problem at Ban-ban Negros and in 1991 forest at the site was considered unlikely to last more than a few years (2).,The white-throated jungle-flycatcher occurs in the tiny (0.5\xa0km\xc2\xb2) Sampunong Bolo National Park and two proposed national parks on Panay one of which contains the largest block of remnant forest in the Western Visayas. On Negros populations have been recorded in recent years at Mt.

As with all spider monkeys this species is also particularly susceptible to hunting (1) (4) with a slow reproductive rate making it difficult for populations to recover from losses (1). The decline of the white-whiskered spider monkey is predicted to continue into the future particularly as vast areas of forest are cleared to make way for soy bean plantations (1).,The white-whiskered spider monkey occurs in a number of national forests in Brazil including the Tapaj\xc3\xb3s National Forest and Xingu National Forest although more strictly protected areas will be needed for its conservation (1). Surveys are being carried out throughout the range of the white-whiskered spider monkey (1) and it has been chosen as a \xe2\x80\x98flagship\xe2\x80\x99 species for the preservation of Cristalino State Park where it is still relatively abundant (9) (10). Fauna and Flora International and the Funda\xc3\xa7\xc3\xa3o Ecol\xc3\xb3gica Cristalino together with their community education programme Escola da Amaz\xc3\xb4nia are working together to help protect the Cristalino State Park one of the most diverse areas in the region.

Wetland drainage for land hydropower development fragmentation and deliberate burning all contribute to this projected loss. However even populations found within protected areas are not free from risk. They are frequently hunted for their good quality meat and often suffer from disturbance and habitat contamination by pollution and pesticides (4).,Whilst the white-winged duck is legally protected from hunting and egg collecting across its range enforcement of this protection is lacking.

Fires are usually started by landowners trying to clear their pasture and promote grass re-growth and some spread uncontrolled into protected areas while other fires are sadly started deliberately for malicious reasons within reserves (9).,The white-winged nightjar is protected by law in Brazil and occurs in a few protected areas: Emas National Park Mbaracay\xc3\xba Forest Nature Reserve and Beni Biological Station. However active fire management is required in these areas as while occasional small-scale fires create a mosaic of suitable vegetation extensive uncontrolled wildfires can be very destructive particularly if they occur during the breeding season (7).\xa0 , ,protected; ,0,1

Grulla Americana; Grulla Gritona; Grulla Trompetera,Grus americana,Whooping crane (Grus americana),Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Gruiformes,Gruidae,Grus (1),Length: 132 cm (2),The original decline in whooping crane numbers followed the drainage and clearing of wetlands together with other human disturbances in the breeding areas and migration routes (10). Shooting for food by early settlers and specimen collection for museums and egg collectors wreaked havoc on the remaining population. Today cranes remain at risk from human development (10); collisions with power-lines are now a serious cause of mortality (6). Moreover the single population is at risk from any chance event and conservationists are particularly fearful of a chemical spill in the Gulf of Mexico that would destroy the wintering grounds in Texas (6).,The whooping crane has been the subject of an enormous broad-based conservation effort since the mid-20th Century involving the United States and Canadian Wildlife Services together with other organizations such as the Patuxent Wildlife Research Center and the International Crane Foundation (7). The multi-faceted approach has involved the protection of important habitats the monitoring of populations and a captive breeding program. The establishment of an additional migratory population was attempted in Idaho but has not proven successful (10). However greater progress has been achieved with the setting up of a non-migratory population in Florida which now numbers 86 individuals (11). Another attempt at establishing a migratory population was begun in 2001 with birds being taught a migration route from Wisconsin to Florida behind ultra-light aircraft (9). The main captive populations exist at Patuxent Wildlife Research Centre the International Crane Foundation and Calgary Zoo and have been used in these reintroduction attempts (10). These efforts have increased the wild population of these elegant birds from just 21 in the 1940s to about 300 today a truly fantastic achievement (11).<warehouse:ref entitytype="ScientificReference"></warehouse:ref><warehouse:ref entitytype="ScientificReference" id="5dc01c60-a216-4078-be7f-9cb7014e2cff"></warehouse:ref> , ,captive breeding; ,0,1

A combination of overexploitation as a fuel wood and clearance for urban development\xe2\x80\x94particularly tourist resorts\xe2\x80\x94is rapidly diminishing the population of this already rare species (1). The problem is compounded by the fact that overgrazing along with overharvesting of its fruit and seeds for food and by plant breeding companies are reducing the wild apricot\xe2\x80\x99s reproductive success and preventing it from having any chance of recovery (1) (5).,In 1984 the Chinese government listed the wild apricot in the Ily Valley as an Endangered Plant and since then a number of studies have been carried out examining its ecology (5) (6). At the present time however there do not appear to be any practical measures directed towards protecting this species or restoring its populations in China. In contrast in Kazakhstan where the wild apricot is particularly rare the \xe2\x80\x9cIn-situ Conservation of Kazakhstan\xe2\x80\x99s Mountain Agrobiodiversity\xe2\x80\x9d project has targeted two large sites in the Tien Shan Mountains for National Park status.

Under the Australian Protected Areas Programme a 132566 hectare area has been established to protect species including the woma python (6). It is important to provide incentives for landowners in this area to reduce the impact of current land use practises on this species (2).

Egg predation by skunks raccoons and opossums is becoming a serious problem due to an increase in the number of these scavengers since human settlement with egg and hatchling mortality exceeding 80 percent in some areas (6) (10). In the last few decades commercial poachers have mercilessly exploited this turtle for the pet trade range-wide and remain the primary threat to the species in a number of areas (6) (8). Significant numbers are also lost from road mortality shooting of basking turtles by vandals and incidental collection by recreationists (8). Indeed two wood turtle populations in areas of Connecticut previously closed to the public declined to virtual extinction within a decade of being exposed to human recreationists (3) (8). Because these turtles have a late onset of sexual maturity and a slow reproductive rate but a long lifespan they depend upon a long adult reproductive span to sustain population levels. Removal of just a few individuals thus has a dramatic impact and can easily lead to local extinction (3).,The wood turtle is legally protected to varying degrees by all the states and provinces where it lives and is totally protected from commercial collection and trade (5) (8). Like many endangered turtle species captive breeding may be the solution to satisfying the commercial demand for the wood turtle. Unfortunately this has led to many reptile breeders scrambling to obtain specimens while they still can (11). Thus unless its habitat is protected and the animals themselves are left undisturbed by poachers and predators the long-term future for this ornately sculpted turtle looks increasingly bleak (8). ,loss;pet; ,captive breeding;protected; ,2,2

Wax palms on which this species appears to rely so heavily have become endangered. For centuries Colombian Christians have used wax palm fronds for Palm Sunday processions and peasants fell the wax palms just to strip the highly prized young emerging fronds for sale to worshippers (6). Recruitment of new trees is extremely low due to livestock browsing on young seedlings thus preventing the natural replacement of the forest and logging in adjacent areas is increasing the tree\xe2\x80\x99s susceptibility to disease. In addition hunting of the parrots for food was prolific in Ecuador and trapping has had some impact in Colombia (4).,Thankfully due to cooperative conservation efforts the yellow-eared parrot and the wax palm have been given a new lease of life and are well on their way to recovery with a population of 660 birds a remarkable increase from an estimated 144 just a few short years ago (4) (6). A powerful alliance forged between Conservation International (CI) its partner Fundaci\xc3\xb3n ProAves and the Roman Catholic Church has ended the use of wax palm fronds in Palm Sunday services in much of Colombia and the U.S. hailed as one of the most successful biodiversity conservation campaigns in Latin American history. In 1999 Fundaci\xc3\xb3n ProAves with the support of CI American Bird Conservancy and Loro Parque Fundaci\xc3\xb3n began an intensive conservation project which included the creation of 25 private nature reserves and the reforestation of 36000 trees including 10000 wax palms (6). Breeding sites are being fenced to allow wax palm regeneration and artificial nest boxes are being provided (4). In addition national television campaigns in Colombia have helped educate the public about the problems the parrot and its habitat face and government police military and even rebel guerrilla forces now prohibit the sale or exploitation of both wax palms and yellow-eared parrots (6). The historical roosting site in Ecuador has also recently been bought and is being reforested and it is hoped that a public awareness campaign within the locality will stop hunting for food (4). ,hunting;disease; , ,2,0

The coastal forests of their habitat particularly of mainland New Zealand have been destroyed to make way for development and agriculture. Introduced sheep and cattle pose a threat as they can trample on penguin nests and overgraze the area destroying further habitat (2). In 1986 and 1990 there were two major population crashes the causes of which remain a mystery (6). The other major threat to the yellow-eyed penguin comes from introduced mammalian predators such as ferrets cats rats and dogs; juvenile penguins or adults during their moult phase are extremely vulnerable to predation and numbers have been decimated over the years (2).,The New Zealand Department of Conservation Hoiho Recovery Plan is currently underway which aims to promote the recovery of this species and to involve local people in their conservation (5). A number of schemes are already in place including the protection of certain key habitats and the removal of predators. The Yellow-eyed Penguin Trust has introduced a number of important conservation initiatives and research including the banning of dogs from certain sensitive beaches (2). The Trust is careful to work extremely closely with local residents over these sensitive issues (2).

Deforestation has been extensive with large areas cleared for agriculture pasture lumbar and settlements resulting in\xa0the loss of nesting and foraging habitat (2) (5). Nest poaching exacerbates habitat loss since nesting trees are often felled to get at nestlings destroying critical nest sites in the process (4).,The yellow-headed parrot is listed on CITES Appendix I prohibiting international trade in wild-caught specimens (3). Captive-breeding is fortunately now supplying much of the demand and most of the recent international trade has involved captive-bred birds although trapping continues to supply domestic markets and birds for illegal export. Trade is banned in Honduras and trapping and trade are banned in Belize (7). This parrot receives some protection in El Cielo Biosphere Reserve Sanoval Ranch in Mexico and in seven protected areas in Belize and there are several country-wide awareness campaigns in Mexico (2). However without further efforts to conserve habitat and control illegal domestic and international trade particularly in Mexico the yellow-headed parrot\xe2\x80\x99s future does not look bright (7). ,loss;poaching;pet; ,cites;protected; ,3,2

Taken from the wild for its meat and eggs for use in tradition medicines for the pet trade and for release into Buddhist temples (5) the yellow-headed temple turtle is now considered to be Endangered (1). Accentuating the impacts of exploitation in some areas is the threat of habitat loss. The lowland riverine habitat of the turtle in Lao PDR is unfortunately shared with high densities of people while in Malaysia suitable swamp habitat is at risk of being drained for land development. Suitable habitat is Thailand is also vulnerable to degradation with pollution and entanglement in fishing nets also affecting the yellow-headed temple turtle (5).,Throughout its range the yellow-headed temple turtle occurs in numerous protected areas and there are also national laws in place offering this species some protection although illegal trade remains of concern (5). In 2003 this turtle was listed on Appendix II of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) meaning that any international trade in this species should now be carefully monitored to ensure it is compatible with its survival (5) a measure which will hopefully go some way to aid the long term survival of this turtle. ,loss;fishing;pet;pollution; ,cites;protected; ,4,2

As a result of the shiny cowbird\xe2\x80\x99s presence on the mainland the yellow-shouldered blackbird is increasingly nesting on offshore cays (6).,The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) have produced a recovery plan to help prevent further declines in the yellow-shouldered blackbird population.

Demand for timber and land for agriculture driven by a rapid increase in the human population of south-eastern Malawi has resulted in deforestation and therefore habitat loss within this species\xe2\x80\x99 range (3). Habitat loss is a serious threat to the yellow-throated apalis and is responsible for a continuing decrease in its population size (2).,All of the areas inhabited by the yellow-throated apalis are within forest reserves and are therefore legally protected.

Conversion to farmland is the main threat to the natural habitat of eastern Ethiopia along with exploitation of trees for timber and fuelwood (5). As the yellow-throated seedeater has never been recorded from cultivated or highly degraded land it is likely to be intolerant of such habitat alteration (2). These threats extend even into so-called protected areas; increasing human pressure and tribal conflicts have impacted the Awash National Park and people and their livestock have moved into the park where fires are now a regular occurrence (2).,The yellow-throated seedeater occurs in Awash National Park but as mentioned above this is unlikely to confer much protection. There are no specific conservation measures known to be in place for this species at present but actions such as distribution and population surveys have been recommended (2). It appears that action is urgently required before the tiny population and range of the yellow-throated seedeater shrinks any further. , , ,0,0

The principle agent behind this decline was the creation of Greers Ferry Lake in 1962 which resulted in the inundation of downstream tributaries creating deep pools with increased sedimentation and lower oxygen levels in the water. As an inhabitant of shallow fast-moving streams the yellowcheek darter was displaced from much of its former range moving upstream to less suitable areas of habitat. The species\xe2\x80\x99 migratory behaviour was also disrupted while the loss of downstream refugia made the species more vulnerable to droughts resulting in the loss of many populations (7). Other threats such as the channelization of streams for agriculture and human consumption have isolated some populations and a loss of <strong>genetic diversity</strong> has been observed due to <strong>inbreeding</strong> (3) (8).,Having suffered such a severe decline the yellowcheek darter is in drastic need of major conservation measures. Indeed the species has been proposed for Threatened Status under the U.S Endangered Species Act (9). An agreement has also been made between several conservation organisations and landowners to mitigate threats to the species protect bordering terrestrial habitats; and explore potential reintroduction programmes (3). In conjunction with this several mature adults were taken from the wild in 2002 to start a captive breeding programme with the first individuals bred in 2003 and further successes in 2006 (10).\xa0 ,loss; ,captive breeding;endangered species act; ,1,2
mohua,Mohoua ochrocephala,Yellowhead (Mohoua ochrocephala),Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Muscicapidae,Mohoua (1),Size: 15 cm (2)Male weight: 30 g (2)Female weight: 25 g (2),When Europeans first arrived in New Zealand the yellowhead was still abundant but forest clearances predation by introduced mammals and competition with introduced vespulid wasps (<i>Vespula</i> spp.) and birds all had a devastating effect on the species\xe2\x80\x99 survival (3) (6). As a result this bird has disappeared from 75 percent of its former range (4). As with much of New Zealand\xe2\x80\x99s endangered fauna habitat destruction has been a major cause of decline with many forests still being cleared or modified by selective logging. Predation also poses a serious threat with yellowheads suffering periodic population crashes when stoat (<i>Mustela erminea</i>) numbers erupt (4). These eruptions follow seasons of heavy beach seeding that occur every four to six years which allow species up the food chain to multiply with populations of insects then mice and then stoats proliferating (4) (6). Stoats prey upon eggs chicks and incubating adult females that are unable to escape from the nest hole resulting in huge losses and a dramatically biased sex ratio (4) (6). Black rats (<i>Rattus rattus</i>) brought over on ships are also excellent climbers and prey upon eggs chicks and incubating females (3) (4). It is also thought that stoat control initiatives in certain areas may have reduced predation on the increasing rat population (3) (6). Competition for insects and honeydew from introduced vespulid wasps has contributed to the bird\xe2\x80\x99s disappearance from beech honeydew forests in the northern South Island and introduced finches are thought to also be competing for food and contributing to the species\xe2\x80\x99 decline (6).,A monitoring programme established in 1983 carefully tracks 14 populations of yellowheads in 12 key sites and stoats have been trapped in key habitats during years of heavy seeding (4). Survival rates in the Eglinton Valley Fiordland National Park have been closely followed for more than ten years to monitor whether stoat control efforts are having a positive impact and initial results show that intensive trapping of predators does benefit the yellowhead (3). In addition birds have been translocated to three mammalian predator-free habitats including Codfish Island in 2003 where individuals proceeded to successfully breed the following season (4). This species has also bred in captivity at Orana Park in Christchurch providing potential for future <strong>re-introductions</strong> into suitable habitats. Should <strong>re-introductions</strong> ever be deemed necessary they would help to bolster wild populations of this beautiful brightly-coloured <strong>endemic</strong> bird and greatly increase its chances of survival (3) (4) (6). ,loss;pet; , ,2,0

The human population in this remote corner of China has exploded in recent decades and forests are being cleared both for timber and to make way for agriculture (5). The populations of snub-nosed monkeys that remain are isolated in fragments of the former forest (8). Hunting of this primate was banned in China in 1975 but lack of funds and staff means that this law is hard to enforce and hunting persists (2). Monkeys are also accidentally trapped in snares set out for other wildlife (6).,The Government of China banned the hunting of snub-nosed monkeys in 1975 although this has proven difficult to enforce (2). Around half the population of the Yunnan snub-nosed monkey occurs within protected reserves such as Baima Snow Mountain Nature Reserve where wardens are trying to work closely with the local people to secure the future of this species (5). In 1998 a national logging ban on all remaining old-growth forests came into force which will help to preserve some of the monkey's precious habitat (5). Yunnan snub-nosed monkeys are a vital part of the mountain ecosystem preventing the accumulation of <strong>lichen</strong> in these ancient forests of the foothills of the Himalayas (5). ,loss;hunting; ,protected; ,2,1

At one point it was thought that the wren may be extinct as searches in the area it was first discovered were unsuccessful at finding any individuals. This was probably because the area had suffered extensive burning but fortunately further expeditions which searched areas further afield were then successful in rediscovering the Zapata wren (2). The burning of grass continues to pose a threat to the Zapata wren along with the drainage of wetlands in the region and the expansion of agriculture which destroys suitable habitat. The Zapata wren may also suffer from predation by introduced mongooses and rats (2) (4).,There are a number of protected areas within the Zapata swamp the main being Ci\xc3\xa9naga de Zapata National Park and the whole swamp has been declared an UNESCO Biosphere Reserve. However regulations in these areas are not always enforced (4).

Antilope Blanche,Addax nasomaculatus,Addax (Addax nasomaculatus),Animalia,Chordata,Mammalia,Cetartiodactyla,Bovidae,Addax (1),60 - 125 kg (2),The population of addax is today a mere fraction of what it once was and this dramatic decrease is mainly attributed to over-hunting. These slow-moving animals provide easy targets particularly with motorized vehicles and automatic weapons and their meat and leather are prized by local people (8). Other factors involved in the decline include <strong>desertification</strong> drought and habitat encroachment by pastoral expansion and subsistence agriculture (5) (10). It is estimated that fewer than five hundred individuals survive in the wild today with the bulk of these lying between the Termit area of Niger and the Bod\xc3\xa9l\xc3\xa9 region of Western Chad (9).,The addax is listed on Appendix I of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) thus prohibiting international trade (3). Provided effective protection is granted for the last remaining pockets of populations it is possible that the species can increase. With this in mind the Sahara Conservation Fund has developed a regional strategy that when implemented will protect the remaining wild populations and facilitate the recolonisation of neighbouring suitable habitats (10). A protected population exists in the Yotvata Hai-Bar (Wildlife Preserve) Nature Reserve in Israel to the north of Elat (11). The reserve was set up in 1968 with the view to bolster populations of endangered desert species (12). In Niger a vast protected area is being established in the Termit region to protect the largest remaining addax population in the wild (10). There are currently around 2000 individuals in captive populations around the world and these are being used in reintroduction programmes for the species in Tunisia and Morocco (7) (13) (14). ,hunting; ,cites;protected; ,1,2

The species is now restricted to a few forest patches in the south and east of the island where fewer than 300 may now survive\xa0(1)\xa0(4)\xa0(6). This decline is likely to be continuing with the main threats to the species being habitat loss due to illegal wood-cutting and the spread of agriculture and continued illegal hunting with the species being highly sought after for its meat and skin\xa0(1)\xa0(4)\xa0(5)\xa0(6)\xa0(9)\xa0(11). Deforestation and forest degradation has led to the severe fragmentation of the duiker\xe2\x80\x99s habitat but firewood collection unfortunately remains one of the few sources of income for many people living near the forests\xa0(1). An additional threat may be posed by the presence of feral dogs which are thought to have destroyed an introduced duiker population on Funzi Island\xa0(5).,Aders\xe2\x80\x99 duiker is a protected species in both Kenya and Zanzibar (1) although the law is often poorly enforced (9). A Species Recovery Plan is in place on Zanzibar with recommendations including improved protected status for the species the development of a new larger conservation area with a strict anti-hunting policy conservation education programmes continued population monitoring and further research into the species\xe2\x80\x99 behaviour and ecology (6). A conservation and recovery plan has also been proposed for Kenya (1). In 2000 five Aders\xe2\x80\x99 duikers were <strong>translocated</strong> to the well protected privately run conservation area of Chumbe Island where a female was already present but the success of this programme needs to be monitored (1) (4) (6). The possibility of a captive breeding programme is also being investigated (1) (3) (6) (11) while the use of trophy hunting as a conservation tool has been suggested but is controversial (1) (4) (6). ,loss;fragmentation;hunting; ,captive breeding;protected; ,3,2

There are now only a few hundred individuals left in the wild (4) and the species is under threat of extinction. These animals are hunted for food and for traditional medicine in both Ethiopia and Somalia where recent civil unrest has led to an increased number of weapons in circulation. Competition with domestic livestock for grazing and restricted access to water supplies caused by agricultural developments pose further threats to the survival of this species (4).,The African wild ass is legally protected in the countries within which it is currently found (4) although these measures often prove difficult to enforce. More effective protection measures need to be adopted if the status of this species is to improve. A protected population of the Somali wild ass exists in the Yotvata Hai-Bar (Wildlife Preserve) Nature Reserve in Israel to the north of Elat (6). This reserve was established in 1968 with the view to bolster populations of endangered desert species (7).

Flathead trout; Turkish trout,Salmo platycephalus,Ala balik (Salmo platycephalus),Animalia,Chordata,Actinopterygii,Salmoniformes,Salmonidae,Salmo (1),up to 989 g (3),The ala balik faces several threats including the introduction of non-native trout species such as rainbow trout (<em>Oncorhynchus mykiss</em>) to its habitat (1) (3) (4). Rainbow trout are predators of the <strong>larvae</strong> of the ala balik and also act as competition for both food and space (1) (4).,Despite being classified as Critically Endangered on the IUCN Red List (1) and Endangered on the Endangered Species Act (1973) (2) (6) there are very few known conservation measures in place for this species (1) (6). Fishing of this species is officially prohibited and as such may afford the ala balik some protection (4). ,fishing;pet; ,endangered species act; ,2,1

Animalia,Philydor novaesi,Alagoas foliage-gleaner (Philydor novaesi),Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Furnariidae,Philydor (1),30 - 38 g (2),The Alagoas foliage gleaner has an extremely small population and a very restricted range. As a result of logging and the conversion of habitat for agriculture the area of forest at Murici in Alagoas the site of the Alagoas foliage-gleaner's discovery has declined by more than half since the 1970s. Furthermore the remaining habitat is highly fragmented. In Serra do Urubu in Pernambuco indiscriminate exploitation of natural resources especially for making charcoal has until recently been the main threat to the last remaining significant forest remnants (3) (5).,Despite being protected under Brazilian law the Alagoas foliage gleaner is facing the very imminent threat of extinction. Fortunately SAVE Brasil (formerly BirdLife International Brasil Program) is working to conserve habitat at both Murici in Alagoas and Serra do Urubu in Pernambuco. In 2001 international and national efforts led by SAVE Brasil resulted in the creation of the Murici Ecological Station in Alagoas. Covering over 6000 hectares of protected habitat work at Murici is currently overseen by seven conservation organisations that together with SAVE Brasil form the Muruci Pact (3) (5). , ,protected; ,0,1

The area around Lac Alaotra is the largest area in Madagascar developed for rice cultivation and vast areas of the reed bed habitat have been burned and drained (1) to make way for paddy fields (6). In addition reeds are themselves harvested for products such as mats fish traps screens and fencing (6). The species is also under pressure from hunting both for food and for the pet trade (6); deliberate fires are sometimes lit to force fleeing lemurs into the path of hunters (3).,Lac Alaotra was declared a Ramsar site in 2003 with the aim of conserving biodiversity and the wetland ecosystem and there are also plans to create a strict conservation area covering the site. Public awareness campaigns have focused on the benefits of habitat conservation to the people living around the lake and a regional fishing convention bans lemur hunting and marsh burning (1). The Alaotran gentle lemur is protected from international trade by its listing on Appendix I of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) (4). There are currently small captive breeding programmes in several institutions including at the Durrell Conservation Trust in Jersey (1) (2) (7). The highly restricted nature of this species\xe2\x80\x99 distribution however means that it is vital that some of its habitat is protected to prevent yet another member of Madagascar's unique fauna from being lost. ,hunting;pet; ,cites;captive breeding;protected; ,2,3

There has been almost complete destruction of low-altitude forest across East Africa mainly for conversion to agricultural land (3) and the few remaining forests of the Eastern Arc Mountains where this species is found are under considerable pressure (5). While the main viable subpopulation of Amani flatwings is relatively safe within the Amani-Sigi Forest Reserve any other subpopulations within the vicinity are either already extinct or on the verge of extinction as a result of human encroachment forest destruction and water pollution. Even the protected population leads a relatively precarious existence containing fewer than an estimated 250 mature individuals (1).,The Eastern Arc forests of Tanzania contain many endangered species found nowhere else on Earth but remain under serious threat from an encroaching human population and are in immediate need of conservation action (5). Fortunately the stream around which the one remaining viable population lives is protected within a forest reserve in the East Usambara Conservation Area and is therefore relatively safe from any immediate danger (3). Nevertheless any changes to this stream could result in the extinction of the species and it has been advocated that an extensive survey of the whole area is urgently needed to locate any further remaining populations (1). ,pollution; ,protected; ,1,1

One of the major causes of this decline in abundance is the fragmentation of available habitat; leading to changes in the availability of carrion increased competition and the isolation of remaining popualtions (2). ,The precarious sate of the population of American burying beetles was recognised in 1989 when the species was listed as Endangered on the U.S. Fish &amp; Wildlife Service Endangered Species List (3). A Recovery Plan has been drawn up and searches for remnant populations are underway (2). In Rhode Island and Oklahoma the known populations are monitored and their habitats managed and in Massachusetts a number of beetles from a captive population at Boston University have been released (2).  ,fragmentation;pet; , ,2,0

Animalia,Diomedea amsterdamensis,Amsterdam albatross (Diomedea amsterdamensis),Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Procellariiformes,Diomedeidae,Diomedea (1),4.8 â 8.0 kg (2),This rare albatross has been imperilled by a number of human and non-human related activities and now clings to an extremely precarious existence of just 70 to 90 individuals and 10 to 20 annually breeding pairs (2) (7). A large herd of 1200 feral cattle have destroyed the vegetation cover at lower altitudes on Amsterdam Island reducing this species\xe2\x80\x99 available breeding ground. Introduced predators also pose a major threat particularly feral cats and Amsterdam Island has suffered from fires started by humans which destroy vegetation and possibly birds (2) (9). The effects of longline fisheries around the island in the 1970s and early 1980s may also be to blame for the serious decline in numbers (4) (10). Although population numbers have recently been increasing a continued decline is projected owing to the potential spread of certain diseases (Avian cholera and <i>Erysipelothrix rhusiopathidae</i>) that affect the Indian yellow-nosed albatross (<i>Thalassarche carteri</i>) population on the same island (1) (4). Indeed increased chick mortality over recent years suggests that the Amsterdam albatross population has already been affected (4).,The Amsterdam albatross is listed on Appendix I on the Convention on Migratory Species (CMS) which strives towards protecting migratory animals conserving or restoring their habitat and controlling factors that might endanger them (3). It is also on Annex 1 of the Agreement on the Conservation of Albatrosses and Petrels (ACAP) (11). All Amsterdam albatrosses are banded and the population is monitored every year. In 1987 the number of cattle was reduced and a fence erected to partition off part of the island and in 1992 a second fence was built to provide complete protection from cattle in the high plateau (4) (9). Access to the colony by humans is also now under strict control (2). Further proposals include the management of vegetation to increase suitable nesting ground investigation into the impact of cats and means of removing these predators raising awareness of <strong>bycatch</strong> problems amongst longline fishers and research into methods of preventing the spread of disease (4) (10). All these issues need to be urgently addressed if we are to ensure the future of this bird which is one of the rarest and most endangered of all albatrosses and currently in grave danger of extinction. ,disease; , ,1,0

The drop in numbers is probably attributable to a range of threats including habitat loss and poaching by hunters who are trafficking exotic animals (2). Most devastating however has been the introduction of alien species (5). Feral dogs first reported in 1994 are known to kill adult iguanas and predation by an exploding population of feral cats on juveniles is responsible for the deaths of many hatchlings each year (2) (5). The primary threat however comes from competition for food from feral livestock with the island teeming with sheep goats donkeys and cattle that have been released to roam freely across Anegada (2) (4). Grazing pressure from these livestock has radically changed the composition of vegetation available to the iguana shifting the species\xe2\x80\x99 diet to rely more on plants with secondary compounds with dubious nutritional value (2).,The Anegada Iguana Recovery Programme began in 1997 which included establishing a \xe2\x80\x98headstart\xe2\x80\x99 facility. This facility collects hatchlings and nurtures them in captivity until they can be safely released into the wild with the aim of combating the high rates of juvenile mortality due to cat predation by raising them until they are large enough that predation will not pose as great a threat (6). The first 24 were released into the wild in October 2003 with an 84 percent survival rate and a second group of 24 were released in October 2004 and these are currently being tracked (5). In the 1980s small numbers of these iguanas were removed from Anegada and restored to parts of their former range on Guana Island where the species appears to be doing well in the absence of introduced predators (1) (2). The Guana Island Wildlife Sanctuary continues to try to rid the island of sheep the only feral grazing competitor on the island which may improve the habitat there for the iguanas (1). The species was also later introduced to Necker Island (2). A national park designed to protect this Critically Endangered iguana on Anegada has been approved in principle by the Anegada Lands Committee but rampant debates over land ownership and property boundaries impede developments and must be resolved before this project can progress (2) (4). Further conservation actions advocated include a cat eradication programme and the construction of fences around protected areas to keep livestock out. Indeed despite the successes of the headstart programme it is imperative that efforts are made to control livestock and to secure protected land for the survival of this species. Without prompt action it has been suggested that these iguanas may become extinct on Anegada within the next decade (2). ,loss;poaching;pet; ,protected; ,3,1

The small numbers caught are utilised for human consumption and possibly also used for oil and fishmeal (5). A more widespread potential threat is the capture of this species as by-catch (5). As they lie on the bottom angel sharks are particularly vulnerable to <strong>by-catch</strong> in trawl fisheries an activity that has increased in the last 50 years. As a result numbers of angel sharks have declined dramatically and have even been declared extinct in the North Sea (1).,All <i>Squatina</i> species are protected within three Balearic Islands marine reserves where fishing for these species is forbidden (1). The status of the angel shark in many parts of its range is unknown (1) and the impact of fisheries is unclear (5) and thus research is required and conservation measures urgently need to be implemented (1) to assure the conservation of this unusual and distinctive shark. , ,protected; ,0,1

The tiny population of these turtles is also under constant threat from unsustainable hunting and illegal trade. There is a massive demand for this species from markets in China where they can often be found for sale as meat or traditional \xe2\x80\x98medicine\xe2\x80\x99 (2) (4).,The Annam leaf turtle is protected under Vietnam\xe2\x80\x99s wildlife protection law (4) and is also listed under Appendix II of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) which means that international trade in this species should be carefully monitored (3). Despite trade in this species being illegal the law is often poorly enforced and trade still continues (4). Various breeding programmes have recently been set up and captive populations are increasing. These programmes try to involve local school and university students to help boost local awareness of this Critically Endangered turtle\xe2\x80\x99s perilous situation (7) (9). ,hunting; ,cites;protection law;protected; ,1,3

Black and brown rats (<i>Rattus rattus</i> and <i>Rattus norvegicus</i>) were accidentally brought to the West Indies on foreign ships from Europe wreaking havoc on <strong>endemic</strong> wildlife including the Antiguan racer whose eggs and young were preyed upon (4). Then in the late 19th Century the small Indian mongoose (<i>Herpestes javanicus</i>) was introduced in an effort to control rat populations in sugar cane plantations. These quickly established themselves and systematically drove many species of terrestrial reptiles and ground-nesting birds to extinction or near-extinction amongst them the Antiguan racer (5). To make matters worse many Antiguans and visiting tourists wrongly believed the racer to be dangerous and snakes were often killed on sight (3).,In 1989 the believed extinct Antiguan racer was rediscovered on Great Bird Island where it was indeed facing imminent extinction. By 1995 only about 60 racers survived and most had been severely injured by rats (3). A conservation initiative sprang into action to save this species; Fauna and Flora International the Antigua Forestry Unit the Island Resources Foundation the Durrell Wildlife Conservation Trust the Environmental Awareness Group and Black Hills State University joined forces to create the Antiguan Racer Conservation Project (2). This award-winning project led to the eradication of rats and mongooses from Great Bird Island and 11 other offshore islands an extensive study programme and a very active education initiative for local people and visiting tourists (2). , , ,0,0

With an official estimate of probably no more than 250 mature individuals and a declining trend this cat edges ever closer to the jaws of extinction (6). Habitat loss poses a serious threat largely as the result of overgrazing by livestock (2) which has also contributed to the depletion of the leopard\xe2\x80\x99s prey base (7). Hunting of both the leopard and its prey has also had a dramatic impact on the cat\xe2\x80\x99s survival contributing to it becoming one of the rarest animals in the world today (4). The leopards in Yemen are under particular pressure from hunting persecution from local shepherds and capture for trade (7) threats that are thought to be the main contributors to the species\xe2\x80\x99 demise (8). Sadly significant conflict arises from many people considering the leopard to be a threat to their domestic stock (8) with leopards probably often being blamed for kills by wolves and unexplained livestock losses (9).,Fortunately the situation is much more hopeful in Oman than in Yemen with the leopards of the Dhofar Mountains benefiting from comprehensive conservation measures (8). The first significant step to conserve the Arabian leopard was taken in 1985 when the region\xe2\x80\x99s first captive breeding group was established at the Omani Mammal Breeding Centre in Muscat (8). Since then captive breeding efforts at a number of institutions have been successful with several cubs born at the Breeding Centre for Endangered Arabian Wildlife in Sharjah United Arab Emirates. Such captive breeding programmes are essential in maintaining genetic diversity and saving this species from extinction (4). Nevertheless these successes need to be matched by equal successes in conservation efforts <glos><i>in-situ </i></glos>(2) without which potential reintroductions into the wild would be destined to fail (6). ,loss;hunting; ,captive breeding;protected; ,2,2

Geoemyda arakana; Geoemyda depressa,Heosemys depressa,Arakan forest turtle (Heosemys depressa),Animalia,Chordata,Reptilia,Testudines,Bataguridae,Heosemys (1),Carapace length: to 26.3 cm (2),The greatest threat thought to face the Arakan forest turtle is over-collection from the wild both for local consumption and commercial export to the Asian food markets particularly those of China and Thailand (5)\xa0(7). Not only are these turtles consumed but their shells are also sold for traditional medicinal use (5). Hunting usually involves using trained dogs to search out the turtles but limited burning of bamboo forests to intercept and capture fleeing turtles also takes place. Fortunately the market demand for this species is relatively low and current harvesting levels are thought to be minimal. Extensive tracts of habitat remain and the human population density of the region is amongst the lowest in Southeast Asia (6). Nevertheless habitat loss and degradation may represent additional threats due to logging operations road construction forest clearance for agriculture large-scale bamboo harvesting for a proposed paper mill and uncontrolled forest fires (5) (6). Furthermore this turtle\xe2\x80\x99s restricted geographic range low population density late onset of sexual maturity and low reproductive output render it vulnerable to overexploitation (5) (6). These combined threats have left the species in grave danger of extinction so much so that it was officially recognised in 2003 as one of the world\xe2\x80\x99s top 25 most endangered turtles (4).,The Arakan forest turtle is listed as a Protected Species in the Protection of Wildlife Wild Plants and Conservation of Natural Areas Law of Myanmar which was enacted in 1994. Furthermore two large areas in the Arakan Yoma Hill range Thanlwe-ma-e-chaung and Taungup Pass/Thandwe-chaung have been proposed for official protected status. These areas are found just south of known Arakan forest turtle inhabited zones and possess similar habitat types as those currently used by the species (5). This turtle may already occur in the vicinity of these proposed protected areas although no records exist or could potentially be introduced to the regions should they be given protected status. Good numbers of this species exist in captivity where attempts are being made to better understand its biology which could help to guide effective conservation plans or possibly even lead to captive breeding and reintroduction programmes in the future (4). In the meantime captive stock acts as an insurance population that buffers against total extinction. Nevertheless it is imperative that every effort is now made to protect this little-known species which managed to elude detection for so long if we are to prevent it from disappearing from the wild forever. ,loss;hunting; ,captive breeding;protected; ,2,2
Animalia,Antilophia bokermanni,Araripe manakin (Antilophia bokermanni),Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Piridae,Antilophia (1),Length: 14.5 cm (2),Although the threats facing this species are not yet fully known it is thought that habitat loss and degradation as a result of human encroachment for development and recreation as well as clearance for agriculture (particularly banana maize beans and tomatoes) and cattle is the main threat (2). The chapada region has suffered intense human pressure recently and the locality at which the species was first described has been turned into a recreational park. The species does still occur in the area but the effects of the resulting influx of humans is unknown (4).,The location at which this beautiful bird is found is within the Araripe National Forest and a larger Environmental Protection Area but these designations do not prevent disturbance or exploitation (2). It is imperative that this area is designated as a biological reserve or a national park (2). Thankfully the owner of the land next to the type locality resolved to protect the habitat after this species was discovered. A project supported by the British Petroleum Conservation Leadership Programme is underway to shed light on the ecology of this species and to assess the main threats facing it as well as opportunities for its conservation (4). Urgent action must be taken if this critically endangered and recently discovered species is to escape extinction (2). ,loss; , ,1,0

Arubian cascabel,Crotalus unicolor,Aruba Island rattlesnake (Crotalus unicolor),Animalia,Chordata,Reptilia,Squamata,Viperidae,Crotalus (1),0.9 - 1.4 kg (2),This species is threatened because it only occurs on one small island where just ten square kilometres of habitat remains undisturbed. In past centuries much of the island\xe2\x80\x99s trees were cut down for charcoal and firewood removing this snake's shelter and prey (6). Recent threats include resort development on the island and other forms of human encroachment. Goats have been introduced and have wreaked havoc on the vegetation. This species is also caught and illegally exported for the pet trade (4).,The Government and people of Aruba do recognise this <strong>endemic</strong> species as important and have set aside a large area of interior land as protected habitat for this and other species (2). The American Zoo and Aquarium Association (AZA) Aruba Island rattlesnake Species Survival Plan (SSP) is currently building on the island\xe2\x80\x99s conservation efforts. Field research is being carried out to determine population size natural history traits and factors affecting the survival of the Aruba Island rattlesnake in order to best inform conservation efforts. There is also an ongoing public relations campaign to change local people\xe2\x80\x99s perceptions of this venomous snake (6). Captive breeding has also been initiated in zoos associated with the SSP program to increase population numbers and the genetic health of this threatened snake (4) (6). ,pet; ,captive breeding;protected; ,1,2

Declines in colonies at Cross Hill have been attributed to the cottony cushion scale insect (<em>Icerya purchasi</em>) which has been introduced to the island (2).

white-rumped vulture,Gyps bengalensis,Asian white-backed vulture (Gyps bengalensis),Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Falconiformes,Accipitridae,Gyps (1),Length: 75 â 85 cm (2),The Asian white-backed vulture was once the commonest vulture in the Indian subcontinent and was abundant throughout its range (4). Populations in South East Asia had all but disappeared by the mid-20th century. These declines have been attributed to direct causes such as hunting and live capture as well as the indirect effects of a reduction in carrion as hygiene improved across the region (5). Having suffered an extremely rapid decline in numbers due to a previously unknown cause the Asian white-backed vulture is in danger of imminent extinction without immediate conservation action. By 2000 dead and dying <i>Gyps</i> vultures were being found so frequently in Nepal and India it was thought that they were suffering from an epidemic. The unnaturally high death toll was thought to be caused by a fatal virus but testing has revealed that vultures are suffering from kidney failure following the consumption of cattle that had previously been treated with the anti-inflammatory drug diclofenac (2). In fact the decline is a result of a lethal level of the drug in a small proportion of the <strong>ungulate</strong> carcasses available to vultures but as vultures travel long distances to reach <strong>carrion</strong> a considerable proportion of the population has been affected (6).,It is necessary to prevent exposure of vultures to livestock carcasses that have been contaminated with diclofenac and to find an alternative replacement drug (7). Government commitment to the control of the use of the drug is crucial but until it has been entirely removed from the environment a collaboration of bird protection organisations plan to take all Asian white-backed vultures into captivity for the next 20 to 30 years to avoid further deaths which would further reduce the chance of a successful recovery of this already rare species (7). ,hunting; , ,1,0

The fish has excellent quality flesh and has been at risk of spear-fishing for recreation and sport (2) (4).,During the 1980s there was an observed reduction in numbers within <strong>spawning</strong> aggregations of the Atlantic goliath grouper dropping from over 100 individuals per location to fewer than 10 individuals and numbers were suspected to have been reduced by 80 percent. This prompted legislative protection preventing fishing of this species.

The development of river systems in particular the construction of hydroelectric dams destroys the breeding habitat of this species and adults are no longer able to return to their <strong>natal</strong> rivers to breed (8). Today only a single reproductive population remains and the species is consequently extremely vulnerable to extinction (5).,The Atlantic sturgeon is protected from international trade by its listing on Appendix I of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) (3).

Previously capture of this species for the international pet and research trade contributed to population declines but the axolotl now breeds well in captivity alleviating this threat. It was also captured for consumption by local people although numbers are now too low for this. The most significant threat to the axolotl is the increasing pollution of the lakes and canal system as Mexico City continues to grow (1). Land drainage flood control and sewage disposal methods from the 17th century to the present have all contributed to the destruction of the water system of Mexico City (3).,Recent stabilisation of axolotl numbers may be attributable to the restoration of the Parco Ecologico Xochimilco over the last 20 years. This protected area requires continued restoration to support the axolotl population which it is hoped may begin to increase with the introduction of captive-bred axolotls. The axolotl is protected under category Pr (special protection) by the government of Mexico (1). ,pet;pollution; ,protected; ,2,1

This indiscriminate loss of birdlife impacts not only on those birds that are already deemed to be under threat but all other birds in the area. Whilst some <i>Aythya</i> species are not as vulnerable as the Baer\xe2\x80\x99s pochard hunters are usually unable to distinguish between them anyway and so cannot spare those individuals that may prove to be so important in maintaining a viable population of Baer\xe2\x80\x99s pochard. Eggs are also collected from nests and as well as the obvious drop in reproductive output this causes the breeding grounds become less suitable as a result of the disturbance causing other nests to be abandoned (4).,Killing this species is banned in Mongolia Hong Kong Myanmar and some provinces in China but the large-scale hunting methods used and the difficulty in distinguishing Baer\xe2\x80\x99s pochard from other duck species notably from the similar ferruginous duck (<i>Aythya nyroca</i>) make it difficult to enforce the laws. This and many other waterfowl species would benefit from a ban on the spring shooting of ducks in Russia and the creation of more protected areas in addition to those Baer\xe2\x80\x99s pochard already uses. The education of hunters as to the identification of threatened species may help and it is important that Baer\xe2\x80\x99s pochard is upgraded to become a nationally protected species in mainland China and is put on Schedule I of the Wildlife Act of India (4). ,loss;fishing; ,protected; ,2,1
Bartschâs iguana; Turks and Caicos ground iguana; Turks and Caicos iguana,Cyclura carinata,Bahamas rock iguana (Cyclura carinata),Animalia,Chordata,Reptilia,Squamata,Iguanidae,Cyclura (1),Male snout-to-vent length: up to360 mm (2)Female snout-to-vent length: up to290 mm (2)Male weight: up to1.86 kg (2)Female weight: up to1.14 kg (2),At least 13 iguana subpopulations most on relatively large islands have disappeared over the last 20 years predominantly due to ongoing habitat loss and the spread of introduced or feral mammal predators with this decline apparently accelerating (1). The primary threat in the Turks and Caicos Islands is introduced mammals such as cats dogs and rats which managed to almost completely destroy one population of 5000 iguanas on Pine Cay in just three years (5). Worryingly feral cats have recently crossed a newly formed sand spit from Pine and Water Cay to Little Water Cay an important nature reserve that was previously cat-free. Feral livestock such as goats cows donkeys and horses also pose a significant threat through competing for food altering vegetation compositions of the islands and trampling soft substrates where these iguanas borrow and nest. Development for tourism is an increasing cause of habitat loss and an additional cause for concern. The population of the Bartsch\xe2\x80\x99s iguana subspecies on Booby Cay has been protected to a degree by the fact that the cay is not readily accessible from the settlements on Mayaguana minimising disturbance. The main immediate threat to this population on Booby Cay is the presence of goats which are over-browsing vegetation and causing extensive habitat degradation. Environmental catastrophes here such as hurricanes or storm surges also pose a very real danger (1).,Many of the Turks and Caicos Islands are protected by being encompassed in national parks nature reserves and sanctuaries a number of which support Bahamas rock iguana populations. Unfortunately many of these reserves still suffer from the effects of introduced mammals and few government resources have been allocated to maintain or enforce protection of non-marine parks (1). However the establishment of the National Trust for the Turks and Caicos Islands in 1994 has significantly increased the conservation of terrestrial wildlife. The National Trust has been granted stewardship of Little Water Cay and similar transfers of Little Ambergris and East Bay Cays are currently pending. On Little Water Cay boardwalks and observation towers have been constructed at two popular landing sites to reduce the damaging impacts of tourism and a visitation fee has been implemented with the proceeds going towards supporting conservation activities. A trapping programme to remove feral cats from Pine Water and (if necessary) Little Water Cays has also been established by the National Trust (5). ,loss;poaching;environmental;environment;pet; ,protected; ,5,1

The main threat causing the decline of this species in recent years is illegal fishing using electricity which has accounted for 40 percent of known deaths. The dolphins have also become caught in fishing gear and engineering explosions used to keep navigation channels open are another source of mortality. Vessels carrying pesticides occasionally overturn causing poisoning of the ecosystem resulting in further deaths (6). An additional source of pollution comes from the 15.6 billion cubic meters of wastewater discharged into the Yangtze every year 80 percent of which is not treated. A huge volume of boat traffic uses the river; noise levels are high and boat strikes a possibility. Furthermore the banks of the Yangtze have been greatly modified in order to prevent flooding of adjacent land; such projects have great impacts on the ecosystem both during construction and from the resulting habitat changes. Dam construction has been shown to reduce the availability of fish which is exacerbated by over-fishing and pollution. The recent construction of the infamous Three Gorges Dam the largest dam in the world is likely to affect fish stocks and natural flooding patterns (2). For many years the baiji population is thought to have been very small which in itself may have caused serious problems; small populations often suffer low genetic fitness and are often less able to adapt to environmental changes (2).,In Chinese folklore the baiji is dubbed \xe2\x80\x98Goddess of the Yangtze\xe2\x80\x99 a beneficent animal once revered by the fishing people of the river. The species was declared a National Treasure of China and has been a protected species since 1975 (3). However this had very little effect on the population which continued to decline despite conservation efforts and legal protection. It was thought that the only chance to save the species from extinction would be to remove all of the surviving individuals from the Yangtze into the \xe2\x80\x98Baiji Semi-natural Reserve\xe2\x80\x99 which was created in 1992 (6). However since the unsuccessful search for any surviving baijis in 2006 it is unlikely that a captive breeding programme will now ever be possible (4). The World Conservation Union (IUCN) has now classified the baiji as Critically Endangered (Possibly Extinct); it cannot be definitively classified as Extinct until further surveys are undertaken (1). Sadly it seems that this goddess of the Yangtze will be the first <strong>cetacean</strong> species to become extinct in modern times as a result of human activities (5). ,fishing;environmental;environment;pollution; ,captive breeding;protected; ,4,2

Indeed with an annual decline estimated at around eight percent this highly threatened seabird could go extinct within the next 40 years (10). At present the greatest threat to the Balearic shearwater is thought to be unnatural adult mortality (11)\xa0(12). On land this may be caused by predation by introduced cats rats and genets (<em>Geneta geneta</em>) and the species may have gone extinct on Cabrera Island as a result (6). At sea this species has a close association with trawlers from which it takes fish discards and mass mortality has been observed where fish lines have come too close to large groups of birds (2).\xa0,Recognising the tragic fate of the Balearic shearwater the Balearic Government introduced a recovery plan in 1997 which aimed to increase the population and its distribution to all suitable areas of habitat (6). The implementation of this plan has seen the eradication of rats from several nesting sites and the creation of three Special Protected Areas which protect all nesting areas (2). However despite these efforts addressing the high rate of mortality at sea remains a crucial factor in avoiding the extinction of this species (10). This majestic seabird is also benefiting from a large number of studies into its ecology population size distribution priority conservation areas and threats (2). ,loss;pet;pollution; ,protected; ,3,1

Although the region is still relatively undisturbed Sianda creek and parts of Kataba creek have already been developed into canals reducing habitat availability for the fish. As the local human population increases it is likely that intensified agriculture will lead to pollution of the banded neolebias\xe2\x80\x99s habitat from fertilisers and herbicides. Deforestation will also be likely in the area surrounding the floodplain causing various negative effects on the local ecosystem (1).,There are currently no measures in place to protect the banded neolebias. However various strategies have been proposed including further study of its biology assessments of its population and analysis of its threats. In addition the creation of a protected area encompassing its range continual population monitoring and prevention of invasion by the Nile tilapia have been recommended (1).

The total wild population is believed to number just 1300 reproductive individuals with only 100 existing on Mauritius. The threat to this species is further compounded by the fact that its reproduction success and reestablishment is very poor. The reasons for this are currently unclear but are likely to be due to consumption of the palm\xe2\x80\x99s fruit and seedlings by introduced animals such as rats and pigs (2) (3).,In order to help preserve wild populations of barbel palm the Office National des For\xc3\xaats on R\xc3\xa9union has undertaken an extensive restoration programme (3). Their efforts may be aided by the recent discovery of a large population of this species on Rodrigues which has the potential to provide an abundance of plant material to establish new stocks (2) (3). , , ,0,0

Plantae,Aloe pillansii,Bastard quiver tree (Aloe pillansii),Plantae,Tracheophyta,Liliopsida,Liliales,Asphodelaceae,Aloe (1),Height: up to 10 m (2),Recent surveys of the bastard quiver tree in the Richtersveld region of the Northern Cape Province of South Africa as well as in Namibia suggest that there has been very little successful reproduction in the last 100 years. In addition many of the older trees are dying indicating that the population does not appear to be naturally regenerating (5) (7). The rarity of the bastard quiver tree may be partly attributed to their habitat; in harsh environments the problems of survival are amplified (5). Similar declines in population regeneration in sister species <i>Aloe dichotoma</i> (the quiver tree) have been attributed to climate change (8) and it is very likely that the bastard quiver tree is being affected similarly. These effects are worsened by the removal of plants by horticultural collectors as well as through herbivory by baboon porcupines rock rabbits and livestock which also trample young plants\xa0(4) (5) (7). Populations may also be affected by damage caused by leaf scale insects and by base metal mining in Namibia (9).,Bastard quiver trees are protected in South Africa and Namibia (10) and are listed on Appendix I of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) effectively banning international trade in wild plants of this species (1). Further research into this important species is vitally needed together with the careful monitoring of existing populations (5). Bastard quiver trees are a vital component of the <strong>Succulent Karoo</strong> ecosystem and an important tourist draw to the region thus making conservation efforts imperative for the area. ,environment; ,cites;protected; ,1,2
tuntong,Batagur baska,Batagur (Batagur baska),Animalia,Chordata,Reptilia,Testudines,Bataguridae,Batagur (1),Length: up to 60 cm (2),Numbers of batagur have been decimated by the loss of habitat and the over-collection of both adults and eggs (5). Recently there has been an increase in the market for turtle meat and eggs in Asia and the resulting unsustainable harvest has pushed many species to the brink of extinction (7). It is estimated that batugars in Malaysia declined by over 90% during the 20th Century (8) and the species is now considered to be Critically Endangered (1).,These turtles are listed on Appendix I of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) (3); international trade is thus prohibited although illegal collection is still widespread (1). The Bronx Zoo in New York has recently achieved the first captive breeding of batagurs and this may offer a glimmer of hope for the survival of this fascinating turtle (5).  ,loss; ,cites;captive breeding; ,1,2

Hunting was particularly rampant during the 1960s when large areas of forest were cut down to plant teak affording hunters easier access (7).  Around 1977 hunting of the Bawean deer diminished giving populations the respite they needed to recover slightly (7).,In 1979 the Bawean Island Nature Reserve was established (7) offering the mountainous habitat of the Bawean deer some much needed protection.  Management activities on the island have included protecting the deer from hunting the controlled burning of grasslands to provide deer habitat and the thinning of teak plantations to encourage understorey development on which the deer can browse (7) (9).  The removal of wild dogs has also been recommended (9).  A number of Bawean deer also occur in zoos around the world (4) acting as a safeguard against this species extinction should the worst happen on Bawean Island. ,hunting; , ,1,0

In some areas the effects of intense habitat disturbance are exacerbated by hunting pressure (11); bearded sakis are hunted for <strong>bushmeat</strong> (12) and their tails are reportedly used as dusters (7).  This perilous combination of habitat destruction and hunting along with the bearded saki\xe2\x80\x99s specialised diet and preference for undisturbed forest (7) has led some to regard the bearded saki as the most endangered primate in the Amazon (4).,The bearded saki is listed on Appendix II of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) meaning that any international trade in this species should be carefully monitored (3).  However to ensure the future survival of this highly threatened primate adequately protected reserves and a captive breeding programme are said to be urgently required (7). ,hunting; ,cites;captive breeding;protected; ,1,3

Animalia,Libellula angelina,Bekko tombo (Libellula angelina),Animalia,Arthropoda,Insecta,Odonata,Libellulidae,Libellula (1),,Once relatively abundant bekko tombo populations have undergone drastic declines in recent decades as a result of habitat destruction and degradation and introduced predators. Ponds have been filled to allow urban expansion or in some urban areas ponds have been made into artificial ponds with concrete banks which may be unsuitable for this species. Likewise grassy fields which females and immature males rely upon for refuges have greatly diminished in recent years (1). Introduced alien species such as <i>Procambarus clarkii</i> (Crustacea) <i>Micropterus salmoides</i> (carnivorous fish) and <i>Myocastor coypus</i> (a large semi-aquatic rodent) have also contributed to the dragonfly\xe2\x80\x99s demise either through direct predation or through feeding on the water plants that sustain this native species (1) (5). Sadly the pattern of decline is only expected to continue (1).,Considered a national natural treasure in Japan (5) the bekko tombo became protected by the Japanese Ministry of Environment in 1993 and collection is prohibited by law (1). Nevertheless this does little to protect the dragonfly\xe2\x80\x99s disappearing habitat (1). Thus some <strong>NGOs</strong> have begun to conserve this insect and its habitat at specific pond sites for example at Okegaya Imuta Misumi and Noyori-shin ponds (1) (6). At Misumi Pond the Oita Dragonfly Society is feeding and breeding the larvae of bekko tombo to help restore the diminished population with 149 larvae successfully hatching in spring 2005 in tanks installed in the pond. The Oita Dragonfly Society is also observing the mating and egg-laying behaviour of females with the hope that the information gained will help them in their breeding scheme (6). Thus despite an ongoing decline national pride in this native dragonfly provides an element of hope for its future in Japan at least through inspiring concerted conservation efforts by dedicated individuals and organisations such as the Oita Dragonfly Society. , ,protected; ,0,1

The eggs are highly prized as caviar for both their quality and quantity (4). The beluga is the most famous of the caviar sturgeons and is featured in the Guinness Book of Records as the most expensive fish (3). Previously effective management of Caspian Sea fisheries have recently collapsed and illegal fishing is now rife; the U.S Fish and Wildlife Service estimated in 1998 that more than 50 percent\xa0of worldwide caviar trade was illegal (9). In addition habitat destruction through the pollution of coastal habitats and the alteration of river systems through dams pollution and silting have further affected beluga numbers (4). The Volgograd Dam for example has blocked almost all beluga spawning grounds (9).,The Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) (7) imposed a six-month ban on sturgeon catches in June 2001 but conservationists are concerned that this has not gone far enough to save the beluga sturgeon (6). The majority of the sturgeon population is now supported artificially (8); hatcheries may be the sole reason belugas still persist in the Caspian Sea (9). The United States is the biggest importer of caviar and the Fish and Wildlife Service is currently considering listing the species under the Endangered Species Act effectively banning importation (6) but time is running out in the fight to save this ancient fish ,fishing;overfishing;pollution; ,cites;endangered species act; ,3,2

Grasslands throughout its range are threatened by drainage conversion to agriculture overgrazing heavy flooding and inappropriate cutting and burning regimes (6).  The Tonle Sap grasslands an extremely important area for breeding Bengal floricans have declined by 60 percent since the late 1990s with the intensification of rice cultivation playing a significant role in this loss in recent years (7).  However not all human activity should be looked upon as negative as many grasslands in the absence of large native herbivores rely on activities such as grazing and burning for their existence (7).  Unfortunately reaching the correct balance of human activities is not an easy task and the management of many grasslands even those within protected areas results in habitat unsuitable for the Bengal florican (8).,The Bengal florican occurs in a number of protected areas including the Royal Chitwan National Park and Royal Bardia National Park in Nepal (8) Dudwa National Park in India and possibly in Tram Chim National Park Vietnam and Ang Trapeang Thmor Sarus Crane Conservation Area in Cambodia (6).  Within some of these areas efforts are underway to maintain the valuable grasslands such as uprooting woody vegetation (8) and a schedule of controlled fires and the collection of cut grass by locals for thatch (8) (10).  This will help create more suitable habitat for the Bengal florican (8) provided that burning and cutting is carried out before the breeding season otherwise these activities could be detrimental to the eggs or young birds (4) (10).  The worrying loss of grassland habitat in the Tonle Sap led to the designation in 2006 of 310 square kilometres of land as Integrated Farming and Biodiversity Areas.  Within these areas large scale habitat conversion is forbidden but extensive traditional use is encouraged (7). ,loss;hunting; ,protected; ,2,1

These steps are vital if an effective conservation management strategy is to be put into action. Data on population numbers and distribution is also severely lacking and people in Bermuda are encouraged to keep a vigilant eye out for the species (3).

It is estimated that the number of Biznaguitas in the wild has declined by as much as 75% since its discovery in the mid-1980s principally as a result of over-collection (1). ,In recognition of the worrying population decline the Biznaguita was upgraded to Critically Endangered on the World Conservation Union's (IUCN) 2002 Red List of Threatened Species (1).

It causes wasting of the foot muscle preventing the abalone from properly adhering to a rock causing the abalone to become discoloured lose weight and die. Population losses in each area ranged from 20% to total (1).,All abalone fisheries in California are managed by the California Department of Fish and Game which restricts the size of abalones caught and the season in which harvesting can take place. In Mexico there is a total allowable catch limit for black abalones.

RhinocÃ©ros Noir,Diceros bicornis,Black rhinoceros (Diceros bicornis),Animalia,Chordata,Mammalia,Perissodactyla,Rhinocerotidae,Diceros (1),800 - 1,400 kg (2),Black rhinoceros have been poached to the brink of extinction due to the demand for their horn both for use in Chinese traditional medicine and for traditional dagger handles in Yemen the demand for which exploded in the 1970s due to the increased income of oil-rich Gulf States (7). It is estimated that between 1970 and 1992 around 96 percent of the black rhinoceros population was lost (8).,The population crash in the latter half of the 20th Century saw rhinoceros numbers plummet to a low of about 2400 individuals (4). A variety of conservation approaches have been adopted which have resulted in the stabilisation and partial recovery of populations in a number of countries. The most successful have involved the rigorous protection of rhinoceros in fenced sanctuaries often in partnerships between the State and private sectors or in intensely protected unfenced zones within larger areas (4). Dehorning has also been used in some countries to reduce the incentives to poach (4). In 1997 Yemen became a signatory of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) thus greatly reducing the demand for rhinoceros horn in the Middle East (7). By 2001 the continental black rhinoceros population had increased to 3100 with populations in six of the eight range states increasing (4). Most individuals are conserved in heavily protected areas. The African Rhino Specialist Group of the World Conservation Union (IUCN) provides advice on the conservation of African rhinoceros and has developed a detailed Action Plan which provides extensive information and strategic direction for their conservation (4). , ,cites;protected; ,0,2
Giant sea bass,Stereolepis gigas,Black sea bass (Stereolepis gigas),Animalia,Chordata,Actinopterygii,Perciformes,Polyprionidae,Stereolepis (1),up to 255.6 kg (2),The black sea bass has been massively over-fished in both California and Mexican waters leaving this water giant Critically Endangered. Indeed so dramatic were these declines that between 1932 and 1980 commercial landings diminished from 115 tonnes biomass to 5 tonnes in Californian waters and from 363 tonnes to 12 tonnes in Mexican waters. The species\xe2\x80\x99 limited distribution large size and aggregation in spawning areas made it an easy target for fisheries (1). Unfortunately its slow growth and late onset of sexual maturity make the fish extremely vulnerable to population collapses from over-fishing and slow to recover (5). Additionally it appears that the black sea bass may also be suffering from toxin poisoning. Sediments along the coast of California have been found to carry very high levels of toxins such as DDE and PCB with an area off the Palos Verdes peninsula thought to contain possibly the highest loads of DDE (a breakdown product of DDT) in the world\xe2\x80\x99s oceans. The toxins cannot be broken down so as a mid-level predator black sea bass ingest the cumulative toxins in increased concentrations from the food chain below it and have been found to be carrying extremely high body burdens of DDE and PCB in southern California. The chemicals have been recorded to interfere with normal reproductive biology in other species of fish as well as amphibians reptiles and birds but more research is needed into the effects they are having on this giant fish and its process of recovery in California (3).,The black sea bass has been protected in California since 1981 and in Mexico since 1992. Both commercial and recreational fishing of this species were prohibited in California in 1981 although two fish per angler per trip are allowed to be caught south of the U.S.-Mexican border and one fish per trip to be taken incidentally by commercial fishermen. The law also limited the amount of black sea bass that could be caught in Mexican waters and landed in California (1). Although these laws have prevented commercial fishermen from targeting and profiting from these fish they have failed to protect the habitats occupied by the species from fishing and have probably done little to reduce incidental mortality since black sea bass entangled in nets have simply been discarded back into the sea (5). Indeed many fish in spawning aggregations in the summer have been caught and released frequently receiving injuries in the process (6). However the banning of gill nets in California in 1990 has probably helped significantly reduce the incidental mortality of this species and anecdotal data suggest that numbers may be beginning to rebound (1) (5). Nevertheless either voluntary or imposed seasonal and/or area closures would undoubtedly help further minimise incidental mortalities and greatly aid the recovery of this magnificent and dramatic giant of the sea (3) (6). ,fishing; ,protected; ,1,1

When human activities encroach upon rainforest habitat this species is one of the first lemurs to disappear (1). Hunting also threatens this rare primate; unfortunately its large size and daylight activity pattern makes it an attractive target and it is among the most heavily hunted of all Madagascar\xe2\x80\x99s lemurs (1).,The black-and-white ruffed lemur occurs in a number of protected areas such as Mananara-Nord National Park Zahamena National Park and Mantadia National Park. Although sadly this Critically Endangered species has also vanished from other areas such as Analamazaotra Special Reserve and Andringitra National Park and other forests urgently require protection if this species is to survive (1). The black-and-white lemur has been the subject of captive breeding efforts with a number being reintroduced to Madagascar\xe2\x80\x99s Betampona Reserve between 1997 and 2001 (1) (9). Unfortunately this has had limited success as animals that have not grown up in the wild typically have great difficulty adapting (9). Reintroduction is a long and costly process (9) and is rendered worthless if there is no safe natural habitat in which they can be released into. Thus hopefully efforts to protect Madagascar\xe2\x80\x99s habitats by numerous conservation organisations will be successful. ,loss;hunting; ,captive breeding;protected; ,2,2

Gibbons throughout the region have undergone dramatic declines due principally to this habitat loss but also as a result of hunting (4). The fragmentation of their habitat causes groups to become separated from the remaining population (2) and it is estimated that about 75 percent of the black crested gibbon\xe2\x80\x99s original habitat has already been lost (9). The taxonomic confusion surrounding this species makes population estimates particularly difficult but at least two of the subspecies are today at critically low levels (1).,The black-crested gibbon is protected from international trade by its listing on Appendix I of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) (3). Fauna and Flora International (FFI) have been studying the species in Northern Vietnam since 1999. They have also been involved in a community awareness programmes in the area and there is pressure to designate the last stronghold of the species (the Che Tao Forest) as a Gibbon Sanctuary (4). In China the largest population of the Central Yunnan black crested gibbon subspecies occurs within the Wuliang Mountain National Reserve (4).

Barbara Brown's titi; Northern Bahian blond titi; Northern Bahian blond titi monkey,Callicebus barbarabrownae,Blond titi monkey (Callicebus barbarabrownae),Animalia,Chordata,Mammalia,Primates,Pitheciidae,Callicebus (1),Callicebus (1),Extremely close to extinction the total population of the blond titi monkey is estimated at no more than 250 individuals (1). A victim of extensive habitat loss this rare monkey survives in highly fragmented relict populations each numbering no more than 50 individuals (1). The blond titi monkey is only found in the Atlantic forests of Brazil a region characterised by intensive habitat conversion and degradation. Despite only ten percent of original forest remaining urban and agricultural encroachment and the development of coffee and sugarcane plantations continue to threaten the area. Rapid urbanisation also threatens the blond titi monkey through road collisions electrocution on power lines and predation by domestic pets. It may also be captured for use as pets (1).,Despite being home to numerous species found nowhere else in the world only one percent of the forests of Bahia home to the blond titi monkey are under any form of protection (9). As a number of destructive activities continue to degrade the area action is urgently required to protect the blond titi monkey\xe2\x80\x99s habitat. Thankfully several organisations including the Brazilian Institute for the Environment are working to promote the study and protection of Brazil\xe2\x80\x99s threatened primates (10). Conservation International is also helping to establish a Central Biodiversity Corridor that aims to connect fragmented forests while WWF is developing an overall conservation strategy for Brazil\xe2\x80\x99s Atlantic forests (9) (11). Further research is needed into the ecology and status of this enigmatic species if it is to be pulled back from the brink of extinction (1). \xa0\xa0 ,loss;pet; ,wwf; ,2,1

Blue-knobbed curassow,Crax alberti,Blue-billed curassow (Crax alberti),Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Galliformes,Cracidae,Crax (1),Size: 83 â 93 cm (2),The blue-billed curassow has been dramatically impacted by the rapid rate of deforestation across its range due to the expansion of agriculture cattle farming mining activities logging operations and human population growth (2) (6). The loss of habitat has been so extensive that little now remains (2). Additionally this species is prized by hunters and is particularly vulnerable during the breeding season because of the conspicuous vocalisations performed by the males making them easy to locate. At this time the eggs are also taken from the nests to incubate and rear for trade and consumption (6). Sadly loss and fragmentation of habitat only serves to facilitate easier access to the bird for poachers (2).,South America\xe2\x80\x99s newest nature reserve Reserva Natural El Paujil was established in 2004 by the Colombian bird conservation NGO Fundaci\xc3\xb3n ProAves (2) (7). It is in the Serran\xc3\xada de las Quinchas the sole surviving block of Magdalena Valley Humid Forest. The reserve which is named after the local name for this species El Paujil is a major refuge for threatened <strong>endemic</strong> species and is thought to contain the most significant surviving population of the blue-billed curassow (7). Penalties have been introduced here for shooting or trapping species (2) and ProAves is planning to purchase a further 5000 ha of forest adjoining the reserve (7). Other reserves also exist such as the Bajo Cauca-Nech\xc3\xad Regional Reserve which has been recently declared and probably holds this species and the vast Paramillo National Park but no protective measures have been implemented here (2). ,loss;fragmentation; ,captive breeding;protected; ,2,2
Courtoisâs laughingthrush,Garrulax courtoisi,Blue-crowned laughingthrush (Garrulax courtoisi),Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Timaliidae,Garrulax (1),c. 50 g (3),The blue-crowned laughingthrush has an extremely small and fragmented range and its tiny wild population is thought to number only around 200 to 250 individuals. The potential <strong>subspecies</strong> <em>G. c. simaoensis</em> has not been seen in the wild for some time despite a number of searches although it is thought that individuals of this <strong>subspecies</strong> may exist in captivity (2) (7) (8).,A number of conservation efforts are now underway to protect this rare Chinese bird. Several small protected areas have been established by the local government of Wuyuan County in Jiangxi Province supported by various organisations such as Chester Zoo and WWF-China (2) (8). Education and awareness work has also been conducted in local schools (2) (10).

Indeed the species was thought to have been lost from the wild until it was rediscovered in 1992 (2). Ironically the rarity of this species makes it even more desirable for collectors and the illegal trade appears to continue to this date (3). Surviving populations are extremely fragmented and vulnerable (2). Established land management practices including burning of under-storey in palm groves also mitigate against recovery of the population (6).,The blue-throated macaw is protected by law in Bolivia (2) and international trade is prohibited by its listing on Appendix I of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) (4). Illegal trade appears to continue however and it has been recommended that full-time guards may be required to halt this process (2). Problems arise however from the fact that much of this bird\xe2\x80\x99s range is on privately owned ranches (5). Research is also needed into the natural ecology of this species so that effective management plans can be implemented (2). Fortunately there are several organisations involved with the research and conservation of this bird and a Species Recovery Plan has now been formulated. NGO Armon\xc3\xada Bolivia\xe2\x80\x99s BirdLife International partner also set up the Blue-throated Macaw Conservation Programme which they have worked on in conjunction with the Loro Parque Fundaci\xc3\xb3n to save this Critically Endangered bird. Incredibly in October 2004 this programme found a new disjunct population at Santa Rosa 100 kilometres west of previous records providing new hope that more blue-throated macaws exist in the wild than previously thought (6). The programme\xe2\x80\x99s important work on mapping the species assessing its numbers and threats in different areas will certainly help guide priority conservation decisions in the future and hopefully help bring this beautiful bird back from the brink of extinction (5). ,pet; ,cites;protected; ,1,2

Many areas are being drained dredged filled or flooded for urban development agriculture and pond and reservoir construction (4) (5). The loss and alteration of suitable habitat increases the risk of bog turtles being killed on roads and leaves them more exposed to predation (5). The impact of this habitat loss on bog turtle populations is being compounded by the illegal wildlife trade (5) as unfortunately the small size unique colouration and rarity of this turtle makes it highly valued in the pet trade (4).,Bog turtles are legally protected or regulated in nearly all states in which they occur (2) but most of these regulations relate just to the species and do not provide protection to its habitat (5). However many states are increasing efforts to conserve both bog turtles and their habitat and a number of wetland habitats containing turtle populations throughout the range are protected (5). ,loss;fragmentation;pet; ,cites;protected; ,3,2

Logging not only removes lichen substrate but also alters the microclimate of the forest a factor to which this species is particularly susceptible (4). Owing to the impacts of habitat loss and air pollution the Atlantic population has declined by more than 90 percent over the past two decades (2) (3).,The Atlantic population of the boreal felt lichen is protected in Canada under the Federal Species at Risk Act (SARA) and is the focus of an ongoing recovery strategy (2). Crucially efforts are being made through land purchases and agreements with landowners to formally protect areas of forest that are home to this rare species (2) (3). Furthermore conservationists are engaging with private and government forest managers to encourage their participation in the mapping of boreal felt lichen habitat and the implementation of management plans that will prevent further habitat loss (2). ,loss;pollution; ,protected; ,2,1

However the main threat to orangutans today is loss of habitat. In the past twenty years 80 percent of orangutan habitat has been lost to illegal logging gold mining and conversion to permanent agriculture in particular oil palm plantations. Orangutans are extremely vulnerable to exploitation largely as a result of their extremely long inter-birth interval (8).,The Bornean orangutan is protected by law in both the Malaysian and Indonesian areas of the island and is listed on Appendix I of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) which prohibits international trade (3) (7). While some populations do occur within protected parks illegal logging even within protected areas remains a key threat to the survival of this species and has increased with political instability in Indonesia (2). ,loss;pet; ,cites;protected; ,2,2

Dam-building has also flooded suitable habitat especially in Brazil and Paraguay (4) and intensifying ecotourism activities such as rafting may become another threat in the future (3). Other threats include inbreeding hunting competition forest fires egg-collecting pesticides and predation (7). Fewer than 250 birds are thought to remain in the world with the vast majority in Brazil. In Argentina where very few individuals survive and extinction may be imminent hunting and collection of exhibition specimens is believed to have contributed to the species\xe2\x80\x99 decline (4).,This extremely rare bird occurs in three Brazilian national parks and in Argentina sections of the Arroyo Uruz\xc3\xba are also protected within the Urugua\xc3\xad Provincial Park (4). Commercial diamond extraction was banned in the Serra da Canastra area in Brazil in 1996 (7). A Brazilian Merganser Recovery Team has been set up and a Brazilian Merganser action plan has been created which details priority conservation projects (8) (9). In line with these plans the Brazilian NGO Terra Brasilis has initiated a conservation program the world\xe2\x80\x99s most important site Serra da Canastra National Park in South Central Brazil (8) (9). The programme involves collecting basic information needed to adequately protect the species such as studies of its breeding ecology and an inventory of its distribution within the Canastra range as well as environmental education in both urban and rural areas (schoolchildren teachers farmers and other local people) and a campaign to market the species presence with the aim of ultimately making it a flagship species for the region (9). Nevertheless even despite these efforts there is a very real possibility of extinction in the wild becoming a reality and without being established in captivity this rare species would be lost to the world forever. ,loss;hunting;pet;pollution; ,protected; ,4,1

Historically this species was considered a pest and over three million were killed between 1880 and 1920 for bounty money (7). The introduction of predators and competitors such as foxes cats rats and rabbits combined with habitat reduction from farming and altered burning regimes have all had detrimental effects on the species (2).,The Critically Endangered brush-tailed bettong is reliant on the monitoring and reduction of fox populations as well as careful habitat management for its survival (7). Research is currently underway to identify possible new <strong>translocation</strong> sites (1) and an investigation is being carried out by the Woylie Conservation Research Project to discover why all large brush-tailed bettong populations across Australia dramatically declined in 2001. Predation disease and food availability are the main areas under investigation (1) and hopefully the findings will enable the prevention of further declines in the future. ,pet; , ,1,0

Flatback tortoise,Geochelone platynota,Burmese starred tortoise (Geochelone platynota),Animalia,Chordata,Reptilia,Testudines,Testudinidae,Geochelone (1),Carapace length: 26 cm (2),Like many turtles and tortoises of Southeast Asia the Burmese star tortoise has undergone dramatic declines due to the increasing demand in the Asian market in which it is sold for its meat and perceived medicinal value (9). Although \xe2\x80\x98subsistence\xe2\x80\x99 gathering of the species has occurred for hundreds of years by native people together with collection for its yellow-rayed <strong>carapace</strong> which is used for a container for cooking oil seeds etc. the impact was relatively small and sustainable. In recent years however subsistence has been replaced by mass commercial harvesting as the price of this species skyrocketed in the Asian markets (primarily Taiwan and China) (8). The tortoise has also been hard hit recently by the illegal international pet trade often ending up in European and North American collections (9). With their distinctive markings and dramatic colours these tortoises are attractive to collectors and their rarity makes them particularly valuable (10). Indeed adults can fetch up to US$7000 each from private collectors in the Western world (10) and this high price and demand encourages overexploitation of wild populations (5). Habitat destruction and wild fires also pose a threat to these tortoises particularly to smaller individuals (5).,The Burmese star tortoise exists in two protected areas Shwe Settaw Wildlife Sanctuary and Minzontaung Wildlife Sanctuary and an area proposed for protected status Myaleik Taung. At the Minzontaung Wildlife Sanctuary and Myaleik Taung the species is protected by local religious beliefs that deem it bad luck to collect the tortoises and commercial poaching is so far virtually non-existent. The Sanctuary is also well patrolled by guards with access strictly controlled and wild fires are managed. The Minzontaung Wildlife Sanctuary and Myaleik Taung therefore offer excellent potential for the successful conservation of the Burmese star tortoise (5). Sadly the Shwe Settaw Wildlife Sanctuary does not seem to be faring so well which has recently been reduced by around 30% due to the sale of a large tract to an agricultural development consortium. Subsistence and commercial harvest from the Sanctuary is commonplace with one village trader admitting to collecting 300 individuals in 6 months and there being at least one trader in every village. The Burmese star tortoise is fully protected by law and it is a capital offence to remove them from the wild. However the Myanmar Government reportedly ignore the capture and sale of these tortoises or are easily bribed with rampant civil war and radical guerrilla soldiers near the borders deterring police involvement there. A captive breeding programme has been set up at the Shwe Settaw Wildlife Sanctuary but hybridisation with <i>Indotestudo elongata</i> in a shared fenced area has been common. There is also evidence that this area is quickly grazed and tortoises here starve to death at an alarming rate. Stricter enforcement of protection laws is desperately needed and more effective management protocols at this Sanctuary but as long as a lucrative market exists tortoise hunting is likely to remain an attractive economic option for rural people (8). One suggestion has been to promote the significance of rural religious beliefs for the benefit of tortoise conservation in this area which has helped protect this beautiful species so effectively in the Minzontaung Wildlife Sanctuary and Myaleik Taung (5). However in a financially depressed society such as this the economic lure of such profitable natural resources may sadly win out (8). ,pet; ,protection law;captive breeding;protected; ,1,3

Indeed goats had reduced the remaining wild specimen to a small half-eaten shrub when it was first discovered. Owing to the unprecedented level of scientific interest that surrounded the little plant in the aftermath of its re-discovery local people became convinced of the plant\xe2\x80\x99s medicinal properties (2). Consequently there was a period before the erection of multiple fences (1) (2) and even the installation of a guard when people were intent on removing branches twigs and leaves from the hapless plant (7). Although the protection of the single wild specimen has now been secured the real obstacle to the species\xe2\x80\x99 long-term survival is establishing an efficient means of propagating a non-sterile population from an effectively sterile plant (2).,Relatively soon after the re-discovery of the caf\xc3\xa9 marron cuttings from the surviving plant were sent to Kew Gardens in England. At Kew scientists were successful in propagating clones of the plant from the cuttings but could not find a means of successfully fertilising the flowers in order to produce seeds (2). Then in 2003 a major breakthrough was made when researchers discovered a technique to bypass the plant\xe2\x80\x99s self-incompatibility mechanism resulting in the production of a small number of viable seeds (2) (8). Since then several seeds have been successfully germinated at a nursery on Rodrigues with the aim of eventually re-vitalising a wild population on the island (9). ,loss;invasive; , ,2,0

Although there are limits to how many groupers can be taken in each fishing trip the sheer number of fishermen (there are one million recreational licenses in Florida alone) has caused the population to continue to decline (1). As shallow water fish stocks decrease fishing is taking place in increasingly deep water in order to improve catch rates increasing the threat to the calico grouper (1).,In the eastern part of its range only one calico grouper may be taken per vessel per trip for both recreational and commercial boats; if more are taken these may not be traded or sold at sea (5). Limits for recreational and commercial boats also exist in the Gulf of Mexico (7) but unfortunately these regulations do nothing to prevent <strong>bycatch</strong> mortality. ,fishing; ,protected; ,1,1
CÃ³ndor Californiano; CÃ³ndor de California,Gymnogyps californianus,California condor (Gymnogyps californianus),Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Falconiformes,Cathartidae,Gymnogyps (1),9 kg (2),The original decline of the California condor followed the extinction of many large mammals in North America (5). Despite legal protection since 1900 (10) the 20th Century decline was due to human induced pressures such as trapping shooting egg collecting and lead poisoning following ingestion of carcasses killed with lead shot (2). Unfortunately lead poisoning still occurs regularly and remains the condor's greatest threat; other current threats include collisions with power lines shooting and both deliberate and accidental poisoning (12).,Towards the end of the 1980s with only eight individuals left in the wild it was clear that the extinction of this bird was imminent. The remaining wild individuals were taken into captivity and incorporated into an intensive conservation breeding programme run by San Diego Wild Animal Park Los Angeles Zoo and The Peregrine Fund (13). A variety of techniques were used in the breeding programme including <strong>double-clutching</strong> and the rearing of chicks with hand puppets and in 1992 the first condors were released back into the wild (14). Numerous hurdles have had to be overcome not least teaching captive birds to avoid power cables but in the spring of 2002 the first wild condor chick for two decades hatched (13). The rescue of the Californian condor is an ongoing conservation programme but the successes so far have been inspiring and the population continues to climb (8); today the condor can once again be seen soaring over the rocky Californian landscape. , , ,0,0

Animalia,Colophon primosi,Cape stag beetle (Colophon primosi),Animalia,Arthropoda,Insecta,Coleoptera,Lucanidae,Colophon (1),,Collectors appear to pose the greatest threat to this enigmatic group of beetles (4) (6). The Cape stag beetles are amongst the most highly prized beetles on the market (7) with complete sets of <i>Colophon</i> species fetching upward of $10000 and even single specimens of the rarest species being advertised at several thousand dollars (3). Four Germans have recently been caught having captured 211 of these beetles (5). Other threats include habitat damage and loss infrastructure development (such as mobile telephone masts) inappropriate fire regimes human disturbance climate change and over-collection by researchers (4). These threats are exacerbated by the small range occupied by this genus and their suspected low reproductive rate (4).,All <i>Colophon</i> species were given provincial legal protection in 1992 which served to limit legal collection internal trade and export from the province (7) (3). Their listing on Appendix III of CITES also controls import and export of the species across South Africa\xe2\x80\x99s borders (2). These laws appear to be fairly rigorously enforced with the four Germans recently caught with over 200 of these rare beetles fined almost \xc2\xa310000 (5). In 1994 it was proposed that <i>Colophon</i> beetles be upgraded to Appendix I of CITES but the proposal was ultimately withdrawn (7). The upgrade of <i>Colophon</i> beetles to Appendix I would certainly help their chances of future survival and should be seriously considered in the ongoing objective to protect these rare <strong>endemic</strong> beetles. ,loss; ,cites; ,1,1

With so few individuals remaining extinction could be imminent for this enigmatic primate especially as its habitat is highly fragmented by agricultural land. To move between forest patches the Caquet\xc3\xa1 titi monkey must cross areas of grassland intersected by barbed wire fences limiting the species\xe2\x80\x99 natural movement across the landscape and making it highly vulnerable to predation and hunting. Furthermore as none of the species\xe2\x80\x99 known range occurs in protected areas it is likely that its already reduced habitat will continue to dwindle unless major conservation measures are implemented (2). \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0,Colombia supports a number of rare primates including several <strong>endemic</strong> species yet despite its critical importance for primate conservation there is still relatively little known about many of these species. Habitat loss is the single most important threat to Colombia\xe2\x80\x99s primates and even in protected areas where law enforcement is often inadequate deforestation is increasing (5). To prevent the <strong>endemic</strong> Caquet\xc3\xa1 titi monkey from becoming extinct efforts to publicise its presence are urgently needed and measures must to be taken to afford its remaining habitat greater protection. Further surveys are also required to determine the population size range and status of this extremely rare primate (2). ,hunting; ,protected; ,1,1

Plantae,Attalea crassispatha,Carossier palm (Attalea crassispatha),Plantae,Tracheophyta,Liliopsida,Arecales,Palmae,Attalea (1),Hieght: up to 20 m (2),The conversion of habitat for agriculture has had a severe impact on <em>A. crassispatha</em> with slash and burn practices being especially unfavourable to natural regeneration (3) (4). In 1996 there were estimated to be less than 30 individuals remaining in the wild (1) (4) (5). Grazing by livestock on fruits and seedlings and a reduction in the abundance of seed dispersal agents is now limiting its ability to recover. Furthermore local people commonly harvest the immature seeds for food and cooking oil and the durable and insect resistant trunks are occasionally used in construction (3) (4) (5). Given the small size of its population <em>A. crassispatha</em> is also vulnerable to extreme natural events such as hurricanes (4) (5).,Conservation efforts for <em>A. crassispatha</em> have largely concentrated on planting palms and collecting seeds from adult plants in the wild (4). Probably the largest collection of the species is maintained at Fairchild Tropical Botanic Garden Miami Florida USA. However most of the palms in the collection are still too young to flower or fruit and of the few reproductively mature plants none have produced viable seed. As a result further research is needed to determine the possible causes of reproductive failure (5). During the 1990s numerous seedlings of <em>A. crassispatha</em> were also planted on the grounds of public buildings and private residences in Haiti in an effort to develop in-country <em>ex-situ</em> collections (4) (5). Unfortunately an assessment of the status of these seedlings is long overdue. , , ,0,0

Goats and deer ate the seedling shoots and the leaves of the tree while pigs rooting through the ground destroyed seedlings and the roots (6).,Conservation efforts began in the 1970s with a detailed inventory of the remaining Catalina mahogany plants (8). In 1999 the entire Wild Boar Gully area was fenced off enclosing 45 hectares (4). This action was successful and resulted in the numbers of seedlings and saplings increasing year after year reaching a peak of 113 individuals in 2002.

Animalia,Clarias cavernicola,Cave catfish (Clarias cavernicola),Animalia,Chordata,Actinopterygii,Siluriformes,Clariidae,Clarias (1),Length: 16.1 cm (2),The cave catfish is found only within a single cave in Namibia and is therefore at inherent risk of extinction due to any chance event. The main threat to the species comes from the depletion of ground water within the cave and the exploitation of aquifer water may pose the most serious threat in the long-term (3).,The protection of the Aigamas Cave is vital in the conservation of this species and the present owner is sympathetic to the sensitivity of the cave only allowing access or collection of the cave catfish with a Nature Conservation Permit (3). Twenty captive specimens were held in the National Zoological Gardens' aquarium in Pretoria for several years (3) but no longer persist (7).

four-coloured flowerpecker; orange-backed flowerpecker,Dicaeum quadricolor,Cebu flowerpecker (Dicaeum quadricolor),Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Dicaeidae,Dicaeum (1),Length: 11 - 12 cm (2),The island of Cebu has long been notorious for its deforestation\xa0(6). The native forests of the island were rapidly cleared as far back as the 1890s and a century later barely 0.03 percent or 15 square kilometres of the original forest cover remained\xa0(2). The rediscovery of the Cebu flowerpecker was unexpected because of the almost total loss of its habitat but what tiny forest patches do remain are still under threat from illegal settlement and logging road construction shifting cultivation firewood collection charcoal making and clearance for mining. In addition competition with the red-striped flowerpecker (<em>Dicaeum australe</em>) may have exacerbated the species\xe2\x80\x99 decline. With a population estimated at only around 100 individuals (as of 2009) and with a highly fragmented range totalling just 8 square kilometres the future of this small bird is highly uncertain\xa0(2)\xa0(3)\xa0(4) (7).,The Cebu flowerpecker has been the focus of a number of conservation efforts since its rediscovery. In 2009 it was chosen as the flagship species for the British Birdwatching Fair the largest fair of its kind in the world and the Philippines Department of Tourism has also pledged support for the species including financial support for conservation efforts by the Cebu Biodiversity Conservation Foundation\xa0(5) (8). Conservation actions for the species have so far included habitat rehabilitation attempts to control timber poaching and forest clearance the planting of corridors to link remaining forest patches and research into the flowerpecker\xe2\x80\x99s ecology. One site where the Cebu flowerpecker occurs the Nug-as Forest is managed and protected and local forest wardens regularly patrol both this and Dalaguete forest patches. A further site that may hold the species Malabuyoc is within the borders of a cement company reserve while another Mt. Lantoy has been declared a Watershed Forest Reserve\xa0(2)\xa0(4).

The <strong>colonies</strong> of Chatham Island itself are plagued by humans cattle pigs sheep cats dogs weka (<i>Gallirallus australis</i>) and brush-tailed possums (<i>Trichosurus vulpecula</i>). Disturbance is thought to cause the birds to trample on their nests; breaking the eggs before abandoning the site. Breeding sites have also been abandoned following the arrival of the fur seal (<i>Arctocephalus forsteri</i>) on Star Keys Island. Small numbers of birds are shot or caught in crayfish pots and it is thought that changes in the marine environment may have affected the availability of fish species (2).,A census of the Chatham Island shag was taken in 1997 and a follow-up was done in 2003-2004 as part of the Chatham Island Shag and Pitt Island Shag Recovery Plan that was brought into effect in 2001. It recommends that the population as a whole is surveyed every five years but that a closer eye is kept on the colonies of Chatham Island with a census each year. Authorities are hoping to come to an agreement with local land and stock owners that would enable fences to be built around breeding <strong>colonies</strong>. Dog owners need to be educated as to the effect their pets can have on the Chatham Island shag and eco-tourists must be similarly supervised. It may be necessary to gain legal protection for all colonies (2). ,environment; , ,1,0

Forests were initially cut down for timber and later to make room for the rapidly expanding cattle ranches and sugar plantations. The rate of deforestation increased dramatically in the 19<sup>th</sup>and 20<sup>th</sup>centuries due to rapid population and economic growth and an increased demand for charcoal and firewood. The legacy of such a destructive history is that tragically today less than 10 percent of the Atlantic forest remains. Consequently many of the species within this region are seriously threatened with extinction (6) (7). One such species the cherry-throated tanager now has a critically small population probably no more than 250 individuals and a very patchy distribution (2). The future of this rare species is threatened by further loss to what little habitat remains through urban and agricultural encroachment and timber extraction (4) (8).,The survival of the Critically Endangered cherry-throated tanager is perilously bound to the future management of two privately owned forests in which the last remaining populations are found (2) (3) (4). Thankfully however since 2004 SAVE Brasil has been working with the government and local organisations and communities to ensure the conservation of the forests on which the cherry-throated tanager depends to survive. As a result of these efforts in June 2010 the government of the state of Esp\xc3\xadrito Santo created ten Ecological Corridors including the Cherry-throated Tanager Corridor which are recognised as\xa0crucial areas for the state\xe2\x80\x99s biodiversity.

It is thought that habitat loss through the planting of plantations and residential development may have had some impact whilst climate change and possibly disease might have caused declines in existing areas of suitable habitat (1) (3).,Urgent survey work is vital to determine whether the Chile Darwin\xe2\x80\x99s frog still survives. In addition suitable habitat for this species needs to be surveyed to determine whether amphibian pathogens such as the chytrid fungus (not previously reported in Chile) are present in the area.

Alligator De Chine,Alligator sinensis,Chinese alligator (Alligator sinensis),Animalia,Chordata,Reptilia,Crocodylia,Alligatoridae,Alligator (1),up to 40 kg (2),A survey by the Wildlife Conservation Society in 1999 found the wild population of Chinese alligators to be worryingly low: at 130 to 150 individuals (2). Habitat destruction has been the major cause of this decline and wetland areas continue to be modified for agriculture in an effort to cope with the intense human population pressure in the region (4). A highly secretive species spending a long period of time (6 to 7 months) below ground in burrows the Chinese alligator now primarily exists in populated areas where it inevitably comes into conflict with local farmers. Burrow systems cause drainage problems for fields and alligators also consume ducks owned by farmers (2). Despite a lack of commercial value for the Chinese alligator's skin on the international market these reptiles are often killed when encountered either through fear or due to a threat to livelihood (2).,In contrast to the decimated wild population the breeding of captive Chinese alligators has been very successful and the captive population currently exceeds 10000 individuals (2). The Anhui Research Centre of Chinese Alligator Reproduction (ARCCAR) was established in 1979 and houses captive-bred alligators within 26 small protected reserves (2). Any wild populations that remain are severely fragmented and almost none exist in their natural habitat (2). However the Chinese government has recently allocated funds to create new habitats with a view to introduce captive-bred alligators into the wild in three other provinces (2). This encouraging step needs the support of local people to make it a success; they will need to be convinced of the worth of living together with this ancient species that may have been associated with the mythical Chinese dragon. , ,protected; ,0,1
Chinese crested-tern; Chinese-crested tern; Matsu tern,Sterna bernsteini,Chinese crested tern (Sterna bernsteini),Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Charadriiformes,Laridae,Sterna (1),Length: 42 cm (2),The specific threats facing this exceptionally rare bird have not yet been identified but a range of environmental issues are known to affect other species within its range and are therefore highly plausible threats to the Chinese crested tern (4). Offshore islets which appear to be the key nesting areas of this species are thought to be relatively safe from human disturbance. However other coastal wetlands in the Chinese crested tern\xe2\x80\x99s presumed breeding range in eastern China have been affected by large-scale development projects (4) (6). Seabirds are also hunted and exploited for food in China. Indeed the main threat to the newly discovered population on the Mazu Dao islands is from fishermen from mainland China who visit the nesting islets to collect seashells and bird eggs. Other potential threats include the introduction of rats and cats to currently predator-free offshore islands oil pollution and contamination of estuarine areas by industrial and agricultural pollutants and human disturbance (6).,The Mazu Dao islands were declared as the National Matzu Nature Reserve for Terns in 2000 offering some protection to the birds there (4) (6). The most recent sighting of the Chinese crested tern in China was from Huanghe Sanjiaozhou Nature Reserve in Shandong in 1991 and several other protected areas exist along the Chinese coast where this species may occur (4). The Chinese crested tern is nationally protected in China and Thailand and the area where it was once recorded in Thailand is protected as the Laem Talumphuk Non-Hunting Area (4) (6). Further studies are certainly needed to better understand this species including its range what sort of breeding success it is having the exact threats it faces and its protection needs (7). One suggested measure which has been successful elsewhere is to give local people a vested interest in seeing the terns remain alive perhaps by allowing or encouraging fishermen to take birdwatchers to see the rare seabirds rather than collecting their eggs (7). Thus special boat trips have now been made available from Matsu Island to the National Matsu Nature Reserve for Terns during the months of June and July for NT$350 (approx. US$11). Landing on the nesting island is not permitted and viewing is from the boat at a safe distance so that the terns are not disturbed but this revenue may help protect the Chinese crested tern by making it more valuable alive than dead (5). ,environmental;environment;pollution; ,protected; ,3,1
Chinese salamander,Andrias davidianus,Chinese giant salamander (Andrias davidianus),Animalia,Chordata,Amphibia,Caudata,Cryptobranchidae,Andrias (1),Length: 1.8 m (2),The Chinese giant salamander is threatened by hunting as its flesh is considered a delicacy in Asia. Other threats include habitat alteration and loss; deforestation causes soil erosion and increased runoff and silting in rivers. The building of dams in China over the years has also changed the natural river flow in some areas where the Chinese giant salamander is found. Local pesticides fertilizers and pollutants are also thought to affect the health of this amphibian though little research has been conducted. Symptoms of these recent threats include the lower numbers of Chinese giant salamanders recorded with smaller populations and also smaller individuals (4).,The Chinese giant salamander is now protected from international trade by its listing on Appendix I of the Convention of International Trade of Endangered Species (CITES) (3). Since the 1980s 14 nature reserves with a total area of more than 355000 hectares have been established for the conservation of the Chinese giant salamander (7). This includes a huge 99975 hectare area of Mount Wuyi China which was designated as a World Heritage Site in 1999 dedicated to conserving this biodiverse region including the habitat of this salamander (8). The surrounding area has a growing population and the establishment of this reserve will protect many species. However there are still concerns that development around the reserve and tourism plans within the reserve will place pressure on Mount Wuyi\xe2\x80\x99s rich resources healthy rivers and habitats. Conservation efforts to protect this habitat and other areas where the ancient Chinese giant salamander is found are essential for the survival of this species and many others (8). ,loss;hunting; ,cites;protected; ,2,2

Pangolin Ã Queue Courte; Pangolin De Chine,Manis pentadactyla,Chinese pangolin (Manis pentadactyla),Animalia,Chordata,Mammalia,Pholidota,Manidae,Manis (1),2 â 7 kg (2),Due to its solitary and <strong>nocturnal</strong> nature this species is rarely observed and therefore little information exists on its status; however the population is believed to be declining (1). The Chinese pangolin has been intensively hunted for its meat which is considered a delicacy as well as for its skin and scales which have been used to scratch mosquito bites due to their supposed antiseptic properties or ground into a powder which is believed to have aphrodisiac properties and an ability to cure for skin diseases (4) (6). Due to it being more terrestrial than other Asian pangolin species it has been easier to hunt and is now very rare in some countries of its range such as Vietnam and Lao PDR (1). Hunting is the main threat to the Chinese pangolin as disturbance of its habitat has not been shown to have a large impact provided its food source of termites and ants are not lost (1). \xa0,The Chinese pangolin is legally protected in the majority of countries it resides in including Bangladesh China Taiwan Thailand and India. It also occurs in some protected areas but unfortunately these measures have not been sufficient in reducing the illegal hunting and trade that takes place (1). While large seizures of illegally caught Chinese pangolins do occur greater enforcement of laws and improved management of protected areas are required to prevent this devastating hunting (1). ,hunting;disease; ,protected; ,2,1

Asian three-striped box turtle; golden coin turtle,Cuora trifasciata,Chinese three-striped box turtle (Cuora trifasciata),Animalia,Chordata,Reptilia,Testudines,Bataguridae,Cuora (1),Carapace length: up to 20 cm (2),Turtles and tortoises across Southeast Asia have undergone massive declines in recent years due to overexploitation for the Southern Asian particularly Chinese food markets (9). Although having been hunted by local people for subsistence for centuries recent changes in Asian economics have opened up direct access to foreign markets in which turtles and tortoises are favoured for their meat and perceived medicinal value (10). The Chinese three-striped box turtle has suffered particularly badly because of recent claims that its <strong>plastron</strong> contains medicinal properties that can cure cancer which has driven up the demand and therefore price bringing this species to the edge of extinction (2). Additionally this rare turtle is highly sought after by the pet trade with adults fetching up to US$3000 each (6) (9). Such a high market value inevitably leads to over-collection from the wild. Indeed some Chinese can attain enough money to build a house from the sale of a single adult Chinese three-striped box turtle an extremely powerful incentive (6).,In 2001 a programme on the conservation of wild fauna and flora and the establishment of nature reserves was begun in China. Many new nature reserves have been created some of which offer habitat for tortoises and freshwater turtles (11). This species is protected by law in Hong Kong under the Wild Animals Protection Ordinance Cap. 170. under which collection of any wild turtles is prohibited unless under a special permit obtained from the Agricultural Fisheries and Conservation Department (7). Individuals employed by the Agricultural Fisheries and Conservation Department of Hong Kong also patrol protected territories to curb illegal hunting of native tortoises and freshwater turtles (11). Various captive breeding programmes for this species exist around the world (12) but this Department is also implementing a captive breeding project with a local conservation organisation that includes plans for subsequent reintroductions into the wild (11). ,pet; ,captive breeding;protected; ,1,2

Andrew's or Christmas Island frigatebird,Fregata andrewsi,Christmas frigatebird (Fregata andrewsi),Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Pelecaniformes,Fregatidae,Fregata (1),Length: 89 - 100 cm (2),Habitat destruction and human predation have been the major causes of population decline in the past (6); dust pollution from phosphate mine driers caused one major nesting site to be abandoned (4). Dust suppression equipment has since been installed and human predation has ceased since this species has been protected (4). Birds that have been displaced in the past may now be using sub-optimal habitat which could pose a threat to their survival (4). The Christmas frigatebird is confined to a few breeding <strong>colonies</strong> on a single island and this together with their low reproductive rate (4) makes the population alarmingly vulnerable to any chance event.,Christmas Island National Park was established in 1989 and contains two of the three current breeding populations of this species\xa0(5). Christmas frigatebirds are also protected outside of the park and by Migratory Bird Agreements between Australia and other countries (4). This species remains highly vulnerable however and the close monitoring of breeding success and population size remains a high priority (4). ,pollution; ,protected; ,1,1

Plantae,Widdringtonia cedarbergensis,Clanwilliam cedar (Widdringtonia cedarbergensis),Plantae,Tracheophyta,Coniferopsida,Coniferales,Cupressaceae,Widdringtonia (1),Height: up to 25 metres (3),At the time of European settlement of South Africa the Clanwilliam cedar became massively logged in order to produce furniture telegraph poles and other structures (8). Vast tracts of the ancient forest have been lost. Today high-intensity fires represent the biggest threat to survival and groves of dead sliver trees ravaged by fire stand out starkly against the landscape (6). In early 2002 large bush fires destroyed around 200 hectares of a cedar plantation (8).,Logging of the Clanwilliam cedar was banned at the turn of the 20th Century but under various pressures such as fire the population has not shown any signs of recovery (6). A concerted conservation programme to save this ancient giant is now in place and a 5252-hectare area has been set aside as a Cedar Reserve (6). Within the reserve fires are managed and controlled in order to prevent high-intensity summer fires from sweeping through the area. Seedlings are also grown in order to be replanted and thus help the struggling population to recover. It is hoped that focussing on such a charismatic species will also benefit other members of this unique South African habitat (6). , , ,0,0

Coelacanthe,Latimeria chalumnae,Coelacanth (Latimeria chalumnae),Animalia,Chordata,Sarcopterygii,Coelacanthiformes,Latimeriidae,Latimeria (1),up to 90 kg (2),Population numbers are particularly difficult to assess given the deep habitats of the coelacanth but the Comoros population was believed to show a dramatic decline in the 1990s (6). These fish are accidentally caught on lines whilst local fisherman search the deep waters for other species (6). Due to the likely slow reproduction rate and small number of offspring of coelacanths the species is possibly particularly vulnerable to the removal of pregnant females from the population (6).,The coelacanth is protected from international trade by its listing on Appendix I of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) (1). Fishermen of the Grand Comoro Island have also imposed a voluntary ban on fishing in areas where coelacanths (or \xe2\x80\x98gombessa\xe2\x80\x99 as they are known locally) exist (5) in a vital effort to save their country\xe2\x80\x99s most unique fauna. The Coelacanth Rescue Mission is also distributing Deep Release Kits to local fishermen which provide an effective method of returning accidentally caught fish to their deep habitat (3). There have recently been encouraging signs that the Comoros population is now stable (5) although careful monitoring will be needed to ensure this living fossil survives into the next millennium. , ,cites;protected; ,0,2

The construction of communication towers on Cerro de Punta is thought to have destroyed a large part of the original population with further development and construction activities being cited as the main threat to the remaining plants (1) (3). The highly restricted range of Cook\xe2\x80\x99s holly also makes it extremely vulnerable to natural disturbances such as landslides and hurricanes (2).,Cook\xe2\x80\x99s holly was listed on the US Endangered Species Act in 1987 and a Recovery Plan was drawn up by the US Fish and Wildlife Service in 1991 (1) (2). Several necessary actions were outlined in the plan including: the protection and monitoring of existing populations; the undertaking of research into the species\xe2\x80\x99 life history and reproductive biology; and the propagation of seedlings for the enhancement of existing populations and the establishment of new ones (2). However since none of these measures appear to have been implemented thus far (5) an up-to-date evaluation of the condition of the remaining plants seems to be seriously overdue. , ,endangered species act; ,0,1

Animalia,Pseudophryne corroboree,Corroboree frog (Pseudophryne corroboree),Animalia,Chordata,Amphibia,Anura,Myobatrachidae,Pseudophryne (1),Length: 2.5 - 3 cm (2),There has been a recent decline in this previously abundant species which has now been lost from as much as 68% of its former range (5). The unusual life cycle of the corroboree frog makes it particularly vulnerable; only one small clutch is laid in a year and tadpoles have a long development time (4). The precise causes of this sudden decline are unclear but a number of factors may be involved including habitat destruction by ski resort development and trampling by humans and livestock (6). However it is now widely accepted that chytrid fungus is a major (if not the primary) cause of their continuous decline (9).,A Recovery Plan for the corroboree frog has been published by the National Parks and Wildlife Service of New South Wales (5). This plan identifies the urgent need for more population data and investigation into the cause of the continuing decline in numbers. Research into captive breeding techniques will also be undertaken (5). In the short term the plan aims to halt the precipitous decline of this species and then work to restore this colourful frog to much of its former range (5). , ,captive breeding; ,0,1

It has already lost most of its habitat through forest clearing for timber charcoal human settlement agricultural land and industry (3). The forest areas in which it now exists are so fragmented it is believed that they are too small to maintain the tamarin populations (3). Sadly the continuous expansion of human settlement in northern Colombia has brought the cotton-headed tamarin more bad luck. With easier access to the tamarin\xe2\x80\x99s habitat animal collectors trap these small monkeys and sell them in port cities either for export or local trade (10). Populations in the past have also suffered from the export of significant numbers for biomedical research in the 1960s and 1970s (5) (9).,The cotton-headed tamarin has been\xa0protected in Colombia since 1969 and export of this species has been banned since 1974 (1).\xa0However its numbers have continued to dwindle away as has its habitat and hope of survival. If this species is to survive it is essential that immediate conservation measures are implemented (3) (8). , ,protected; ,0,1

After another hurricane in 1995 no thrashers were found in annual surveys until an individual was discovered in 2004 (2). The devastating effect of hurricanes remains a primary threat to any remaining small population. However it is believed other threats must have contributed to the decline of this species as it is likely to have survived hurricanes for millions of years. Introduced predators especially boas which were released onto the island in 1971 may have had a significant impact on Cozumel thrashers (4). Whilst large areas of forest remain on Cozumel Island the ubiquitous threat of human development and associated habitat loss and degradation is likely to increase pressures on this critically endangered species (3) (4).,Research is currently underway on the Cozumel thrasher in a project funded by the American Bird Conservancy and Conservation International (4). Surveys are urgently needed to determine whether this species still persists and an investigation into its ecology would provide further explanation for its decline and help identify suitable conservation actions (2) (5). The Cozumel thrasher is at great risk of imminent extinction but hopefully there is still the chance to pull it back from the brink. ,loss; , ,1,0

Its habitat is also threatened by human settlement land clearing for agriculture and logging. While this is a problem in many areas worldwide Sulawesi is particularly sensitive as it is an island and therefore has a limited amount of land for its wildlife and expanding human population (4).,International trade in this species is prohibited by its listing on Appendix II of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) (3). Hunting on the island however is harder to regulate. This macaque is found in three areas on the island where hunting logging and clearing is illegal. However it is not clear how effective these regulations are (4). Captive breeding of this species has been successful at Jersey Zoo and a number of other zoos and individuals may be reintroduced into the wild in the future. If this species is to survive it is essential to address the problems of hunting and habitat loss on Sulawesi (5). ,hunting; ,cites;captive breeding; ,1,2

Threats facing this species are not fully understood but are thought to include predation by introduced hedgehogs (<i>Erinaceus europaeus</i>). The little owl (<i>Athene noctua</i>) is also known to predate upon this species (3). Habitat alteration is also likely to be a problem (2). At the present time large areas of apparently suitable habitat are not occupied by this beetle. It is imperative that the reasons for its present distribution and the factors limiting the population are understood (3).,The site supporting this species has been fully protected since it became a nature reserve in 1983. Research and monitoring of the Cromwell chafer populations are on-going and current work is focusing on the predation risk posed by hedgehogs and other predators potential competitors and understanding the life history of the species (3). Hopes are that the knowledge gained from these studies will help to develop and guide the effective conservation of this unique and very rare beetle. , ,protected; ,0,1

Habitat destruction continues to encroach on the marshes where this species is found and competition with introduced and <strong>hybrid</strong> species poses further threats to survival (5).,Recent reports indicated that population numbers of the Cuban crocodile are showing signs of recovery; the population in the Zapata swamp is estimated at between 3000 and 6000 individuals (6). Active measures are underway to ensure this population remains well protected but a further important conservation priority is the establishment of an alternative wild population (5). In the 1950s to 60s thousands of Cuban crocodiles were taken into captivity to be farmed for their skins and the population of captive animals is today substantial one farm has recently been given CITES (Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species) approval to trade internationally (6). ,pet; ,cites;protected; ,1,2

Cumberland bean; Purple bean,Villosa trabalis,Cumberland bean pearly mussel (Villosa trabalis),Animalia,Mollusca,Bivalvia,Unionoida,Unionidae,Villosa (1),Length: up to 5.5 cm (2),Historically the Cumberland bean pearly mussel inhabited ten river systems but now occupies only four (3). Unfortunately like many other species of mussel the Cumberland bean pearly mussel is under threat due to human activities namely siltation channelization and water pollution such as from toxic chemical spills and run-off from urban and agricultural areas (8). Being a filter feeder the Cumberland bean pearly mussel must have exceptionally clean water to feed reproduce and respire thus any pollution or siltation seriously jeopardises the mussel\xe2\x80\x99s chance of survival as the water becomes dirty or poisonous. In addition channelization destroys suitable river habitats changing the dynamics of the water downstream so that it is no longer suitable for the mussel (2). Population numbers are hard to estimate as little data are available; however it is thought that there are around 1000 to 2000 individuals left in the wild meaning that this species has suffered a decline of around 75 to 90 percent since it was first discovered (4).,This species was first listed as Endangered by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service in June 1976 and a conservation plan was approved in August 1984. The aims of the recovery plan are to re-establish the Cumberland bean pearly mussel within two river systems that were formerly part of its range and to prevent the loss or degradation of existing habitats (4) (8). It is essential for more research to be carried out on the life history of this mysterious mussel including studies to identify the host fish species of the <strong>larvae</strong> to understand how to rear the species in a laboratory to aid with reintroduction and to identify potential habitats for reintroduction (4). ,pollution; , ,1,0

Although its modern scarcity is at least partly attributable to habitat loss and the unscrupulous activities of collectors this species is thought to have already been naturally rare long before humans had a significant impact on its environment (2) (4) (5).,Although E. latifrons is scarce in the wild numerous specimens are known to occur in public and private collections (4). Fortunately owing to its listing on Appendix I of CITES all trade in this species is prohibited unless under exceptional circumstances (3). In an effort to increase the number of individuals occurring in the wild a propagation project is being developed with the cooperation of commercial farmers in the Eastern Cape province of South Africa. The aim is to set up a seed nursery for E. latifrons using seed collected from wild pants that have been artificially pollinated (4). ,loss;environment; ,cites; ,2,1

The development of this new power station will almost certainly result in the elevation of this cycad\xe2\x80\x99s Red List status as a large proportion of the population will be wiped out\xa0(4). The activities of local communities pose an additional threat with seasonal fires and deliberate felling being particularly problematic (10).,<em>Encephalartos whitelockii </em>is partially protected by its listing on Appendix I of CITES which permits international trade in this species only under exceptional circumstances (3). In addition part of the <em>E. whitelockii</em> population occurs within the boundary of the Queen Elizabeth National Park although the integrity of some of Uganda\xe2\x80\x99 protected areas is a moot point\xa0(4). Owing to the increased pressure on <em>E. whitelockii</em> a local community-based conservation project is fortunately being implemented in the region. The project is aiming to raise community awareness on the conservation and importance of the species as well as to create a seed bank and nursery. The propagation of <em>E. whitelockii</em> in a nursery will provide plants for replanting in the wild to bolster the population\xa0(10). With the population under as serious threat as it is projects like this may be critical to this species survival. , ,cites;protected; ,0,2

Now additional threat comes from habitat loss due to <strong>desertification</strong> as well as overgrazing by livestock and the loss of tree cover following clearance by man (13) (12). The livestock not only cause drier land but also drive the gazelle away. Civil unrest in several of the countries home to this once numerous gazelle has also contributed to its decline (12).,The range of the dama gazelle falls on some of the poorest countries in Africa and consequently little action is being taken to conserve this species. It is managed in captivity and exists in a few reserves in its range but they are not well guarded and offer little more protection than any other area (14). ,loss;hunting; , ,2,0

The greatest threat to this species\xe2\x80\x99 survival on the mainland is probably the presence of unleashed dogs in Nahuelbuta National Park which may attack the foxes and also have the potential to transmit diseases. Despite dogs being prohibited from the park they are often allowed in with visitors and subsequently let loose (1). Many foxes have become habituated to humans through unrestricted feeding by visitors and spend much of their time under vehicles in the car park where they are at risk of being killed by visitors\xe2\x80\x99 cars (2). The larger island population appears relatively safer with Chilo\xc3\xa9 National Park encompassing most of the still untouched rainforest of the island and containing a sizeable fox population. However surrounding areas also containing foxes are suffering from ongoing logging forest fragmentation and poaching by locals (1). Some foxes have been persecuted by farmers on the island for killing their poultry and attacks from dogs also pose a threat here (2).,Darwin\xe2\x80\x99s fox has been protected by Chilean law since 1929 but enforcement can be difficult and some poaching unfortunately continues (1). Research and monitoring of this species is ongoing being undertaken by initiatives such as Darwin\xe2\x80\x99s Fox Research and Conservation Project which also seeks to raise awareness amongst schools dog owners farmers and loggers of the plight of the fox and the dangers that imperil it (5). The 430 square kilometre Chilo\xc3\xa9 National Park protects much of the island population and the smaller 68 square kilometre Nahuelbuta National Park protects the mainland population. However a number of foxes at Nahuelbuta are known to move to lower unprotected areas during the winter in search of milder conditions where they become more vulnerable to mortality. It has therefore been recommended that the park be expanded to protect the foxes that use these areas (1). However it is also essential that Park wardens become stricter about enforcing Park rules. Dogs brought in by visitors pose a serious threat whilst continuous feeding of the foxes has habituated them to humans and thereby made them ever more vulnerable to the dangers people bring. Indeed it has been suggested that if current relaxed attitudes continue in Nahuelbuta National Park Chilo\xc3\xa9 National Park may become the only long-term safe area for this rare <strong>endemic</strong> fox (2). ,fragmentation;poaching;disease; ,protected; ,3,1

Antanosy day gecko,Phelsuma antanosy,Day gecko (Phelsuma antanosy),Animalia,Chordata,Reptilia,Squamata,Gekkonidae,Phelsuma (1),Snout-vent length: 3.3 - 4.8 cm (2),Occupying an area thought to be no more than nine square kilometres the day gecko is threatened by further loss of its habitat. This extremely rare gecko has a highly fragmented distribution making it vulnerable to any detrimental activities within what little habitat remains (1). One small population is likely to be lost within the next 25 years as mining activity is planned in part of Sainte Luce while many other populations are under continual threat from local communities exploiting the forest\xe2\x80\x99s resources (1). Indeed the day gecko is suspected to have become extinct in Petriky Forest due to tree felling for timber fuel and conversion to agricultural land (2). This highly specialised species is also threatened by the selective removal of <em>Pandus</em> trees (1).\xa0,The Ambatotsirongorongo Forest which supports a large proportion of the remaining day gecko population is encompassed by a newly created protected area. Five forest fragments at Sainte Luce in which the day gecko is also found are also managed within a community resource use agreement which aims to protect the local people\xe2\x80\x99s livelihoods whilst conserving biodiversity (1). However the successful management of these areas will very much depend on the support of the local people and the abandonment of destructive activities such as slash-and-burn agriculture and hunting (7). Fortunately for the day gecko <em>Phelsuma </em>\xa0species breed well in captivity and the initiation of a captive-breeding programme for this gecko may well safeguard it from extinction (2).\xa0 ,loss;pet; ,protected; ,2,1

During the 1990s when Vietnam opened itself up to the international community and the Chinese economy started to boom traders and poachers moved in to utilise Vietnam\xe2\x80\x99s biodiversity (4). Poachers killed this langur not only for meat but also for bones organs and tissues that are used in traditional medicines (8). Hunting has reduced in recent years with increasing legal protection but continues to pose a significant threat. Habitat loss is also a danger to this species with the World Conservation Monitoring Centre of the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP-WCMC) estimating that a total of 30000 hectares of forest are destroyed each year in Vietnam (4). The clearing of forests to accommodate human commercial and residential growth continues to separate the remaining populations of Delacour\xe2\x80\x99s langur which are now at risk of becoming too small to be viably sustainable (2). Sixty percent of Delacour\xe2\x80\x99s langurs occur in isolated populations of fewer than 20 individuals. The loss of these sub-populations and consequently 60 percent of the whole population is feared likely in the near future without management strict regulations and law enforcement (5).,Four areas where Delacour\xe2\x80\x99s langurs are protected include: Cuc Phuong National Park Pu Luong Nature Reserve Hoa Lu Cultural and Historical Site and the recently-established Van Long Nature Reserve which is believed to contain the largest remaining population of around 70 individuals (5) (8). Unfortunately protected areas often suffer more from poaching than unprotected areas because their dense population of wildlife is seen as more profitable (2). Thus conservation groups are working to increase the level of protection and law enforcement within these protected areas. The Van Long Nature Reserve is now well guarded by rangers largely funded by the Frankfurt Zoological Society. The Pu Luong Nature Reserve also employs a large number of rangers which are helping to save the small remaining populations (8). These are encouraging steps towards helping the survival of Delacour\xe2\x80\x99s langur listed as one of the 25 most endangered primates in the world (8). Recent commitments by the Vietnamese government and several international conservation organisations to do more to protect Delacour\xe2\x80\x99s langur have greatly increased the chances of saving this rare and remarkable species (2). ,loss;hunting;environment; ,protected; ,3,1

Animalia,Elaphrus viridis,Delta green ground beetle (Elaphrus viridis),Animalia,Arthropoda,Insecta,Coleoptera,Carabidae,Elaphrus (1),Length: 6 mm (2).,The historical distribution of the delta ground beetle is unknown but it is thought reasonable to assume that the species was once found throughout the wetlands and grasslands of California\xe2\x80\x99s Central Valley (4). The area has suffered widespread disruption and destruction of its wetland habitat from agricultural development tapping of vernal pools for irrigation of crops river channelisation and encroaching urban development all of which are thought to have played a role in the demise of this species (2) (4). Additionally an introduced alien plant garden lippia (<i>Phyla</i> spp.) poses an immediate threat to the species\xe2\x80\x99 remaining range. The plant forms dense mats in vernal pools crowding out native vegetation and hindering the beetle\xe2\x80\x99s foraging (2). Only around 75 individuals have been seen since 1974 and the species\xe2\x80\x99 small range places it in very serious danger of extinction (4).,The delta green ground beetle is protected by the Lacey Act which prohibits its import export transport sale purchase receipt or acquisition (4). The beetle is also protected through its occurrence in the Jepson Prairie Reserve (5) but other suitable sites nearby are on private land and negotiations over their protection are ongoing (2). Since its life cycle is intricately intertwined with the seasonal changes of its vernal pool habitat conservation of the delta green ground beetle very much depends upon the protection of this habitat which is itself endangered (2). Thus protection of this disappearing habitat must be the top priority in the conservation of not only the delta ground beetle but also the array of other endangered species that are unique to and depend heavily upon this threatened vernal pool ecosystem. , ,protected; ,0,1

Furthermore\xa0the Dlinza pinwheels'\xa0very limited distribution means that it is highly vulnerable to the damaging effects of extreme <strong>stochastic</strong> weather conditions and climate change (1).,The fact that Dlinza Forest is an officially protected area supported by an enthusiastic local community does confer a degree of protection to the Critically Endangered Dlinza pinwheel. Nevertheless the small and exposed nature of its home means that this rare and fascinating snail remains somewhat helpless to the changing world around it (1).

This not only allows the species to be studied in greater depth but also serves as a buffer against total extinction. Indeed it is feared that these relics of an earlier stage of evolution may disappear from the wild completely in less than a decade (6). ,loss; , ,1,0

While today large-scale clearance for plantations has mostly stopped (2) (5) forest clearance for small farms continues and there is also the possibility that exploitation of <strong>primary forest</strong> for timber and firewood will increase dramatically in the future (5). In addition this species is severely affected by hunting and predation from introduced mammals such as the mona monkey (<i>Cercopithecus mona</i>) African civet (<i>Civettictis civetta</i>) and weasel (<i>Mustela nivalis</i>) (2). With its population estimated in 2007 to be between 50 and 249 individuals the combined effects of these threats are rapidly pushing the dwarf olive ibis towards extinction (2).,There are currently no conservation measures in place for the dwarf olive ibis. While various organisations have proposed that this species and its habitat should be given protected status this has yet to occur (2) (6).

The biggest threats to Grauer\xe2\x80\x99s gorillas result from armed conflict in and around the parks. In the past decade many Grauer\xe2\x80\x99s gorillas have been shot dead in crossfire or for food by people hiding in the forest. Ongoing instability in the region means that this problem is getting worse as civil war has made arms more accessible and continues to create large numbers of refugees (7). A relatively new threat to the gorillas comes from the tourism. While tourism has so far aided its survival large numbers of people coming into close contact with gorillas may put them at risk from human diseases (7).,The mountain gorilla occurs mainly within national parks and in some areas is protected by armed guards to prevent poaching (7). Gorillas in the Virunga region have been studied and protected for many decades and are now seen as an important source of tourist revenue (8). The United Nations Environmental Programme (UNEP) has recognised the urgent need to protect our closest relatives and has established a Great Ape Survival Project (GRASP).

It has been recorded from a few protected areas (1) and is listed on Appendix II of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) which means that any international trade in this species should be carefully monitored (3). Further measures are certainly needed such as hunting regulations and field studies to identify areas in which this species occurs for which protection is critical (1).\xa0\xa0 ,loss;hunting; ,cites;protected; ,2,2

Gennaeus edwardsi; Hierophasis edwardsi,Lophura edwardsi,Edwardsâs pheasant (Lophura edwardsi),Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Galliformes,Phasianidae,Lophura (1),Length: 58 - 65 cm (2)Male tail length: 24 - 26 cm (2)Female tail length: 20 - 22 cm (2),Widespread and relentless destruction of Edwards\xe2\x80\x99s pheasant\xe2\x80\x99s habitat has left this species teetering on the brink of extinction its perilous position exacerbated by hunting pressure (6). Vietnam\xe2\x80\x99s lowland <strong>primary forest</strong> has now almost been completely stripped away as a result of herbicide spraying during the Vietnam War and more recently by commercial logging and clearance for agriculture (5) (6). The last remaining forests known to support this pheasant are becoming progressively degraded by wood-cutters (6) and are vulnerable to commercial logging firewood collection charcoal production and the continued clearance of land for cultivation (7). It is thought that the completion of the Ho Chi Minh National Highway which bisects the three provinces in which the species is known to occur will only serve to increase the levels of disturbance. Hunting for food poses an additional threat and this pheasant is likely to be affected by indiscriminate snaring (6).,The areas in which there are recent records for Edwards\xe2\x80\x99s pheasant have been incorporated into two recently established nature reserves Phong Dien and Dakrong which are likely to be the last refuges for the species (6) (9). Bach Ma National Park lies within the historical range of this species and a poster campaign to obtain local information was conducted there in 1996 and 1997 but as yet there have been no confirmed records from this park. In December 2003 the captive population numbered 1033 individuals (6). A studbook was first developed in the 1960s and abandoned in the 1970s owing to lack of resources but efforts were renewed in the 1990s (7) and an international studbook now helps coordinate breeding to ensure that the captive population stays genetically healthy (5). Although there have been problems with <strong>inbreeding</strong> and <strong>hybridisation</strong> in captivity screening is thankfully helping eliminate hybrids from much of the captive stock (6). Having long been thought extinct (5) Edwards\xe2\x80\x99s pheasant now clings to a precarious existence and it is imperative that the rampant deforestation is stopped and conservation efforts kept up if this rare pheasant is to be saved from the very real possibility of extinction it now faces (6). ,hunting; , ,1,0
Kleinmannâs tortoise; Leithâs tortoise,Testudo kleinmanni,Egyptian tortoise (Testudo kleinmanni),Animalia,Chordata,Reptilia,Testudines,Testudinidae,Testudo (1),Carapace length: 14.4 cm (2),The main threats endangering the Egyptian tortoise are intensive commercial collection and habitat destruction leading to the disappearance of the species from much of its former range (8). Agricultural expansion cultivation overgrazing and urban encroachment have put enormous pressure on the Egyptian tortoise\xe2\x80\x99s fragile and dwindling habitat dramatically reducing available vegetation for food and cover (1) (8). Additionally the species has suffered heavily in Egypt from collection for the national and international pet trade which moved its attention to Libyan stock after Egyptian subpopulations were harvested to extinction. Trade in this species also exists in Libya itself which is a major concern for the future of the remaining world population (1).,The Egyptian tortoise is protected by law in Egypt but not in Libya. Additionally the tortoise is listed under Appendix I of CITES prohibiting international trade in the species. However these protective laws are evidently often flouted. Protected areas exist in Egypt including the one in which the two individuals were found in 2001 but there is little benefit of this protection or indeed motivation to establish new protected areas for the species since it is effectively extinct in Egypt. This tortoise may also occur in Kouf National Park in northeast Libya where one specimen was found 20 years ago but no other reserves exist in the species\xe2\x80\x99 known range. The establishment of more protected areas in Libya would be of enormous benefit to the Egyptian tortoise and greatly enhance its chances of survival. Although tracts of suitable habitat still remain in Libya there is an all too realistic possibility that the Egyptian tortoise could face extinction in less than 20 years if habitat degradation and trade cannot be stopped (1). ,pet; ,cites;protected; ,1,2

Animalia,Acropora palmata,Elkhorn coral (Acropora palmata),Animalia,Cnidaria,Anthozoa,Scleractinia,Acroporidae,Acropora (1),,Staghorn corals face the many threats that are impacting coral reefs globally. At present around one third of the world's reef-building corals are threatened with extinction. The principal threat to corals is the rise in sea temperature associated with global climate change. This leads to coral bleaching where the symbiotic algae are expelled leaving the corals weak and vulnerable to an increasing variety of harmful diseases. Climate change is also expected cause more extreme weather incidents and to increase ocean acidification which impairs the coral's ability to form a skeleton. These global threats are compounded by localised threats from pollution destructive fishing practices invasive species and human development (6).,Staghorn corals are listed on Appendix II of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) and therefore trade in this coral should be carefully regulated and a permit is required to bring the coral or objects made from them into the countries that have signed the CITES convention (2). Staghorn corals will also form part of the marine community in many marine protected areas or in areas where management plans are in place to protect the coral community. In some areas coral reefs restoration attempts are being undertaken; in Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary efforts have been made to reattach coral fragments or culture and settle coral larvae. Both activities have had limited success and new techniques are being pursued (5). ,fishing;environmental;environment;invasive;disease;pet;pollution; ,cites;protected; ,7,2

River pipefish,Syngnathus watermeyeri,Estuarine pipefish (Syngnathus watermeyeri),Animalia,Chordata,Actinopterygii,Syngnathiforms,Syngnathidae,Syngnathus (1),Length: up to 13 cm (2),The loss of this species from the majority of its former range has been attributed to altered river systems caused by the construction of upstream dams. These developments restrict the supply of fresh water that brings with it essential nutrients required by the <strong>phytoplankton</strong> upon which the food chain depends (5). Much excitement greeted the discovery of an additional population of this pipefish in the East Kleinemonde Estuary but these fish are under increasing threat and not least because they are the last remaining members of the species (6). Developments along the river have led to silting problems; the creation of artificial beaches and the removal of reed beds have further threatened the delicate estuary ecosystem (6).,With the discovery of the remnant population of this species in 1996 the Western District Council adopted a management plan to protect this rare pipefish (6). Measures included a public awareness programme and the discouragement of powerboat riding. Unfortunately the plan has been poorly enforced and illegal developments along with an increase in planned developments have proliferated in the area (6). Unless stricter measures are bought into effect quickly it is likely that the river pipefish will become extinct once more this time with no reprieve. ,loss; , ,1,0
Animalia,Balebreviceps hillmani,Ethiopian short-headed frog (Balebreviceps hillmani),Animalia,Chordata,Amphibia,Anura,Microhylidae,Balebreviceps (1),Snout-vent length: up to 5.3 cm (2),Although reported to be fairly numerous at the site from which it was first recorded in 1986 the Ethiopian short-headed frog is thought to be restricted to a relatively small area and its habitat may be declining (1). The increasing human population in the Ethiopian Highlands is putting pressure on the land through agricultural development and overgrazing (2) (5) and although direct damage to the narrow belt of giant heath occupied by this frog is not thought likely in the near future any such damage would pose a significant threat to the species (1). Indirect effects of the logging of adjoining forests at slightly lower elevations may also threaten the Ethiopian short-headed frog (1) while other factors such as climate change and disease may present future problems (6).,The Ethiopian short-headed frog occurs within the Bale Mountains National Park although this area has yet to be officially gazetted (1) (2) (5). Conservation priorities for this unique and little-known amphibian include the protection of <em>Erica</em> heath and woodland and further survey work to better understand the species\xe2\x80\x99 ecology status and distribution (1). ,disease; , ,1,0

Its demise began with the discovery of St Helena Island in 1502; ever since the false gumwood has been used as timber for fires (2) and huge areas of its habitat have been cleared for pastures and the grazing of goats (2). Forests once inhabited by the false gumwood have been all but destroyed and native flora now covers less than one percent of the island\xe2\x80\x99s area (5).,There has been a significant amount of conservation action aimed at preserving all <strong>endemic</strong> flora of St. Helena. The earliest action during the 1970s was the control of the goat population on the island (4) after it was recognised that goats were causing major damage to almost all of St. Helena\xe2\x80\x99s wooded habitats (4). There are currently only a few wild goats left and all domestic goats must be kept penned by law (4). Then during 1985 conservation areas were created and under the Endangered Plants Propagation Programmehabitats where the false gumwood occurred were designated as <strong>endemic</strong> forest reserves (6). ,invasive;pet; , ,2,0

The main threat to survival of the crested iguana however comes from habitat destruction. Particular devastation is caused by introduced goats which were brought to Fiji in an effort improve the quality of life of local people (5). Goats have been released on fairly uninhabited islands where they graze on native trees and shrubs making these tropical paradises uninhabitable for iguanas (5).,The National Trust for Fiji (assisted by Taronga Zoo Sydney and the Kula Eco Park in Fiji) has worked for many years to preserve this enigmatic lizard (5). Yaduataba Island was cleared of goats in 1981 and declared a national sanctuary; today it is home to several thousand crested iguanas (5). A three year Fijian Crested Iguana Project has also been formulated by the Taronga Zoo Kula Eco Park Fijian National Trust and other organisations (8).

The population of flapper skates has seen a drastic decline in European waters following this intensive fishing pressure. Although no longer targeted in the majority of areas as the population is too low these fish are still threatened by fisheries <strong>bycatch</strong> (2).,Further research on the distribution of the species and the monitoring of life-cycles growth and so on will also need to be undertaken in order to successfully manage the recovery of this fish (2). ,fishing; , ,1,0
Flat-backed spider tortoise; kapidolo; Madagascar flat-shelled tortoise; Malagasy flat-tailed tortoise,Pyxis planicauda,Flat-shelled spider tortoise (Pyxis planicauda),Animalia,Chordata,Reptilia,Testudines,Testudinidae,Pyxis (1),Carapace length: up to 13.4 cm (2)Male weight: 300 â 400 g (2)Female weight: 475 â 670 g (2),Like Madagascar\xe2\x80\x99s other tortoises the flat-shelled spider tortoise has been severely threatened by rampant degradation of its habitat and harvesting for the international pet trade (2). Deforestation has been widespread largely due to conversion to agriculture and timber extraction (2) (5) (6). The species\xe2\x80\x99 already precarious position has been compounded by excessive harvesting to sell to private collectors which has resulted in its total elimination from some forest fragments. This species has also been sold in Chinese marketplaces for food. Even since their listing on Appendix I of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) with export of wild specimens therefore banned there have still been reports of tortoises being smuggled out illegally. In addition there are serious concerns that specimens advertised as \xe2\x80\x98captive-bred\xe2\x80\x99 are really captured from the wild. Given that the species has a low reproductive rate and it is mostly breeding females that are collected the flat-shelled spider tortoise has little capacity to recover from sustained over-harvesting.  Floods caused by cyclones are one of the natural threats which this species has to endure (2).,The majority of the flat-shelled tortoise\xe2\x80\x99s range now occurs within the recently designated Menabe Antimena protected area which offers some hope that a significant proportion of its remaining habitat will be preserved (6). Other protected areas of forest occur within this species\xe2\x80\x99 range such as the special Andranomena Forest Reserve and private Analabe Reserve but regulations are believed to have been rarely enforced and the precise status of the species in these areas is currently unknown (2). ,pet; ,cites;protected; ,1,2
Kinosternon depressum,Sternotherus depressus,Flattened musk turtle (Sternotherus depressus),Animalia,Chordata,Reptilia,Testudines,Kinosternidae,Sternotherus (1),Carapace length: up to 12 cm (2),The flattened musk turtle is most seriously threatened by habitat degradation and fragmentation and remaining populations are further threatened by disease pollution and siltation of its habitat and over-collection from the wild for the pet trade (2) (3) (7) (8). Pollution from mining forestry agricultural and industrial chemicals and residential sewage is thought to be responsible for the high levels of shell erosion and infections recently observed in this species as well as reducing numbers of <strong>molluscs</strong> and other <strong>invertebrates</strong> on which the species feeds (2). Excessive sediment accumulation (siltation) also appears to be having a dramatic impact on this small turtle possibly through smothering <strong>molluscs</strong> and other <strong>invertebrate</strong> food sources altering the habitat where this turtle seeks food and cover and accumulating heavy metals and chemical toxins (2) (3). In the 1970s and 80s commercial collecting for the pet trade further reduced some populations with large collections having been recorded and individuals advertised in several places for over 80 U.S. dollars each (2) (3) (4). It is also hard for flattened musk turtle populations to recover from any adverse changes due to its slowness to mature and low reproductive rate (see \xe2\x80\x98Biology\xe2\x80\x99) (2).,A bill passed by the Alabama legislature in May 1984 prohibits the taking of this species from the wild and may be a deterrent to commercial overexploitation in the future (9). The flattened musk turtle is also protected as threatened under the US Endangered Species Act of 1973 as amended. It is therefore a nationally-recognised species of concern and is fully protected by law. In addition a Federal Recovery Plan has been approved (2) (4). ,fragmentation;disease;pet;pollution; ,protected;endangered species act; ,4,2
Animalia,Tubastraea floreana,Floreana coral (Tubastraea floreana),Animalia,Cnidaria,Anthozoa,Scleractinia,Dendrophylliidae,Tubastraea (1),,Thought to once have been fairly widespread around the Gal\xc3\xa1pagos Islands since the <strong>El Ni\xc3\xb1o</strong> event of 1982-83 this coral has only been found at Cousins Rocks and Gardner Islet and despite searches specifically for this species Floreana coral has not been seen at Cousins Rocks since 2001 (1).    This suggests that Floreana coral populations suffered mortalities as a result of the <strong>El Ni\xc3\xb1o</strong> event and it is therefore likely that any other alterations to the water temperatures surrounding the Gal\xc3\xa1pagos Islands such as global climate change will also threaten this coral (1).,The unique biodiversity of the Gal\xc3\xa1pagos Islands and the surrounding waters is recognised and valued and thus the region is protected by being designated a Marine Reserve and World Heritage Site (1).  Floreana coral is also included in Appendix II of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) meaning that any international trade in this species should be carefully regulated (2).  Unfortunately neither of these measures protects this Critically Endangered coral from the threats of natural or man-induced climate change. , ,cites;protected; ,0,2
Charles mockingbird,Mimus trifasciatus,Floreana mockingbird (Mimus trifasciatus),Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Mimidae,Mimus (1),Length: 25 cm (2),With only 20 to 50 individuals left on Champion islet and an estimated 300 to 500 on Gardner (as of 2009) the Floreana mockingbird is one of the rarest and most threatened birds in the world (11). Its original extinction from Floreana was probably a combination of several factors including the introduction of black rats (<i>Rattus rattus</i>) and the loss of <i>Opuntia </i>habitat brought about by invasive herbivores (2) (3) (5). In contrast declines recorded in the two remaining satellite populations in some years are thought to be being primarily driven by an increase in the frequency of dry <strong>La Ni\xc3\xb1a</strong> years which lead to high levels of adult mortality (2) (5) (12). Due to its isolation since the extinction of the main population on Floreana Island the Champion population has lost a significant amount of genetic diversity and given its precariously small size is in a severely vulnerable state (2) (11). Fortunately the population on Gardner still contains a higher number of individuals and relatively high levels of genetic diversity (11). However a single extreme weather event or newly introduced predators could easily decimate the entire surviving population. This is not to mention the ever present spectre of an avian disease spreading to the mockingbird population or the introduction of the black rat from neighbouring Floreana (2) (5) (11).,In 2008 the Charles Darwin Foundation in collaboration with several other international organisations set out an emergency management plan to preserve the imperilled Floreana mockingbird by reintroducing it to its original home on Floreana. This bold scheme is expected to be carried out in phases over a period of approximately ten years. The initial phase will involve eradicating all introduced species from Floreana and developing a program to breed mockingbirds in captivity. This will be followed by the first release trials of wild or captive bred birds and finally the supervision and monitoring of the released population (11) (12). It is hoped that the first phases of the reintroduction will be started in 2009 the bicentenary of the birth of Charles Darwin (12) (13). ,loss;invasive;disease; , ,3,0

forest little owl; forest spotted owlet,Heteroglaux blewitti,Forest owlet (Heteroglaux blewitti),Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Strigiformes,Strigidae,Heteroglaux (1),Length: 23cm (2),A fragmented population of between 100 and 250 forest owlets is believed to be left in the wild (2). Given the relative rarity of this bird the severity of the various threats to the forest owlet are hard to discern. The\xa0<strong>deciduous forest</strong>\xa0on which the entire population relies has been severely exploited and the reduction of this habitat is thought to be the predominant strain on the surviving population. The degradation of the habitat is the result of local illegal tree felling for firewood and timber and also to provide space for farming and for new settlements (2).,Since its rediscovery research has been carried out to better understand the forest owlet. At the site of its rediscovery further forest losses have successfully been prevented and due to the area\xe2\x80\x99s strict protection Melghat Tiger Reserve remains the sturdiest sanctuary providing the perfect environment for roughly 100 individuals. A programme has been initiated that aims to increase the education and awareness of the locals about their environment (2). , ,cites;protected; ,0,2

FrÃ©gate beetle; FrÃ©gate Island beetle; giant FrÃ©gate beetle; giant tenebrionid beetle; Seychelles FrÃ©gate beetle,Polposipus herculeanus,Frigate Island giant tenebrionid beetle (Polposipus herculeanus),Animalia,Arthropoda,Insecta,Coleoptera,Tenebrionidae,Polposipus (1),Length: 25 â 30 mm (2),Since the relatively recent human colonisation of Fr\xc3\xa9gate Island habitat destruction has been extensive.  However the beetles remained abundant on the island and also survived the invasion by introduced predators (brown rats) (5). A fungal disease affecting the sangdragon trees on which this beetle relies may represent a threat to the species (3) (5). Indeed being restricted to just a single small island leaves the Frigate Island giant tenebrionid beetle particularly vulnerable to the effects of introduced alien species or disease as well as to natural disasters or extreme environmental events such as typhoons (5) (6).,In 2001 a successful rat eradication programme on Fr\xc3\xa9gate was undertaken removing this potential predator and threat (2) and population assessments were carried out in 1999 and 2001 (5). A breeding and research programme was also established at the Zoological Society of London\xe2\x80\x99s Invertebrate Conservation Unit in 1996 with the hope that the information gained would better inform conservation management in the wild (3) (6). The initial captive population has now expanded to a full European Breeding Programme and involves institutions in the UK Netherlands Poland and Latvia (3). One potential conservation measure is the translocation of the beetle to other islands near Fr\xc3\xa9gate either from wild or captive stock (4). In addition the DNA of this rare species has been entered and preserved in the \xe2\x80\x98Frozen Ark\xe2\x80\x99 (3). ,environmental;environment;disease; , ,3,0

Forests in the region have been extensively cleared so that little suitable habitat now remains. Furthermore it is thought that the species could be declining as a result of possible displacement by or even <strong>hybridisation</strong> with the rusty-faced parrot (<i>H. amazonina</i>). Although no major threats have been identified such a small range and population renders the species extremely vulnerable (5).,Fuertes\xe2\x80\x99s parrot is protected in the Alto Quind\xc3\xado Acaime and Ca\xc3\xb1on del Quind\xc3\xado Natural Reserves (5). Following the incredible rediscovery of this colourful parrot there has been a surge of conservation work in the region and nest boxes have been provided where few mature trees suitable for nesting remained. This initiative has been highly successful with 21 nest boxes active in 2005 and each box producing three chicks twice a year helping population numbers to slowly climb (4). , ,protected; ,0,1

Rats feed on eggs and chicks with dogs cats and pigs also taking adults. In addition the Galapagos hawk <i>Buteo galapagoensis</i> has been responsible for large losses of the adult population (2).,The Galapagos Islands are a national park and a World Heritage Site and are therefore protected. Some predator control has been carried out but a continuing programme is crucial to prevent the rat population re-establishing itself. Proposed schemes to prevent further decline of the Galapagos petrel include monitoring the breeding success of different populations under various predator control systems in order to determine the most successful (2). ,loss;pet; ,protected; ,2,1

Despite these efforts between 1997 and 2006 the wild population declined by 58 percent from 436 to just 182 breeding adults (1). Habitat loss and degradation poses the biggest threat to this species\xe2\x80\x99 survival as the human population explosion of the Indian subcontinent continues to encroach on the river systems where it is found (5). Dams irrigation projects sand mining and artificial embankments have all encroached on the gharial\xe2\x80\x99s habitat reducing its range to just two percent of what it was (1). In addition fishing removes important food sources and can cause clashes with fishermen leading to accidental or deliberate death. Eggs are collected for medicinal properties and adult males are hunted due to the belief that the snout has aphrodisiac effects (5).,Gharial population levels reached a catastrophic low in the 1970s prompting a massive rescue campaign (4). Restocking programmes involving captive breeding and ranching (wild eggs reared in captivity and then re-released) were established in India in 1975 and Nepal in 1978 and these worked to gradually bring this species back from the brink of extinction (5). However in recent years the population has suffered another devastating decline and in 2006 less than 200 breeding adults remained in the wild (1). The current decline indicates that no matter how many gharials are released into the wild habitat degradation and hunting need to be prevented to ensure the species\xe2\x80\x99 survival. Consequently the focus of current conservation efforts is moving away from captive breeding programmes towards other initiatives such as the protection of gharial habitat enforcement of the species\xe2\x80\x99 protected status and the education and involvement of local people in the species\xe2\x80\x99 conservation. At the forefront of this is the Gharial Conservation Alliance an international organisation of individuals dedicated to saving gharials from extinction (2). ,loss;fishing; ,captive breeding;protected; ,2,2

Although at present there are no signs of reduction of population size due to this take off it must be carefully monitored in the future to assure the survivorship of the species (5). Furthermore large-scale deforestation predation by introduced species and encroachment by humans are all posing threats to\xa0the golden frog\xa0(4).,All mantella frogs are listed on Appendix II of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) which controls international trade in these species (2). The golden frog is bred in captivity in a number of zoos and other breeding facilities including the Detroit Zoological Institute\xe2\x80\x99s National Amphibian Conservation Centre which breeds hundreds each year for use in breeding programmes in other institutions (6). The provision of captive-bred individuals to zoos reduces the stress on wild populations caused by collection. Captive breeding programmes may also provide a genetic reservoir of a species to safeguard it should the population undergo a drastic decline or even become extinct; they also provide sources of animals for reintroduction to the wild and allow research to be carried out (6). Although captive breeding is an important facet of any conservation programme protection of the remaining wild populations and the habitat on which they depend is of great importance (7). ,pet; ,cites;captive breeding; ,1,2
Queimada Island bothrops,Bothropoides insularis,Golden lancehead (Bothropoides insularis),Animalia,Chordata,Reptilia,Squamata,Viperidae,Bothropoides (1),Length: up to 110 cm (2),The golden lancehead has one of the largest population densities of any snake (4). However its overall population is relatively small between 2000 and 4000 individuals (4) (12) and is restricted to a single tiny island where its habitat is under threat from deforestation and burning (1) (4) (11). Its population is believed to have decreased in recent decades exacerbated by the removal of snakes from the island for the illegal wild animal trade (4) (11) (12) (13).,<i><em>Bothropoides</em></i> species are highly venomous and are considered to be particularly dangerous to humans as a group being responsible for about 90 percent of all serious snakebites in South America (6). However in recent years studies have shown the venom of the golden lancehead to have practical applications for humans with many potential medical uses making it even more important to protect this snake (4). ,environmental;environment; ,captive breeding; ,2,1

El Tucuche golden frog; Trinidad heart-tongued frog,Phytotriades auratus,Golden tree frog (Phytotriades auratus),Animalia,Chordata,Amphibia,Anura,Hylidae,Phytotriades (1),Maximum length: 4 cm (2),As there are just two known populations of the Critically Endangered golden tree frog in the world it is extremely vulnerable to the degradation of what little habitat remains. This little-known frog is further threatened by the over-collecting of specimens and of bromeliads (1). In addition declines in the population at Cerro del Aripo may be attributed to the chytrid fungus <em>Batrachochytrium</em> a disease causing fungi that is inflicting dramatic declines upon <strong>amphibian</strong> populations worldwide (2).\xa0,As this rare frog has an extremely limited range there is a pressing need to protect the golden tree frog\xe2\x80\x99s habitat. The importance of this is increased by the species\xe2\x80\x99 specialisation upon a single bromeliad species (1). El Tucuche is managed as a game reserve and access to the mountain requires government permission; however policing this legislation has proved challenging (2). Consequently in the absence of specific conservation measures the extent and quality of its habitat is continuing to dwindle (1) (2). ,disease; , ,1,0
Animalia,Cleptornis marchei,Golden white-eye (Cleptornis marchei),Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Zosteropidae,Cleptornis (1),Length: 14 cm (2),In the past 20 years this species has gone from being of no conservation concern to the brink of extinction (1). An expanding human population has undoubtedly had an impact on the species (7) despite its ability to persist in a range of habitats (2). Between 1982 and 2007 the human population on Saipan quadrupled resulting in development of much more of the island. During this period of the 11 land bird species found on Saipan the golden white-eye and two other species decreased in number (7).,The Mariana Avifauna Conservation Project aims to protect birds in the Mariana archipelago from the brown tree snake by forming populations of the native bird species via a captive breeding programme (6). Between 2007 and 2008 46 golden white-eyes were taken into captivity with the aim of initiating captive breeding in the near future (2). The continued control of brown tree snakes through trapping is an essential component of any conservation plan if this rare bird is to survive (2). \xa0 ,loss;invasive; ,captive breeding; ,2,1

Since then the population is likely to have declined further as around eight percent of <strong>cloud forest</strong> in Serran\xc3\xada del Pinche is degraded every year by agriculture primarily for the cultivation of coca (<em>Erythroxylum coca</em>) (2) (3).,Local authorities the Ministry of Environment The Hummingbird Conservancy Ecohabits Foundation and local residents are all working together on an ongoing conservation plan which aims to protect the habitat of the Serran\xc3\xada del Pinche and promote local conservation and education initiatives (2). Further studies to determine the population size and status of the gorgeted puffleg along with the creation of a protected area within the Serran\xc3\xada del Pinche have been proposed (3). , ,protected; ,0,1
Gough finch,Rowettia goughensis,Gough bunting (Rowettia goughensis),Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Emberizidae,Rowettia (1),Size: 18cm (2),This bird\xe2\x80\x99s occurrence in a restricted habitat of one very small island makes it extremely vulnerable to natural disasters like fires and hurricanes or to introduced diseases and especially to the accidental introduction of non-native predators (3). Indeed the introduced house mouse <i>Mus musculus </i>poses the greatest present threat through competition and predation (2). Buntings are found at low density in lowland areas where mice are abundant (2) and experiments with \xe2\x80\x98dummy\xe2\x80\x99 eggs imply that mouse predation on their nests is very high (5). Thus researchers think the bird may have been forced by these mice from the best nesting sites into less suitable upland regions (5). Over the last 15 years the proportion of juveniles in the population has declined from 50% to 20% this appears to indicate that there are now too few young surviving to reproductive age to sustain the population.,Gough Island is both a Nature Reserve and World Heritage Site and while this provides good protection from human disturbance it does not offer the Gough bunting any protection from the mouse predation that is driving it towards extinction (2). A study of the mice conducted by The Royal Society for the Protection of Birds (RSPB) and funded by the UK government's Overseas Territories Environment Programme has shown that their eradication from the island is feasible. Unfortunately however until adequate funding from the UK government is supplied this will not occur (6). Gough Island is widely recognised as having one of the most diverse bird colonies in the world including four endangered species and every effort should therefore be made to protect it and the rich biodiversity it hosts (7). ,disease;pet; , ,2,0

The conversion of the land for agriculture and widespread hunting which became more prevalent with the onset of vehicle transport have both contributed to the precipitous decline in this species (2).,The great Indian bustard is listed in Schedule I of the Wildlife (Protection) Act of 1972 in India and international trade is prohibited by its listing on Appendix I of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) (5). A number of sanctuaries have been set up with the aim of preserving this species; however this may not be the most effective means of conservation as population numbers have continued to decline. The Bombay Natural History Society (BNHS) is urging the Indian Government to adopt a \xe2\x80\x98Project Bustard\xe2\x80\x99 scheme along the same lines of \xe2\x80\x98Project Tiger\xe2\x80\x99 (5). Such a high-profile project would be invaluable for raising awareness about the plight of India\xe2\x80\x99s 4 bustard species and would be an important method of preserving the arid grassland habitat that is currently poorly protected in this country (6). ,loss;hunting;poaching; ,cites;protected; ,3,2

Bamboo is also being cleared in some areas and this lemur is targeted by hunters in other regions (3). The known range of the greater bamboo lemur is highly restricted and this implies further threats to survival (3).,The greater bamboo lemur is protected within two areas in Madagascar however even within Ranomafana National Park the native trees are being exploited and this species is at risk (3).

The brooks in Greece on which much of the remaining population appears to rely are particularly threatened (1).,There are currently no conservation initiatives targeting this species. It has been suggested that there is a need for surveys on the Peloponnisos and Corfu to establish the extent of the species\xe2\x80\x99 range. If no populations are found to lie in protected areas obtaining legal protection for at least some of the population would become a priority.

Development for both urban and rural uses has led to the widespread alteration of the specific bog habitat of this species (5). Pitcher plants have also been over-collected for the commercial plant trade; such exotic species are very popular with collectors (5). Today around 34 naturally occurring populations persist but these are small and highly fragmented; most consist of fewer than 50 individuals (5).,Green pitcher plants are listed as Endangered on the United States Endangered Species Act and there is an Action Plan for their recovery (2). The Recovery Plan focuses on the effective protection of existing populations as the most important threat to the future of the green pitcher plant is over-collection (5). Collection is banned by legislation within the States and also internationally by the listing of this species on Appendix I of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) (3). <glos><i>Ex-situ</i></glos> conservation measures are also in place; seeds are stored at the USDA National Seed Technology Laboratory in Fort Collins and Atlanta Botanical Garden is propagating plants from seeds for future reintroduction programmes (5). , ,cites;endangered species act; ,0,2

Due to the saw and their large size this species becomes entangled in nets very easily; as they are difficult to set free they rarely survive becoming caught in this way (4). Direct fishing has also been a problem; this sawfish has been widely caught for its fins for use in the shark fin soup industry its saw and for its flesh (4). The high price of the fins in Asian markets increase the threats facing all members of this family (3). Furthermore degradation of the soft-bottomed habitats upon which they depend has been widespread (4).,This species is classified as Critically Endangered on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species (1). Current recovery actions include carrying out further research into the distribution and ecology of this sawfish and encouraging its protection (4). It has been proposed that an Australian national recovery team should be established in order to set up and coordinate the recovery programme for this and other threatened sawfish (3). ,fishing; , ,1,0

The main threat to this species is hunting for food and for use in traditional \xe2\x80\x98medicines\xe2\x80\x99 (1). It is also captured in snares for the pet trade although captive animals rarely survive long due to their highly sensitive digestive system (1) (4). At Kon Cha Rang Nature Reserve which contains one of the largest remaining grey-shanked douc populations there is a traditional hunting season in September with large numbers of snares set in trees to catch this monkey (8). The grey-shanked douc is also particularly vulnerable to hunting with guns as in response to disturbance it typically remains motionless in the canopy rather than fleeing (1). This exploitation is compounded by the loss of the grey-shanked douc\xe2\x80\x99s forest habitat which is highly fragmented and degraded and continues to be lost to logging and agriculture at a rate of around 100 square kilometres per year (1). Many communities surrounding these forests employ shifting agricultural strategies with a tendency to convert forest farming and livestock grazing areas greatly increasing the pressure on this rare monkey\xe2\x80\x99s habitat (8).\xa0\xa0,Supporting at least 24 species of primate a quarter of which are thought to be <strong>endemic</strong> the protection of Vietnam\xe2\x80\x99s natural habitats is of critical importance to primate conservation (4). However conservation efforts in Vietnam are far too often hindered by the weakness of the country\xe2\x80\x99s protective legislation and law enforcement allowing hunting and habitat loss to continue to threatened many rare species. This is further compounded by the dependency of many people upon natural resources and the small amount of funds allocated to conservation work (9).\xa0 ,loss;hunting;pet; ,protection law; ,3,1

A lack of food resources especially around French Frigate Shoals has been cited as the cause of high juvenile mortality and the presence of severely emaciated individuals (7). In addition entanglement in marine debris that accumulates in these islands from vast areas of the Pacific as well as disturbance further threatens this species (6). Non-human threats such as predation by sharks and the prevalence of violent \xe2\x80\x98mobbing\xe2\x80\x99 behaviour of mature males also play a part in the decline of monk seal numbers (4).,The Hawaiian monk seal has been listed on the United States Endangered Species List since 1976 and the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) is responsible for the management of the population (7). Major colonies are surveyed annually and beach counts help to give an indication of the state of each breeding population (7); flipper tagging has been carried out since the early 1980s (6). The Northwest Hawaiian Islands lobster fishery was closed in 2000 and this may help to increase prey availability (6). In 2000 the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands Coral Reef Ecosystem Reserve was established which should help to protect the habitat of this unique seal (7). , , ,0,0
Caret; Tortue Ã  bec faucon; Tortue Ã  Ã©cailles; Tortue Caret; Tortue imbriquÃ©e,Eretmochelys imbricata,Hawksbill turtle (Eretmochelys imbricata),Animalia,Chordata,Reptilia,Testudines,Cheloniidae,Eretmochelys (1),45 - 75 kg (2),Global numbers are very difficult to estimate but it appears that the hawksbill turtle has suffered a drastic decline probably by as much as 80 percent over the last century (1). Major threats to survival come from illegal trade in the turtle's prized shell known as tortoiseshell which has been sought for jewellery and ornaments for centuries. There is also a substantial market for eggs meat and even stuffed juveniles as exotic gifts in some parts of the world (10). Additional pressure on the global population comes from harvests to support traditional customs the loss of nesting sites accidental entanglement in fishing lines and the deterioration of coral reef systems which act as feeding sites for these turtles (11).,International trade in the hawksbill turtle is banned amongst signatory nations by its listing on Appendix I of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) (3)\xa0but extensive illegal trafficking still occurs. Preventing this black market trade is the key to saving this species and TRAFFIC (the wildlife trade monitoring network) is involved in monitoring and highlighting this problem (14). In 1988 the government of the Seychelles took a very public stand against tortoiseshell trade by burning a stockpile of seized shells (4) in a manner reminiscent of burning ivory pyres in Kenya (10). ,loss;fishing; ,cites;protected; ,2,2

Animalia,Hemicycla saulcyi,Hemicycla (Hemicycla saulcyi),Animalia,Mollusca,Gastropoda,Stylommatophora,Helicidae,Hemicycla (1),Length: 24 - 28 mm (2),The natural ecosystems of Gran Canaria are highly deteriorated a situation which has had negative impacts on a variety of <strong>endemic</strong> species (4). Habitat loss has drastically reduced the range of <em>Hemicycla saulcyi</em> and the species is now restricted to a small isolated population occupying a total area of under four square kilometres (2) (4) (5) (6). Most of La Isleta is an old military base which has so far prevented encroachment by the city of Las Palmas de Gran Canaria. However this base is being closed and the likely increase in building and development in the area could be disastrous for this species (2) (5) (7). A further potential threat may come from the spread of introduced snails which are believed to compete with the <strong>endemic</strong> snail species potentially displacing them from some areas (4). Predation by rats mice and lizards may also be a problem (3).,No species of land snail in the Canary Islands currently receives direct legal protection and therefore indirect protection through preservation of its habitat will be all the more vital to both <em>Hemicycla saulcyi</em> and other threatened <strong>endemic</strong> snails (2) (4) (7). It has been recommended that the north-western part of La Isleta be made a Special Nature Reserve in order to prevent building and development in the area. A Recovery Plan has also been recommended to promote the restoration of the natural vegetation (2) (4). With only around thirty living specimens of <em>Hemicycla saulcyi saulcyi</em> observed to date the total population may be tiny (2) (6) and without adequate protection the future for this highly endangered <strong>mollusc</strong> is uncertain. ,loss;pet; , ,2,0

Poisons used for pest control seem to be inadvertently affecting the lizard population (7).,Plans for conservation of this species are not extensive.  The United Nations and the Canary Islands Autonomous Government funded a program for the captive breeding and <strong>re-introduction</strong> of the Hierro giant lizard to its original natural habitat.  This management plan began in late 1997 and ran until early 2000 (7) (8).  Juveniles are more suitable for re-introduction as the sprint escape performance of the adult lizard is diminished by prolonged captivity (9). , ,captive breeding; ,0,1

Hunterâs antelope; Hunterâs hartebeest,Beatragus hunteri,Hirola (Beatragus hunteri),Animalia,Chordata,Mammalia,Cetartiodactyla,Bovidae,Beatragus (1),80 - 118 kg (2),Numbers of hirola have declined severely from 10000 in the 1970s to an estimated 500 to 2000 in 1995\xa0to 1996; numbers have fallen by 85 to 90 percent since 1980 (2). Competition with cattle severe drought disease and poaching are all factors that have contributed to devastating hirola populations (3) (4).\xa0Unfortunately the hirola\xe2\x80\x99s preference for areas that are used by livestock puts them at increased risk from diseases like rinderpest and tuberculosis (3).,In 1963 10 to 20 hirola were released into Tsavo East National Park Kenya which grew to a population of 79 individuals by 1996. In 1996 another 29 hirola were <strong>translocated</strong> into the Tsavo East population resulting in an estimated population of 100 hirola in Tsavo East National Park (6).\xa0The Hirola Management Committee (HMC) was also formed in 1994 with the aim of conserving this species in their natural range.\xa0 The HNC created the Hirola Strategic Management Plan which outlined hirola conservation measures for the next five years (7). This included creating protected areas reducing exposure to livestock diseases careful monitoring and promoting income generating eco-tourism for this unique species (7); measures that will hopefully pull this beautiful antelope back from the edge of extinction. ,poaching;disease;pet; ,protected; ,3,1

Additionally this iguana is threatened by local subsistence hunting and predation from introduced carnivores such as dogs cats and mongooses. Hunting for Hispaniolan ground iguanas for food and trade has increased gradually since the mid 1970s this species at one time being served at oriental restaurants in Santo Domingo as a speciality dish (1).,International trade in the Hispaniolan ground iguana is controlled by its listing under Appendix I of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) (3). Compliance with CITES trade regulations is largely effective although occasional smuggling of animals across the Haitian border does still occur. Enforcement of national protective legislation in the Dominican Republic has improved in the last few years but fails to go far enough since clearing of natural habitat for development is neither being prevented nor regulated and illegal hunting for food and the local pet market continues (1). However the Isla Cabritos range which used to be intensively exploited for hardwood cutting charcoal and livestock grazing has undergone extensive natural regeneration in the last 15 years and improved protective management since 1992 has meant present conditions there are stable (4). Indianapolis Zoo has had a small but successful captive breeding programme although survivorship of young has been low (1) and there are plans to re-establish new breeding colonies at both the Parque Zoologico Nacional (ZooDom) in the Dominican Republic and the Indianapolis Zoo (4). The establishment of local educational awareness campaigns to try to reduce illegal hunting the strengthening and enforcing of protective legislation and the implementation of research monitoring and recovery programmes will be essential in guiding effective conservation efforts in the future (2). ,loss;hunting; ,cites;captive breeding; ,2,2

Kollar's spinetail,Synallaxis kollari,Hoary-throated spinetail (Synallaxis kollari),Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Furnariidae,Synallaxis (1),ca. 16 g (3),The main threat to the hoary-throated spinetail is the rapid conversion of its habitat to rice plantations with the burning of vegetation potentially posing a further problem (3) (4) (7). Although still thought to be relatively common where it occurs the species is restricted to a tiny and fragmented range none of which is officially protected and is believed to number only around 5000 or so individuals (2) (3) (4) (7). With so little known about the hoary-throated spinetail there is also the potential for unidentified threats to take a toll on the species before they are recognised (9).,Although not occurring within officially protected areas nearly 60 percent of the hoary-throated spinetail\xe2\x80\x99s habitat is inside indigenous reserves where the indigenous people have a much better record of maintaining the ecosystem than non-indigenous peoples. Most rice production in Roraima is carried out illegally by non-indigenous people on indigenous land but in some areas such as S\xc3\xa3o Marcos Indigenous Reserve rice producers have been evicted hopefully giving renewed hope for the wildlife there (3) (4) (7). Producers should also have been evicted from Raposa-Serra do Sol following its legalisation in 2005 but this is not yet known to have occurred (3) (7). , ,protected; ,0,1

Conversion of habitat and overhunting have also reduced populations of the lynx\xe2\x80\x99s main food source the rabbit and rabbit numbers also declined drastically after the introduction of the myxomatosis virus in the 1950s (1) (3) (5). Whilst myxomatosis is not such a threat today a new disease that arrived in Spain in 1988 known as Rabbit Haemorrhagic Disease is once again threatening rabbit numbers (1)\xa0(3) (5). Despite protection measures and heavy fines illegal hunting continues and the accidental killing of lynx in rabbit traps traps set for smaller carnivores or with poisoned fox bait together with road fatalities are some of the major causes of mortality at present (3) (5).\xa0,The Iberian lynx is legally protected in both <st1:country-region w:st="on">Spain</st1:country-region> and <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Portugal</st1:place></st1:country-region> (1) and is also listed on Appendix I of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) meaning international trade in the species is prohibited (4).

This has included measures to increase rabbit numbers within the park through habitat improvements and the removal of <strong>ungulates</strong> thus reducing competition with rabbits for food (3). However rabbit numbers still remain low (1). Around the park efforts are also underway to reduce traffic fatalities and to eliminate the trapping of rabbits and small carnivores (3).\xa0 ,loss;hunting;disease; ,cites;captive breeding;protected; ,3,3

Vultur indicus,Gyps indicus,Indian vulture (Gyps indicus),Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Falconiformes,Accipitridae,Gyps (1),Length: 92 cm (2),In common with other <i>Gyps</i> species the Indian vulture has suffered serious declines since the late 1990s losing as much as 95 percent of the population. The unnaturally high death toll was thought to be caused by a fatal virus but testing has revealed that vultures are suffering from kidney failure following the consumption of cattle that had previously been treated with the anti-inflammatory drug diclofenac (2). In fact the decline is a result of a lethal level of the drug in a small proportion of the <strong>ungulate</strong> carcasses available to vultures but as vultures travel long distances to reach <strong>carrion</strong> a considerable proportion of the population has been affected (7). The full extent of the decline of <i>Gyps</i> vulture species is already being felt by humans as rotting carcasses remain untouched posing a health hazard as well as encouraging feral dog populations which carry rabies (8).,It is considered necessary to prevent exposure of vultures to livestock carcasses that have been contaminated with diclofenac and to find an alternative replacement drug (7). Government commitment to the control of the use of the drug is crucial but until it has been entirely removed from the environment a collaboration of bird protection organisations plan to take all vultures into captivity for the next 20 to 30 years to avoid further deaths which would further reduce the chance of a successful recovery of this already rare species (8). , , ,0,0

Forests are being cleared and watercourses altered in the process of cultivating the land for human use which is often achieved at the detriment of the turtles' natural habitat (6). Another major threat to the survival of this species comes from the pet trade; between 1989 and 94 almost 33000 specimens of the genus <i>Corus</i> (Asian box turtles) were imported into the United States (6). An additional threat may come from the increasing demand for turtles for food and medicines especially in China (6).,More information is urgently needed on the distribution and behaviour of this shy box turtle. The Indochinese box turtle is listed on Appendix II of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) (3) but trade remains one of the key features of its decline. More data on distribution of this species is vital if a comprehensive conservation plan is to be established. ,pet; ,cites; ,1,1

Animalia,Holoaden bradei,Itatiaia highland frog (Holoaden bradei),Animalia,Chordata,Amphibia,Anura,Strabomantidae,Holoaden (1),Snout-vent length: up to 3.7 cm (2),This small frog was previously described as being very abundant at the site from which it was first described (2) and was frequently found up until the 1970s (1). However it has now not been seen in the wild for more than ten years despite extensive searches leading to fears that it may already have become extinct (1). The species has not been recorded outside of one small area of less than ten square kilometres and is believed to have declined due to a reduction in the extent and quality of its habitat as a result of touristic activities and fire. The species is also reported to be affected by extreme frosts (1). It is not known to what extent the Itatiaia highland frog may also have been impacted by factors such as climate change disease and pollution which are presenting great threats to amphibian species worldwide (7).,The range of the Itatiaia highland frog lies within the Parque Nacional do Itatiaia (1) and the species has been listed as Critically Endangered in Brazil (8). Extensive surveys are needed to determine whether this rare amphibian still survives in the wild and if it is found urgent conservation measures will be needed to save the remaining individuals including a conservation management plan and the continued conservation and preservation of its habitat (1). ,disease;pollution; , ,2,0

Logging mining plantations and other forms of exploitation have swept away the once extensive tracts of pristine forest that were home to this woodpecker. Logging of the mature forests that form its habitat was probably the major cause of the disappearance of this species (2). Although incredible recent discoveries have provided new hope for both the U.S. and Cuban <strong>subspecies</strong> previously considered extinct the ivory-billed woodpecker is nevertheless clinging on to an extremely precarious existence.,Searches for the elusive ivory-billed woodpecker in the mountains of southern Cuba and in the U.S. continue.

Today this species is significantly affected by invasive non-native predators including mongooses cats pigs and stray dogs which eat juvenile iguanas or destroy nests (1) (2) (6) (9) (12).,Much has now been done to try and save the Jamaican ground iguana and this rare lizard is now a flagship species for conservation in the West Indies (6). The Jamaican ground iguana is listed on Appendix I of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) which prohibits international trade in this species (5) and it is also listed as \xe2\x80\x98Endangered\xe2\x80\x99 on the U.S. Endangered Species Act (14).

In addition habitat loss resulting from logging activities and development has impacted the species and the two critically small populations are also exceptionally vulnerable to disease and natural disasters both of which could wipe out an entire population (6).,In Indonesia the Javan rhino has been legally protected since 1931 and Ujung Kulon National Park was set aside for the conservation of this species. The protected area in which the Vietnamese Javan rhinoceros occurs (previously known as the Cat Loc Nature Reserve) was for many years ineffectively protected (6) but since the Cat Loc area was integrated into the Cat Tien National Park in 1998 more forest guards have been deployed and the conservation organisation WWF has been supporting these teams with better equipment and allowances (7). ,loss;hunting;disease; ,protected;wwf; ,3,2

Successful cultivation in botanic gardens has occurred in very humid conditions but high humidity is unlikely in the exposed habitat where these trees are found in the wild (3). It has been suggested that jellyfish trees have been lost from the more appropriate habitat of moist forests through competition with other species and climate change (3).,Three of the existing populations of jellyfish tree on the island on Mah\xc3\xa9 (Bernica Copolia and Mt. Jasmin) are protected within the Morne Seychellois National Park (3). Although seedlings have been grown in a number of botanic gardens many problems remain and a conservation priority must be further research into the reproductive biology of this intriguing species before any effective Action Plan for its future can be devised (3). ,pet; ,protected; ,1,1
Cursorius bitorquatus,Rhinoptilus bitorquatus,Jerdonâs courser (Rhinoptilus bitorquatus),Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Charadriiformes,Glareolidae,Rhinoptilus (1),Average head-body length: 27 cm (2),Jerdon\xe2\x80\x99s courser has an extremely limited range and a very small population estimated between 50 and 240 individuals (1). The principal threat to Jerdon\xe2\x80\x99s courser is loss and degradation of habitat.\xa0 Inhabiting scrub forest bordering villages and agricultural land it is vulnerable to the effects of livestock overgrazing firewood collecting forest clearing for agriculture bird trapping and direct human disturbance. Extensive areas of suitable habitat have also been lost through quarrying and mining (5) (6). Between 1991 and 2000 an estimated 11 to 15 percent of suitable habitat was lost while forest patches became smaller and fragmented (9). Furthermore the construction in 2005 of the Telugu-Ganga Canal resulted in the loss of Jerdon\xe2\x80\x99s courser habitat and the destruction of one newly-discovered site for the species (6). The recent construction of the Somasilla dam resulted in the relocation of 57 villages to the Lankamalai region bordering Jerdon\xe2\x80\x99s courser habitat. This is expected to increase the disturbances on Jerdon\xe2\x80\x99s courser habitat as the settlers are dependant on the forests for resources such as firewood and livestock grazing (4).\xa0\xa0\xa0,As a direct result of the re-discovery of Jerdon\xe2\x80\x99s courser the Lankamalleswara Wildlife Sanctuary was established with the aims of protecting the species and its habitat (6). Since 2001 the Bombay Natural History Society in collaboration with the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds and the Universities of Cambridge and Reading have been working to determine the distribution and habitat requirements of the species. The application of tracking strips camera traps and audio-playback methodologies have successfully identified new locations for Jerdon\xe2\x80\x99s courser investigated habitat usage and evaluated threats (7) (8). Lobbying against the construction of the Telugu-Ganga canal through the Jerdon\xe2\x80\x99s courser's range successfully avoided further habitat destruction and fragmentation in 1986 but in 2005 the canal project recommenced and resulted in the destruction of some Jerdon\xe2\x80\x99s Courser habitat. However although canal construction proceeded the route was modified to make it less damaging and 1000 hectares of additional land were acquired by the Andhra Pradesh Forest Department in compensation (6) (10). If Jerdon\xe2\x80\x99s courser can be restored on this degraded land the future prospects of the species can be improved (5). Further proposed measures include a radio-telemetry study to determine ecological requirements for the species and the initiation of conservation awareness programmes amongst local communities to minimise habitat loss and alteration (4). ,loss; , ,1,0
ColibrÃ­ de Juan FernÃ¡ndez,Sephanoides fernandensis,Juan FernÃ¡ndez firecrown (Sephanoides fernandensis),Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Apodiformes,Trochilidae,Sephanoides (1),Male length: 11.5 - 12 cm (2)Female length: c. 10.5 cm (2)Male weight: 10.9 g (2)Female weight: 6.8 g (2),Population numbers of the Juan Fern\xc3\xa1ndez firecrown are thought to be in the low hundreds (1) and theJuan Fern\xc3\xa1ndez Islands are among the 11 most seriously threatened natural areas in the world as a result of hundreds of years of habitat degradation and the introduction of exotic species (4). Repeated burning deforestation and the introduction of animals and plants and consequently disease have resulted in 75 percent of the <strong>endemic</strong> <strong>vascular flora</strong> being on the verge of extinction (7). This together with the introduction of rabbits and goats has reduced vegetation cover and increased erosion so that now more than 15 percent of the island is severely eroded and lacking vegetation (6). The introduced species that are of specific concern for the Juan Fern\xc3\xa1ndez firecrown include rats dogs pigs semi-feral cattle rabbits which have severely affected the low elevation flora including some hummingbird nectar plants; coatis and bramble. Coatis thrive throughout both lowland and upland areas and are opportunistic foragers feeding on the birds and their eggs; while bramble shades out regenerating forest (6) and bears flowers too small for the Juan Fern\xc3\xa1ndez firecrown to feed on (2). Due to these changes in habitat the green-backed firecrown (<i>Sephanoides sephanoides</i>) which can feed on brambleis increasing in number and is competing with the Juan Fern\xc3\xa1ndez firecrown for space. The Juan Fern\xc3\xa1ndez firecrown is also less able to protect itself from predation than the green-backed firecrown. In addition to these threats is the steady impact of collection by scientists and private collectors (6).,The Juan Fern\xc3\xa1ndez Islands were designated a national park in 1935 (although not actively protected until 1967) and a biosphere reserve in 1977. The Chilean government began a recovery project in 1997 to restore natural habitat and the islands have since been nominated for World Heritage listing (5). The World Conservation Union (IUCN) has recommended that the population of the Juan Fern\xc3\xa1ndez firecrown is monitored that all introduced mammals are removed introduced plant populations are controlled native flora is replanted and that grazing restrictions are enforced within the national park (5). This beautiful little bird is at great threat of extinction because of the dangerously low numbers in the single remaining population. Conservation measures need to be taken immediately to protect the native habitat on the Juan Fern\xc3\xa1ndez Islands and in particular to control bramble and coati numbers if this hummingbird is to survive (6). ,disease;pet; ,protected; ,2,1

Animalia,Podiceps taczanowskii,JunÃ­n grebe (Podiceps taczanowskii),Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Podicipediformes,Podicipedidae,Podiceps (1),Length: 33 â 38 cm (2),Being restricted to only one lake makes the Junin grebe extremely vulnerable to any changes in the lake. Changes to Lake Junin have resulted in the decline of the grebe from over 1000 in 1961 to probably around 200 individuals in 2007 (5) (7). In addition to this general decline population numbers also fluctuate according to the water level of the lake (7). The Upamayo Dam as part of a hydro-electric plant regulates the water level of Lake Junin creating fluctuations in the water level that can cause nearly half the lake\xe2\x80\x99s surface to dry up including important nesting and foraging areas for the grebes (3) (6) (8). As no young are raised when water levels are very low this regulation has a significant negative impact on the Junin grebe. However the greatest threat it faces and what will ultimately lead to its extinction if not halted is pollution of the lake from mining waste. Waste waters from surrounding mines in the area enter the lake causing water pollution and an accumulation of iron oxides in the lake sediments. The sedimentation of iron oxides causes large parts of the lake bottom to become lifeless and therefore much of the offshore area is no longer adequate feeding habitat (3) (9).,Lake Junin was designated a National Reserve in 1974 which has limited hunting and fishing in the lake but has had no affect on the primary threats of mining and dam-building activities (5). In 1999 Lake Junin was declared to be in a state of emergency resulting in the formation of a committee which implemented an environmental management plan (8). This involves further protection of the lake restrictions on the extraction of water and provisions for its cleaning (5). However much work is still required to prevent further pollution of the lake and restore the habitat. Continuing pollution will inevitably lead to the extinction of the Junin grebe unless a \xe2\x80\x9creserve\xe2\x80\x9d population is established in another location. <strong>Translocation</strong> of the Junin grebe to a lake north of Lake Junin was attempted but unfortunately the use of gill-nets to fish trout in this lake made it unsuitable (7). In 1997 the IUCN Grebe Specialist Group created a Global Conservation Strategy to ensure the successful recovery of grebe populations and the management of wetlands (9). Particular conservation actions recommended for this species include carrying out studies of other lakes to identify suitable locations for further <strong>translocation</strong> attempts as well as taking steps to prevent pollutants from entering Lake Junin and to de-toxify lake sediments (9). ,pollution; , ,1,0

owl parrot,Strigops habroptila,Kakapo (Strigops habroptila),Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Psittaciformes,Psittacidae,Strigops (1),950 - 4,000 g (3),The first human settlers of New Zealand were the Maori who hunted kakapo for their feathers and meat; the Polynesian dog and rat introduced by the Maori also preyed upon this species (5). When Europeans began to settle in the 1800s the range of the kakapo had already dramatically declined and the situation became critical as Europeans set about clearing forests hunting and releasing mammalian predators such as domestic cats dogs stoats and rats. The kakapo is particularly vulnerable to predation by mammals due to its strong scent habit of freezing when threatened and especially its ground nesting behaviour (5) and flightlessness; the latter together with very slow breeding strategies are key elements in the demise of many endangered and extinct New Zealand species (8). Introduced possums and deer compete with the kakapo for food sources (5).,The drastic measure of removing all surviving kakapo to predator-free islands has averted extinction of this remarkable bird. There is a National Kakapo Team and a ten-year Recovery Plan for the species (5). Measures to conserve the kakapo include intensive invasive management of free-living individuals including supplementary feeding in order to stimulate and support breeding and measures to improve the survival of chicks. Although research and management are ongoing the dedication and hard work have paid off and initial results are very encouraging; the kakapo population has increased from 51 individuals in 1995 to 86 in 2002 (3). Unfortunately in July 2004 three young female kakapos died as the result of a mystery infection taking the total population down to 83 individuals. New Zealand's Department of Conservation was quick to respond giving the remaining kakapos antibiotics (9). A productive year in 2009 saw the kakapo population increase to 124 individuals (10) although the loss of a male in February 2010 brought the total down to 123 (5). In January 2012 the kakapo population stood at 127 individuals (11). ,hunting;pet; , ,2,0

In Arizona high water discharges from the Glen Canyon Dam situated upriver from the Grand Canyon National Park results in snails being swept downstream and the loss of suitable habitat (2) while in Utah the Kanab amber snail population is at risk due to the alteration of its habitat by a private landowner (2) (3).,The Arizona Game and Fish Department and the National Park Service have attempted to establish a new wild population of Kanab amber snails in Grand Canyon National Park. In September 1998 snails were taken from Vasey\xe2\x80\x99s Paradise and introduced to three natural springs in areas which would not be affected by dam operations. Further individuals were <strong>translocated</strong> in July 1999 to boost population densities and improve <strong>genetic variation</strong>. Since that initial stocking in 1998 a population seems to have established at one site the Upper Elves Chasm (3). It is hoped that the successful establishment of this additional wild Kanab amber snail population in Arizona will greatly aid in the conservation of this rare species (3). ,loss; , ,1,0

Atlantic ridley turtle,Lepidochelys kempii,Kempâs ridley turtle (Lepidochelys kempii),Animalia,Chordata,Reptilia,Testudines,Cheloniidae,Lepidochelys (1),27 â 40 kg (2),Kemp\xe2\x80\x99s ridley turtle suffered a dramatic decline during the 1950s - 60s due mainly to the over harvesting of eggs natural predation and mortality caused by trawl fisheries (6). Because nesting occurs in such large concentrations with shallow poorly disguised nests eggs are easily exploited by human collectors (by whom they are valued for their aphrodisiac properties) and by natural predators such as coyotes (5). Today the main threat to the survival of the species comes from shrimp trawlers which often operate in areas where turtles feed turtles accidentally caught in nets (<strong>by-catch</strong>) drown to death and it is estimated that between 500 to 5000 turtles are killed in this way each year (6).,International trade in Kemp\xe2\x80\x99s ridley turtles and products is banned under their listing on Appendix I of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) and the main nesting beach has been declared a National Reserve since the 1970s (5). During the breeding season nests are protected by armed patrols and subsequently very little illegal trade occurs (2). Turtle Excluding Devices (TEDs) fitted to shrimp nets can help to prevent <strong>by-catch</strong> by allowing only shrimp-sized objects to enter the net (6). There has been an international drive to introduce these devices worldwide and shrimp trawlers operating in United States waters must now be fitted with TEDs (6). These conservation efforts have led to the slow recovery of Kemp\xe2\x80\x99s ridley turtle numbers and it has been suggested that a population goal of 10000 nesting females could be reached by 2010 (2) allowing arribadas to once again adorn the Mexican coast. , ,cites;protected; ,0,2

Logging charcoal-making hunting and unmanaged resource extraction are common in the Rungwe-Livingstone forests (1) (4). The narrow forest corridors linking Mt Rungwe to Livingstone and joining the northern and southern sections of Livingstone are all highly degraded. Fragmentation of the remaining forests threatens to split the population into three smaller isolated subpopulations (4). While the monkey\xe2\x80\x99s total known range at Rungwe-Livingstone is around 70 km\xc2\xb2 at Ndundulu it is just 3 km\xc2\xb2 (1). The kipunji is one of the three threatened monkey species identified in the Udzungwa Mountains a testament to the biologically rich but fragile ecosystems of the region (5).,The kipunji occurs in the Kitulo National Park on Mount Rungwe which should help protect the small Livingstone Forest population there but swift action is needed to also preserve the connecting forest corridors. Although the forests of Ndundulu are in excellent condition the population is small and outside of the Udzungwa Mountains National Park in the adjacent unprotected Ndundulu Forest Reserve. This has prompted calls for the area to be better protected by expanding the boundaries of Udzungwa Mountains National Park westward to include all of the Ndundulu Forest (1). Indeed the Udzungwa Mountains represent an amazing biodiversity \xe2\x80\x98hotspot\xe2\x80\x99 and this incredible discovery of a third threatened monkey species affirms its status as one of the most important regions for primate conservation in Africa (5).

Cambodian forest ox; grey ox; Indo-Chinese forest ox; spiral horned ox,Bos sauveli,Kouprey (Bos sauveli),Animalia,Chordata,Mammalia,Cetartiodactyla,Bovidae,Bos (1),680 â 910 kg (2),The kouprey has been known to Western science since 1937 (7) although it had been discovered previously when in 1929 an American man and his son shot and killed an unidentified ungulate to use as tiger bait whilst big game hunting. The bones were recovered and sent to the University of Kansas\xe2\x80\x99 Museum of Natural History but were not examined until 1982 (8).  The only significant scientific observation of the kouprey was made in 1957 when zoologist Charles Wharton studied and filmed the animal in the wild (9).  By 1970 it was thought to be extinct following continued hunting for meat and for their horns and skulls for use in traditional Chinese medicine (1) (7).  It has not been seen alive since 1988 despite aerial surveys in Cambodia in 1994 and subsequent ground surveys in Cambodia Lao PDR and Vietnam (1).  However tracks have been spotted and horns and skulls are still found for sale in Southeast Asia leading many to believe that some koupreys still exist (5) (7).  In addition to hunting habitat loss as a result of agriculture and logging activity is likely to have significantly impacted the kouprey and domestic livestock in the area could have introduced disease into the kouprey population.  Land mines along the borders of Cambodia may also be responsible for kouprey deaths and certainly hinder conservation efforts (1).,The kouprey is legally protected in all range states and may be present in some protected areas.  Prince Sihanouk designated it as the national animal of Cambodia in the 1960s partly due to its mystique (5).  Large mammal surveys continue to take place in Cambodia hoping to re-discover living kouprey. There are no kouprey in animal collections so captive breeding is not currently possible (1). ,loss;hunting;disease; ,captive breeding;protected; ,3,2

Introduced fish species water pollution and over-fishing have all been identified as major threats to the Kunming snow trout. Habitat loss siltation and changes in the access to breeding sites are also important factors in its decline (1).,Although it is not located in a formally protected area two of the springs where the Kunming snow trout occurs are \xe2\x80\x98protected\xe2\x80\x99 by the presence of Buddhist temples.

Animalia,Pristis pristis,Largetooth sawfish (Pristis pristis),Animalia,Chordata,Chondrichthyes,Rajiformes,Pristidae,Pristis (1),c. 500 kg (3),Once common in the Mediterranean and the Eastern Atlantic the largetooth sawfish has now been <strong>extirpated</strong> from the Mediterranean and European waters and populations in Africa are believed to be severely depleted (2). Similarly in Lake Nicaragua where this species used to be abundant the largetooth sawfish barely continues to exist (3). These distressing declines have been largely due to over-fishing and the degradation of important estuarine and freshwater habitats (5). The largetooth sawfish is hunted for its unique and peculiar blade-like snout fins and meat. It is also captured for public aquaria where it is highly prized for exhibits (5). Incidental capture in fisheries also poses a significant threat as its toothed saw makes this fish especially prone to getting entangled in fishing nets (2) (5). Characteristics of the sawfish\xe2\x80\x99s life history such as slow growth rate poor rate of reproduction and high age of maturity make the largetooth sawfish extremely vulnerable to over-exploitation and unable to easily recover from low numbers (5).,The largetooth sawfish is listed on Appendix I of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) meaning that international trade in this species is prohibited except in exceptional circumstances (4). Besides this listing there are currently no conservation measures in place for this species and it is believed that without urgent intervention there is a high probability that the largetooth sawfish will become extinct (2). ,fishing; ,cites; ,1,1

Laysan teal,Anas laysanensis,Laysan duck (Anas laysanensis),Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Anseriformes,Anatidae,Anas (1),Length: 41 cm (2),The limited range and small single population of the Laysan duck is the greatest ultimate threat to this species\xe2\x80\x99 survival at present as it makes it is extremely vulnerable to chance events such as disease or severe weather (4).  Introduced species are a potential threat to the species persistence; while mammalian predators are not currently a problem on Laysan Island there is nothing to prevent an accidental introduction and there are no measures in place to deal with the event should it occur (6).  Many non-native <strong>invertebrates</strong> have arrived on Laysan and while not all are impacting the Laysan duck some (such as ants) are possibly affecting the Laysan duck\xe2\x80\x99s food supply as they compete for their terrestrial prey (4).  An introduced grass <i>Cenchrus echinatus</i> encroached on the native bunchgrass (<i>Eragrostis variabilis</i>) on Laysan Island reducing important breeding habitat but this noxious weed was thankfully eradicated from the island (13).  Infection with the parasitic nematode worm <i>Echinuria uncinata</i> is causing problems for the Laysan duck\xe2\x80\x99s precariously small population (2) and global sea level rise poses a constant threat to all species on the low-lying island of Laysan (4).,The Laysan duck is listed under Appendix I of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) and so international trade in this species is under tight control (3). Furthermore Laysan Island and Midway Atoll are under the protection of the United States Fish and Wildlife Service as they are both National Wildlife Refuges (14) and whilst there are no measures to prevent an accidental species introduction (for example via a ship wreck or unauthorised landing) Laysan Island has a quarantine for authorised visitors (6).  Conservation action that has taken place to date includes the eradication of the introduced grass <i>Cenchrus echinatus</i> (13) as well as the control of other alien plant species that threaten Laysan\xe2\x80\x99s wetlands (<i>Pluchea indica</i>) on Laysan Island and the successful <strong>translocation</strong> of wild Laysan Ducks to Midway Atoll National Wildlife Refuge.  The translocated ducks have bred successfully creating an \xe2\x80\x98insurance\xe2\x80\x99 population which will reduce the chances of a catastrophic event wiping out the entire species since it is unlikely that a disaster would strike two islands simultaneously (15). ,disease;pet; ,cites; ,2,1
leaf-scaled seasnake,Aipysurus foliosquama,Leaf-scaled sea snake (Aipysurus foliosquama),Animalia,Chordata,Reptilia,Squamata,Elapidae,Aipysurus (1),up to 500 g (3),In the 1990s the leaf-scaled sea snake used to comprise about 50 percent of the sea snakes commonly recorded on its native <strong>reef flats</strong> with its population numbers estimated at between 4000 and 9000. However intensive surveys have failed to record a single individual since 2001 (1).,The leaf-scaled sea snake used to be the most common sea snake species encountered on the <strong>reef flat</strong> at Ashmore Reef (2). However despite it being a nature reserve since 1983 (1) sightings in this particular area have not been reported since 2001 (2). Illegal fishing on the reef has been monitored at various levels since 1983 although protection of marine life in the area was not actively enforced until 1998. Unfortunately none of the implemented habitat management plans are specifically targeted towards conserving the leaf-scaled sea snake and it is unclear how or to what extent these measures are reducing the current threats to this species (1). , ,protected; ,0,1

This is expected to affect this species through habitat loss physiological changes and loss of prey (13).\xa0,The leatherback turtle is protected throughout most of its range (1) and international trade in the leatherback turtle and products is banned under Appendix I of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) (3). Many conservation projects have been set up on leatherback turtle nesting beaches with specific management protocols tailored to each location. The attachment of Turtle Excluding Devices (TEDs) to shrimp nets can help prevent the accidental capture of turtles (<strong>bycatch</strong>) and the US government has recently set up Leatherback Conservation Areas in the north Pacific that are off-limits to long-line fisheries during certain times of the year (12).\xa0 ,loss; ,cites;protected; ,1,2

In Tahiti in particular the invasive South American tree <i>Miconia calvescens</i> has displaced as much as 70 percent of the island\xe2\x80\x99s native vegetation (5). The dense stands formed by this vigorous species severely limit the regenerative ability of the smaller understorey plants by preventing their seedlings from receiving sufficient sunlight. It is reported that in forest dominated by <i>Miconia calvescens </i>on Tahiti seedlings comprise only 7 percent of the <i>Lepenia taitensis</i> population compared with 60 percent in intact native forest on Moorea (4).,As a direct threat to the survival of a large number of French Polynesia\xe2\x80\x99s endemic plants (4) considerable effort is being made to develop an efficient means of controlling the spread of <i>Miconia calvescens</i> (5). Thus far a biological control programme initiated in Tahiti in 2000 has been of limited success (5). ,invasive; , ,1,0

Currently the greatest threat appears to be the loss of its habitat. As human populations in the region rise largely due to the immigration of people from nearby areas hit by drought or tribal conflict more land is converted to permanent agriculture (4) destroying the grassland required by the lark. Between 1973 and 2002 suitable grassland habitat in the area declined by about 30 percent and in recent years more has been lost to the rapid encroachment of shrubs (4). Excessive grazing pressure and the suppression of natural seasonal fires has created favourable conditions for the encroaching shrubs (4). Finally a watering point has been developed in the centre of the Liben lark\xe2\x80\x99s range leading to an increase in livestock in the area which impacts the Liben lark through disturbance overgrazing and trampling (4).,In 2007 an expedition took place to investigate the status of the\xa0Liben lark (4) but otherwise conservation action for this Critically Endangered bird is lacking. A number of conservation measures have been recommended by the global bird conservation organisation BirdLife including further surveys and research investigations to determine what causes bushes to encroach on grassland and ascertaining the best way to protect areas of the Liben lark\xe2\x80\x99s habitat from further degradation and disturbance (4). In 2009 the IUCN upgraded the Liben lark from Endangered to Critically Endangered in light of the threats to the tiny population and it is feared that there is a real possibility of the species becoming extinct in the next few years (4). ,loss; , ,1,0

In 2000 the population in the Amani Nature Reserve in the East Usambaras was estimated at just 150 to 200 (4) although more recent work suggests this may be a slight underestimate (7). The population in Nilo Nature Reserve East Usambara Mountains which was initially discovered in 1996 (9) is currently being investigated and preliminary data suggest that the entire East Usambara population will be higher than previously thought (12). The population of the Njesi Plateau in Mozambique is unknown but is likely to be small (2) (3) (6).\xa0,A number of conservation efforts are underway in the East Usambaras where the long-billed tailorbird currently occurs in at least two protected areas the Amani Nature Reserve and the Nilo Nature Reserve (2) (3) (9) (11). Projects are underway to increase the amount of forest in protected areas and the Amani Nature Reserve in particular has an active conservation programme (3) (5). Additional conservation actions for the species include a population monitoring programme extensive field surveys educational programmes and the recording and monitoring of every known tailorbird <strong>territory</strong> (3).

At that time chinchilla populations were flourishing but their pelts were the most valuable in the world reaching up to $100000 for one alone and soon they faced extinction in the wild (5). There are currently an estimated 10000 individuals left in the Chilean mountains (6) (7). More recently populations have also suffered due to habitat destruction by the burning and harvesting of the algarobilla shrub at lower altitudes (7).,Chinchilla are protected by law in their natural habitat but it is extremely hard to monitor hunting in the remote mountain ranges of the Andes and illegal hunting does continue in some areas (6) (7). For the same reason it is also difficult to monitor the population. Recent estimates suggest this species is becoming more isolated following habitat loss and therefore less likely to be able to recover without human intervention. Reintroductions have not worked in the past though breeding is still successful in captivity and hundreds of chinchilla are bred commercially for the pet trade (2). It is hoped that conservation measures will be applied successfully to protect this species and bring it back from the brink of extinction in the wild (5). , ,protected; ,0,1

It is also caught and exported illegally from Madagascar to Asia for the traditional medicine market. Furthermore land development on Madagascar is a serious threat to this turtle as it destroys its natural habitats. Clearing forests for agriculture and timber opens up Madagascar\xe2\x80\x99s untouched habitat and leads to terrible erosion. Subsequent siltation of rivers and lakes renders the turtles even more susceptible to trapping (5).,The Madagascar big-headed turtle is protected from international trade by its listing on Appendix II of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) (3). In May 2003 the Turtle Conservation Fund (TCF) released the first ever list of the world\xe2\x80\x99s top 25 endangered turtles which included the Madagascar big-headed turtle (5). The TCF intends to cover a five year \xe2\x80\x98Global Action Plan\xe2\x80\x99 that includes captive breeding and reintroduction projects trade monitoring and establishment of rescue centres local conservation plans and educational programs (5). The Durrell Wildlife Conservation Trust is also independently involved in the conservation and protection of this species (9). It is hoped that these measures will provide the protection that this species needs to survive in its natural habitat. , ,cites;captive breeding;protected; ,0,3

However the species' small population size and fragmented distribution still leaves it vulnerable to extinction risks. Potential threats to the species' survival include habitat degradation and direct and indirect human persecution (9). Additionally the effects of behavioural traits such as poor juvenile dispersal (13) and incestuous matings (2) (14) may lead to problems of <strong>inbreeding depression</strong> (3).,The Madagascar fish-eagle is protected by its listing on Appendix II of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) (5). In 1998 Madagascar became a signatory to the International Ramsar Convention on Wetlands and a complex of four lakes in the Antsalova region were designated as a site of Wetlands of International Importance (15). These sites (known as the Manambolomaty Complex) support\xa0ten percent\xa0of the world population of Madagascar fish-eagles (9). In addition the Peregrine Fund has initiated a Madagascar Fish Eagle Conservation Programme (16) enabling detailed studies of this species as well as the initiation of a sustainability project for the local people who share their natural resources with the fish-eagles. , ,cites;protected; ,0,2

The last observation at Alaotra was in 1960 and the last anywhere in 1970 until in 1991 a lone male was captured at Alaotra (11) and kept in captivity until its death a year later (2) (3) (4) (5) (7) (9). Intensive searches and publicity campaigns during the 1990s failed to find any more birds (4) (7) (9) and the Madagascar pochard was feared extinct until the rediscovery of 25 individuals at a new site in 2006 (4) (7).,Lake Alaotra was declared a Ramsar Wetland of International Importance in 2003 (15) and efforts have been underway at the site to conserve and restore the last remnants of unmodified habitat which should also benefit other threatened species. Other conservation measures have included education and awareness programmes involving local communities in environmental monitoring and continuing the search for any remaining Madagascar pochards. However the region\xe2\x80\x99s huge economic importance for agriculture and fisheries can make implementing conservation policies difficult (7) (12). It may also be important to establish reserves and prohibit hunting in the area (2) (9). ,fishing;environmental;environment;invasive;pet;pollution; ,captive breeding; ,6,1

The exact cause of this species\xe2\x80\x99 decline is unclear but natural factors such as the <strong>El Ni\xc3\xb1o</strong> cycle introduced species and human activities may all be involved (2). As a result of introduced predators such as black rats cats and the smooth-billed ani preying on eggs and chicks and high levels of nest infestation by the blood sucking parasite <i>Philornis downsi</i> causing the death of nestlings the mangrove finch\xe2\x80\x99s breeding success is low (2). Concerted conservation action is necessary if this species is to be saved from extinction.,For over a decade the Charles Darwin Foundation (CDF) has been working to conserve the mangrove finch (2). At present extensive research is being conducted to better understand this species\xe2\x80\x99 breeding biology and to determine the causes of its decline (2) (5). In the meantime active protection of the remaining breeding populations is being employed through predator and nest parasite control (5). Despite these measures the mangrove finch remains extremely vulnerable due to its limited range. In order to address this the CDF and the Durrell Wildlife Conservation Trust are currently working together towards a captive breeding and <strong>translocation</strong> programme. If successful their efforts will help to ensure a future for this remarkable species (5) (7). , ,captive breeding; ,0,1

Plantae,Weissia multicapsularis,Many-fruited beardless moss (Weissia multicapsularis),Plantae,Bryophyta,Bryopsida,Pottiales,Pottiaceae,Weissia,Height: up to 15 mm,The moss is at risk from several factors. The most threatening is the use of chemicals and fertilisers on arable farmland. The moss risks being 'crowded out' by competing grasses and other larger plants from over enrichment of the soil. <i>Weissia multicapsularis</i> also requires bare ground with the right conditions on which to establish and if this is not available within the range of its spores the moss cannot establish a new colony. Why it fails to <strong>germinate</strong> on some apparently suitable sites is something we know very little about.,The status of this moss is giving conservationists cause for grave concern. Apart from France this moss has only ever been recorded in Britain. As the French population was destroyed by construction work on the only known site in 1997 this species may well be at severe risk of global extinction. <i>Weissia multicapsularis</i> is listed in the UK Biodiversity Action Plans and is one of the threatened mosses on English Nature's Species Recovery Programme. Efforts to save the moss have concentrated on management of the three sites where there are still reasonable sized populations. The work involves maintaining a suitable habitat for the moss including clearing scrub and large over-shading vegetation and weeding by hand around some the bank-top colonies. ,pet; , ,1,0

aga; Guam crow,Corvus kubaryi,Mariana crow (Corvus kubaryi),Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Corvidae,Corvus (1),Length: 38 cm (2),The principal cause of the Mariana crow\xe2\x80\x99s decline on Guam has been predation by the introduced brown tree snake <i>Boiga irregularis</i>. Despite protection of nest sites this has resulted in the near complete extirpation of the species with the exception of a small number of introduced specimens (2). On Rota this species has been seriously affected by a number of threats including: forest clearance for homestead and agricultural development; direct persecution; nest predation by introduced rats and monitor lizards; competition with the introduced bird species <i>Dicrurus macrocercus</i>; and disease (2). In addition recent typhoons have destroyed large areas of forest habitat on Rota and records indicate that brown tree snake individuals have been introduced to the island (1). If the snake establishes a population it is likely to have a catastrophic effect on the Mariana crow\xe2\x80\x99s dwindling population potentially driving it to extinction (1) (2).,The Mariana crow is listed by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service as an endangered species and several conservation measures are in place to preserve its imperilled island populations (2) (5). At present one of the main priorities for the preservation of the Mariana crow is to research and reduce the threat posed by the brown treesnake on both islands including the prevention of further spread to Rota (5). In 1993 a National Wildlife Refuge was established on Guam to preserve the remaining forest and a 40 hectare snake-free area has been created for the introduction of Mariana crows. On Rota a predation control experiment is to be initiated and there are plans to extend the coverage of the island\xe2\x80\x99s protected areas under the Habitat Conservation Plan for Rota's Agricultural Homesteads (1) (2). In addition to the implementation of measures to reduce the brown treesnake population and to protect remaining habitat it is essential that further research is carried out to assess the population status of the Mariana crow on Rota. This includes detailed research into the relative importance of different factors affecting the species\xe2\x80\x99 survival and reproduction (5). ,disease;pet; ,protected; ,2,1

MÃ¡safuera Rayadito,Aphrastura masafuerae,Masafuera rayadito (Aphrastura masafuerae),Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Furnariidae,Aphrastura (1),Body length: 16 cm (2),Introduced mammals are the biggest threat to this species causing damage to its sheltered habitats and increasing predation. Goats and rabbits brought to the island the Juan Fern\xc3\xa1ndez archipelago graze and trample vegetation creating large areas that are dangerously exposed for the birds (5). Introduced rats mice and feral cats all probably prey on this species posing a threat to the eggs chicks and adults (2). The only native predator of the Masafuera rayadito on Alejandro Selkirk the red-backed (or Masafuera) hawk (<em>Buteo polyosoma</em>) has increased in numbers since hunting it became illegal and following an increase of introduced mice and rats on which it can feed (6).,Despite recognition of the Juan Fern\xc3\xa1ndez Islands as an important area for wildlife (they are now a National Park and Endemic Bird Area) (5) population numbers of the Masafuera rayadito may still be declining. Conservation measures have included removing sheep from the island in 1983 and sporadic goat control programmes from 1998 until 2003. Proposed measures prioritise the eradication of introduced mammal species including goats rats and cats (2) (3) and this must be followed by preventing the introduction of any new alien species (5). Increased monitoring and understanding of the ecology and threats to this bird will improve conservation efforts and comparisons with related species such as the thorn-tailed rayadito (<em>Aphrastura spinicauda</em>) and other <strong>endemic</strong> species of the archipelago may help (2) (3). ,hunting; , ,1,0

Although it occupies all suitable areas it has a low population density with the total population currently numbering just 500 individuals (4). The population density is thought to be constrained by food availability which has been reduced as a result of the habitat damage caused by feral pigs. Habitat degradation elsewhere appears to exacerbate the effects of heavy rainfall which may have an effect on nest failure (7).,The Hawaiian Division of Forestry and Wildlife implemented a five year recovery plan for the Maui parrotbill in 2003 which aims to protect existing habitat continue research into the ecology of the species and the threats it faces restore potential habitat and run a captive breeding programme for release of Maui parrotbills into this newly restored habitat (7). ,disease; ,captive breeding; ,1,1
Zosterops chloronothos,Zosterops chloronothus,Mauritius olive white-eye (Zosterops chloronothus),Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Zosteropidae,Zosterops (1),Length: 10 cm (2),Like many native species on Mauritius the Mauritius olive white-eye has been badly affected by habitat loss and by predation by introduced mammals. The species has a very small range and its habitat is continuing to decline in extent and quality compounding the major threat of nest predation. As a result the Mauritius olive white-eye population has declined drastically since the mid-1970s from around 350 pairs to only 100 or so in 2001 (2) (3) (6). In addition the extremely low reproductive success recorded in recent years is of critical concern (7). With such a small population the species is also particularly vulnerable to extinction from extreme events such as cyclones.,The Mauritius olive white-eye is protected by law and part of its range occurs within the Black River National Park. There are also plans to purchase habitat around Bassin Blanc (2). In 2005 a species recovery programme was initiated by the Mauritian Wildlife Foundation with the aim of increasing knowledge of the Mauritius olive white-eye and its threats and to investigate management techniques. Since then an intensive management plan has been applied to the species involving monitoring of the wild population undertaking predator control at nest sites rescue and harvest of wild nests artificial incubation and hand-rearing of offspring. However it is thought that effective habitat management and releases onto predator-free islets are more viable options than captive breeding (2) (6). ,loss; ,captive breeding;protected; ,1,2

McCordâs box turtle,Cuora mccordi,Mccordâs box turtle (Cuora mccordi),Animalia,Chordata,Reptilia,Testudines,Bataguridae,Cuora (1),Maximum carapace length: 13.4 â 16.5 cm (2),Like many of Asia\xe2\x80\x99s turtle species Mccord\xe2\x80\x99s box turtles are dangerously close to extinction because they are being over exploited by the Asian turtle trade for meat and traditional medicine (4). In addition the turtle has suffered from capture for the western pet market and from habitat loss and degradation. The species has become increasingly scarce within the Chinese food markets indicating that populations in the wild are declining. Furthermore the extremely high prices paid in the western pet market by turtle enthusiasts with individuals reaching up to US$ 2000 signifies the rarity and difficulty of obtaining these animals (2). It has been estimated that perhaps no more than 350 specimens remain possibly considerably fewer all within private or zoo collections (6). Although no direct studies have been made it is assumed that this species\xe2\x80\x99 habitat must have been drastically affected by the large-scale deforestation experienced within southwest China. Additionally pollution is a major problem in the area\xe2\x80\x99s waterways. Indeed the China Environment Report ranks China as the highest producer of sulphur dioxide in the world with Guangxi and Guangdong belonging to the areas most affected by acid rain (2).,As a native Chinese species Mccord\xe2\x80\x99s box turtle is protected by the Wildlife Protection Law of 1988 which requires that capture transport and trade in wild animals is by official permit only. China\xe2\x80\x99s National Environmental Protection Agency (1998) has recommended that the species be listed as \xe2\x80\x98major protected wildlife\xe2\x80\x99 in order to prohibit capture and trade completely. This would help the survival of this critically endangered turtle but only if such laws could viably be enforced something that is notoriously difficult. Over 51 nature reserves and two \xe2\x80\x98scenic areas\xe2\x80\x99 have been established in Guangxi where Mccord\xe2\x80\x99s box turtle may occur but quantitative surveys of the species\xe2\x80\x99 population size and distribution are needed to better determine the benefits of these protected areas for the species (2). The current outlook for Mccord\xe2\x80\x99s box turtle in the wild is pretty grim but the species\xe2\x80\x99 prospects for continuing survival are nevertheless hopeful largely due to its ability to adapt well to captivity and successfully reproduce (6). However there have been no plans for releasing captive-bred individuals into the wild and until the current climate of the Asian turtle trade western pet market and ongoing habitat destruction change it would seem unsafe to do so. Until such time captive-bred individuals can serve to buffer against total extinction but nevertheless remain a poor substitute for a self-sustainable population in the wild where this turtle belongs. ,loss;environment;pet;pollution; ,protection law;protected; ,4,2
Phoque-moine MÃ©diterranÃ©en,Monachus monachus,Mediterranean monk seal (Monachus monachus),Animalia,Chordata,Mammalia,Carnivora,Phocidae,Monachus (1),Length of male: 240 cm (2)Length of female: 238 cm (2)Weight of male: 315 kg (2)Weight of female: 300 kg (2),Mediterranean monk seals are highly sensitive to disturbance and humans have extensively used both the sea and beaches of their habitat for centuries causing the population to collapse (2). The main threats facing this species are deliberate killing by fishermen who perceive the species as a competitor for fish entanglement in fishing gear disturbance and habitat loss through development and tourism disease and the effects of toxic algal blooms (2). In 1997 two thirds of the seals in the largest population located at Cap Blanc Mauritania were lost due to the accumulation of toxins in fish following an algal bloom (5) (10). These shy creatures have taken to hauling out in caves to give birth rather than on developed beaches and the collapse of such caves is a further threat to the survival of the species (2).,The IUCN Species Survival Commission Seal Specialist Group has devised an Action Plan for the conservation of the species the aims of which include the involvement of local fishermen research into the status of the species and the development of a captive breeding programme (7). A Greek National Programme for the Protection of the Monk Seal has been established aiming to prevent human-induced mortalities of the species and to restore and maintain a viable self-supporting population (6). Some experts believe that the removal of pups from a population to supply a captive programme could severely affect breeding within the wild population and injure the pups concerned (7). Captive breeding is usually recommended for mammal species of such low numbers as this and with threats continuing in the wild but concerns that removing young seals from the wild will not severely affect breeding in the wild and will not injure or negatively affect survival of the captured young must be adequately addressed (11). It is clear that determined action is urgently required if this reclusive beleaguered species is to escape total extinction. ,loss;fishing;disease;pet; ,captive breeding; ,4,1
Animalia,Camarhynchus pauper,Medium tree-finch (Camarhynchus pauper),Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Emberizidae,Camarhynchus (1),Length: 12.5 cm (2),The medium tree-finch used to be found on the coast but is now restricted to the highlands (4) as a result of the extensive habitat destruction and degradation on Floreana caused by agriculture and free-ranging livestock. Introduced predators such as cats dogs and rats also pose a threat (2). The introduction of diseases such as avian pox may also potentially threaten finches. A population of the large ground finch has already become extinct on Floreana which illustrates the vulnerability of finch species to such threats.,The majority of the Galapagos archipelago forms part of the Galapagos National Park a World Heritage Site. A management plan is in place for the islands and the Ecuadorian government and non-governmental organisations are working to conserve the unique biodiversity of the Galapagos (5) all of which will help ensure the future of this species. More specifically scientists at the Charles Darwin Research Station are working to improve our understanding of Darwin\xe2\x80\x99s finches to ensure their conservation. This includes monitoring of populations and investigating introduced diseases (3). However in 2009 the IUCN upgraded the medium tree-finch from Vulnerable to Critically Endangered in light of its tiny range on a small island and indications of a rapid decline in the species due to the effects of a parasite <i>Philornis downsi</i> (2). ,disease; , ,1,0

Not only does this logging result in a reduced area for the macaques to live but it also destabilises the local ecosystem causing water levels in the forest rivers to fluctuate much more extensively than in the past. The alternating flooding and very low water levels has also caused an increase in malarial mosquitoes (7).,The Mentawai Islands are of high conservation significance as they are home to an unusually high number of <strong>endemic</strong> species and <strong>subspecies</strong> (8) and are part of the Sundaland Biodiversity Hotspot (7).  Although 18 percent of the Mentawai Islands lies within three major protected areas (5) unfortunately the Mentawai macaque is not found in any protected area (1). ,hunting;pet; ,protected; ,2,1

On Raivave the species\xe2\x80\x99 population is in a critical state while the tiny population on Henderson Island is thought to consist of fewer than six adult plants (1) (6). Like many other floral species on these isolated islands <em>Meryta brachypoda</em> is highly vulnerable to competition for natural resources with introduced exotic species and on Tubai the fruit tree <em>Psidium cattleianum </em>is a particularly problematic non-native species. On Henderson Island natural habitats are threatened by coconut planting and the unsustainable harvesting of certain tree species for timber by neighbouring Pitcairn Islanders (2) (7).,Facing the very real threat of extinction the survival of <em>Meryta brachypoda</em> may be dependant on the implementation of major conservation measures. The development of <strong>ex-situ</strong> conservation measures is deemed a priority for this species while introducing it to new areas of the islands it inhabits is a possibility. Visitors to Henderson Island should also be encouraged to limit coconut planning and measures must be taken to prevent the further introduction of exotic species (2). \xa0 ,pet; , ,1,0

Populations in the remaining small forest patches continue to face intense pressure from deforestation and trapping (2).  In addition the beautifully patterned plumage of the Mindoro bleeding-heart makes it a target for trapping for domestic and export pet trade (2) and it is also hunted for food (3).,The Mindoro bleeding-heart was last recorded in 1991 in Sablayan the largest remaining patch of lowland forest but there have been more recent unconfirmed reports by local people from two other areas (5).  It may be afforded a little protection in the Mount Iglit-Baco National Park and hunting has been prohibited around Mount Malasimbo (3).  Thorough surveys of all these areas are urgently needed to clarify the Mindoro bleeding-heart\xe2\x80\x99s current distribution and if any surviving populations are discovered studies to determine its ecological requirements would help inform conservation actions (3) (5).  The protection of two key sites at which the bleeding-heart is believed to occur Mount Halcon and Lake Naujan is also likely to benefit this critically endangered bird (3). ,pet; , ,1,0

Autillo de Moheli,Otus moheliensis,Moheli scops-owl (Otus moheliensis),Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Strigiformes,Strigidae,Otus (1),Length: 20 â 22Â cm (2),The loss of forest on Moh\xc3\xa9li has been severe; in 1995 only five percent of the island still had intact dense humid forest. Underplanting is one of the main problems affecting the remaining forest a process in which food-producing plants such as bananas are planted within forests where they alter the natural vegetation composition and eventually cause the degradation of the forest habitat. Aside from habitat loss specific threats to the Moheli scops-owl are hunting and <strong>invasive</strong> species such as rats which may eat its eggs and compete with it for food. At present the highland region inhabited by the Moheli scops-owl is entirely unprotected. Estimates made in 2000 indicated that this owl\xe2\x80\x99s total population amounted to just 400 individuals therefore even a small-scale adverse event could result in its extinction (2).,There are no conservation measures currently in place for the Moheli scops-owl. However proposals have been made to protect this species by extending the R\xc3\xa9serve Marine de Nioumachoua so that it includes the highland forest regions that the owl inhabits. With so little known about this species\xe2\x80\x99 biology there is a requirement for further research so that effective protective measures can be developed. Increasing the awareness of Moh\xc3\xa9li\xe2\x80\x99s inhabitants about the existence of the Moheli scops-owl and its rarity would also be beneficial for its conservation (2). ,loss;hunting;invasive;pet; , ,4,0

Hot ash gases and rocks destroyed trees blocked rivers and caused flash floods destroying much vegetation. This habitat loss has since been compounded by encroaching agriculture which has cleared much original forest particularly on the Silver Hills in northern Montserrat. <strong>Feral</strong> animals such as pigs and rats have also degraded areas of native vegetation and destroyed seedlings while invasive floral species such as the purple allamanda (<em>Cryptostegia madagascariensis</em>) are smothering native plants (2) (4) (6). As a result of these widespread threats the Montserrat orchid is now rare and has a very restricted distribution (5)<warehouse:ref entitytype="ScientificReference">.</warehouse:ref><warehouse:ref entitytype="ScientificReference"></warehouse:ref>,With over 800 native plant species Montserrat is one of the richest of all the UK Overseas Territories in terms of its plant diversity. The UK Overseas Territories Team at the Royal Botanic Gardens Kew has been involved in conservation projects there since 1998. Once such project entitled 'Enabling the people of Montserrat to conserve the Centre Hills' collected specimens and habitat information and assessed the plant diversity of an area relatively undamaged by volcanic eruptions. An additional project focused more closely on the islands two <strong>endemic</strong> species: the Montserrat orchid and the pribby (<em>Rondeletia buxifolia</em>). Two collections of Montserrat orchid seeds are now stored in Kew\xe2\x80\x99s Millennium Seed Bank. Living Montserrat orchids rescued from dead mango trees have also been taken to the Montserrat National Trust\xe2\x80\x99s botanic garden where they are being cultivated for future display (2). ,loss;invasive; , ,2,0
Animalia,Icterus oberi,Montserrat oriole (Icterus oberi),Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Icteridae,Icterus (1),Length: 20 - 22 cm (2),Confined to hill forests on the small island of Montserrat the Montserrat oriole is believed to have formerly had a total range of around 30 square kilometres (7). However volcanic eruptions between 1995 and 1997 destroyed around two-thirds of its habitat all but removing this species from the Soufri\xc3\xa8re and South Soufri\xc3\xa8re hills and largely restricting it to just the Centre Hills. Initial surveys suggested that much of the population had survived the eruptions with healthy numbers remaining in the Centre Hills and a smaller relict population in the South Soufri\xc3\xa8re hills. But between 1997 and 2003 the population declined very rapidly (2) (3). The exact cause of this decline is unknown but potential agents include ash fall on the forest causing insect availability to decrease or chronic ill health of birds (2).\xa0,Since the devastating volcanic eruption that almost caused the extinction of this striking species the Montserrat oriole has been the target of much research and management. In June 1999 eight birds were taken to Jersey Zoo to enable the development of husbandry techniques. Initial attempts at captive breeding proved successful and captive birds are now also present at several other locations in the UK (2).\xa0 , ,captive breeding;protected; ,0,2

All species in the <em>Euastacus</em> <strong>genus</strong> are designated as \xe2\x80\x98no take\xe2\x80\x99 species in Queensland under the Fisheries Act 1994 and must be released if captured (1) (2). ,loss; , ,1,0
Dominican white-lipped frog; giant ditch frog,Leptodactylus fallax,Mountain chicken (Leptodactylus fallax),Animalia,Chordata,Amphibia,Anura,Leptodactylidae,Leptodactylus (1),c. 700 g (3),An unfortunate victim of hunting disease natural disasters and habitat loss the mountain chicken population has recently undergone catastrophic declines estimated at around 80 percent since 1995 (1) (2). On Dominica this Critically Endangered frog is favoured for its meaty legs which are cooked in traditional West Indian dishes and which are in fact the country\xe2\x80\x99s national dish (6). Annual harvests were thought to be taking between 8000 and 36000 animals before a ban on hunting was introduced and as a result of this exploitation the population on the island is thought to be near extinction (1).,Hunting of the mountain chicken was banned on Dominica in the late 1990s although a three month open season was declared at the end of 2001 and hunting was not fully prohibited until 2003 (1) (3). Public awareness programmes have also been implemented to inform the Dominican public of the threats the mountain chicken faces and to try to discourage hunting (1). \xa0 ,loss;hunting;disease; ,captive breeding; ,3,1

A further threat comes from habitat loss caused by increased temperatures and decreasing snow cover as a result of global warming while predation by the red fox (<em>Vulpes vulpes</em>) and feral cats is also a problem\xa0(1)\xa0(2)\xa0(3)\xa0(4). Bushfires in 2003 damaged large areas of habitat\xa0(2) and the mountain pygmy-possum\xe2\x80\x99s main prey the Bogong moth also faces a number of threats including pesticide use in its breeding grounds\xa0(2)\xa0(3). The mountain pygmy-possum occupies just a tiny area estimated at less than seven square kilometres and its populations are highly fragmented putting it at particular risk\xa0(1)\xa0(4).,The entire range of the mountain pygmy-possum occurs within protected areas although important parts of these are in ski-resort lease areas. Management plans for the species have been put in place in Victoria and New South Wales and a national recovery plan is currently being prepared\xa0(1). A range of conservation measures have been recommended for this small possum including protection and restoration of the remaining habitat population and habitat monitoring predator control measures to protect the possums in ski resorts further research and captive breeding programmes\xa0(1)\xa0(3)\xa0(4). ,loss; ,captive breeding;protected; ,1,2

Mlanje cedar; Mlanje cypress; Mulanje cedarwood,Widdringtonia whytei,Mulanje cedar (Widdringtonia whytei),Plantae,Tracheophyta,Coniferopsida,Coniferales,Cupressaceae,Widdringtonia (1),Height: 42.7 m (2)Trunk diameter: 1.5 m (2),The Mulanje cedar has been heavily exploited in the past (3) (5) (9) with its wood used as timber and its sawdust distilled to obtain oil for local use as an insecticide (3) (5) (10). The wood is considered enormously valuable being very fragrant and resistant to termites borers and fungal disease. It is used locally for making carvings boxes and furniture sold to tourists and is also sold abroad for light construction and flooring. The timber is thought to be particularly good for boat-building to the point that fishery officials have urged that remaining supplies be reserved for the Lake Malawi fishing industry. The Forestry Department of Malawi have recently agreed to supply Mulanje Cedar to build 450 boats for this purpose (11). The tree\xe2\x80\x99s decline has been somewhat stemmed by a ban on felling allowing exploitation only of dead trees but illegal felling and killing of trees continues at an alarming rate. The Mulanje Mountain Forest Reserve is also generally threatened by encroachment and large-scale development such as the continual threat of bauxite mining. Additionally there is concern that mature individuals appear to be dying at a high rate thought possibly to be due to their high sensitivity to forest fires and susceptibility to attacks by a species of aphid (3). Regeneration on the other hand seems to depend on fire and is extremely poor. In addition <i>Pinus patula</i> (originally a commercial plantation species) has invaded a number of areas suitable for <i>Widdringtonia</i> colonisation (5) (9). All these threats have greatly impacted the Mulanje cedar; a 2007 study found that the remaining Mulanje cedar forests had been reduced by 40 percent over the previous 15 years (3). Out of the remaining 845.3 hectares of forest identified over 32 percent of standing Mulanje cedar was found to be dead (3). As so much dead wood is available for utilisation there should be no reason to cut live Mulanje cedar (3).,All Mulanje cedars are protected within the Mulanje Mountain Forest Reserve and licences are available now only for the exploitation of dead trees from the Forestry Department of Malawi (3) (9). The Mulanje Mountain Conservation Trust has also been set up to provide long-term support for the research and conservation of biological diversity in the Mulanje Mountain Forest Reserve and the sustainable utilisation of its natural resources. The Trust is working with the Forestry Department of Malawi in bringing in community participation to manage the resources of the forest reserve and maximise the benefits among resource users (12). Not only is the Mulanje cedar a national emblem to Malawi but it is also of critical financial importance to this relatively poor country and as such its protection and sustainable use is a national priority (6). ,fishing;disease; ,protected; ,2,1
Munchique wood wren,Henicorhina negreti,Munchique wood-wren (Henicorhina negreti),Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Troglodytidae,Henicorhina (1),15.2 - 16.7 g (2),Due to its extremely small range and population which is known to be in decline the Munchique wood-wren is currently at high risk of extinction (3). However it has been argued that its classification of Critically Endangered (CR) on the IUCN Red List should be changed as a result of the discovery of another population in southern Antioquia (4).,There are no specific conservation measures currently known to be in place for this species but much of the Munchique wood-wren\xe2\x80\x99s range is in protected areas such as the Munchique National Park and Tambito Nature Reserve. Sadly deforestation continues to occur despite the high numbers of endangered species living in these areas. The budget for conservation is low and increased government spending is not thought to be likely due to current civil conflicts in Colombia (2). ,pet; ,protected; ,1,1

Animalia,Biswamoyopterus biswasi,Namdapha flying squirrel (Biswamoyopterus biswasi),Animalia,Chordata,Mammalia,Rodentia,Sciuridae,Biswamoyopterus (1),Head-body length: 405 mm (2),This little-known flying squirrel has a very restricted range and is currently known from only one location (1). Like other restricted-range species this makes it particularly vulnerable to any threats which could rapidly affect all individuals in the population. The Namdapha flying squirrel is presently threatened by habitat loss and degradation (1) caused by clear-felling for human settlements shifting agriculture and the extraction of non-timber forest products particularly the leaves of a rattan palm <i>Zalacca secunda</i> for use as a roofing material (5).,The Namdapha flying squirrel occurs within Namdapha National Park in Arunachal Pradesh (4). Despite the protection of this large area it is still affected by human activities such as those mentioned above. The Namdapha National Park contains not only the Critically Endangered Namdapha flying squirrel but is also home to populations of other threatened species including tigers (<i>Panthera tigris</i>) snow leopards (<i>Uncia unicia</i>) and Asian elephants (<i>Elephas maximus</i>). The effective protection of the Namdapha National Park is therefore incredibly important but this is also an incredibly difficult aim to achieve. This is not only due to the park\xe2\x80\x99s inaccessibility the lack of legal enforcement and shortage of well-trained and equipped personnel but also due to the local people\xe2\x80\x99s dependence on the forest and the materials it provides. This means that any conservation measures require local people\xe2\x80\x99s participation to be successful (5). ,loss; , ,1,0

Entre Rios seedeater,Sporophila zelichi,Naroskyâs seedeater (Sporophila zelichi),Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Emberizidae,Sporophila (1),Length: 10 cm (2),A favourite of bird trappers Narosky\xe2\x80\x99s seedeater cannot afford to lose many more individuals to the pet trade. Its existence is also threatened by rapid afforestation with <i>Eucalyptus</i> and <i>Pinus</i> species for logging operations as well as pesticide pollution from drainage and run-off into marshes (2). Continuous over-grazing by livestock and the conversion of suitable habitat into agricultural land add to the need for protected areas to ensure the survival of this species (4).,Narosky\xe2\x80\x99s seedeater has been reported in two national parks in Argentina and a biosphere reserve in Uruguay. However law enforcement is weak and this does not guarantee the persistence of the species in these areas. Proposals to prevent the extinction of Narosky\xe2\x80\x99s seedeater include surveying south Paraguay for breeding populations monitoring known populations developing an action plan removing the incentives for afforestation of grasslands protection of breeding grounds and prohibiting the trapping and keeping of this bird in captivity (2). ,pet;pollution; , ,2,0

Animalia,Gallicolumba keayi,Negros bleeding-heart (Gallicolumba keayi),Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Columbiformes,Columbidae,Gallicolumba (1),Size: 30 cm (2),Like the four other bleeding-heart species that occur in the Philippines the Negros bleeding-heart is greatly threatened by the destruction of its habitat.  In 1988 only four percent of forest cover remained on Negros and Panay held on to just eight percent of its forest.  This alarming loss is due to the clearance of forest for agriculture timber and charcoal-burning and these activities remain a serious threat to the remaining fragments of forest.  The effect of this devastating habitat destruction is aggravated by local trapping and hunting of the Negros bleeding-heart for food and presumably for the cage-bird trade (1).  As a result of these threats the extremely small population of Negros bleeding-hearts (estimated to be between 50 and 249 individuals) is still declining (4) which makes it extremely vulnerable to extinction.,Despite the precarious status of the Negros bleeding-heart there are very few specific conservation measures in place.  It occurs within the Mount Canlaon Natural Park on Negros and possibly also in the North Negros Forest Reserve.  However the North Negros Forest Reserve receives virtually no protection at present (7).  On Panay it occurs in the North West Panay Peninsula which was proclaimed a Protected Area in 2001.  Forest Rangers of the Philippine Endemic Species Conservation Project (PESCP) patrol this area and the northern part of the Central Panay Mountain Range destroying snares and curbing illegal logging.  PESCP also ran an Airgun-for-Rice programme as an intervention against hunting in the region; a large number of airguns were destroyed as a result of the programme (5) (10). ,loss;hunting; ,captive breeding;protected; ,2,2

Animalia,Himantopus novaezelandiae,New Zealand black stilt (Himantopus novaezelandiae),Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Charadriiformes,Recurvirostridae,Himantopus (1),220 g (2),The massive decline and retraction in range of the black stilt is mainly attributed to the introduction of mammalian predators to New Zealand such as cats ferrets and stoats (6). In the Mackenzie Basin ongoing large-scale rabbit control programmes since the 1940s may have forced feral cats to switch to hunting native birds instead (3). Habitat modification has also contributed to the decline of this species (1); a massive hydroelectric scheme in the basin has considerably altered the natural habitat (7). Today mammalian predators still represent the major threat to the continued survival of this species along with <strong>hybridisation</strong> with the closely related Australasian pied stilt which successfully colonised New Zealand subsequent to European settlement in the 1800's (6). Since the 1970's the small remnant breeding population of black stilts has been restricted in range to the Mackenzie Basin where it has been intensively protected and managed (5). If numbers continue to fall <strong>hybridisation</strong> will become an even bigger problem as individuals find it harder to find mates within their own species.,Since the mid-1900's pure black stilts have numbered fewer than 100 individuals; in 1999 numbers fell as low as 40 only 9 of which were females (6). Since the 1970's intensive predator control protection and manipulation of wild nests and captive breeding and release programmes have been the only factors preventing this species from becoming extinct in the wild (5). The New Zealand Department of Conservation set out a new Kak\xc3\xaf Recovery Plan in 2001 (3) in a concerted effort to save this species. Phase one of the plan aims to increase numbers in the wild through captive rearing and release programmes along with predator control measures (3). The second phase of the Recovery Plan aims to identify the causes of breeding failure in the wild (3). Recent improvements in release techniques have increased the initial survival of released birds to as much as 80 to 100 percent and these are encouraging results (6) although factors that inhibit recovery remain. ,hunting; ,captive breeding; ,1,1

Human impact through habitat destruction and the use of harmful insecticides (such as <strong>DDT</strong>) combined with natural factors such as volcanic activity and widespread fires are thought to be partially responsible (4) (5) (6) (9). However the largest impact on the nightingale reed-warbler has been from the introduction of the brown tree snake (<em>Boiga irregularis</em>) believed to be responsible for the warbler\xe2\x80\x99s final extirpation from Guam in 1969 (2) (4).,A great deal of conservation work has been and continues to be undertaken to ensure the survival of this Critically Endangered bird. Currently it is protected by the U.S. Endangered Species Act making it illegal to hunt kill or possess a nightingale reed-warbler or its eggs. Furthermore the wetland habitats where a great number of populations live are protected under the U.S. Clean Water Act and in 1998 a recovery plan for the species was produced by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (4) (11). ,loss; ,protected;endangered species act; ,1,2

Ibis chauve,Geronticus eremita,Northern bald ibis (Geronticus eremita),Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Ciconiiformes,Threskiornithidae,Geronticus (1),Length: 70 - 80 cm (2),The reasons for the long-term decline of this species are poorly understood and may in part be due to natural causes (5). The recent precipitous decline however is almost undoubtedly linked to hunting and persecution disturbance at the breeding sites and the loss of suitable habitat such as <strong>steppe</strong> and unintensive arable land and flooding of foraging areas due to construction of dams and drainage of wetlands (5) (8). Pesticide poisoning has also had disastrous consequences most notably in Turkey in the late 1950s when hundreds were killed outright by DDT (sprayed to kill mosquitoes) with the survivors subsequently suffering very low breeding success (8) (9). In May 1996 40 of the Moroccan birds died in just nine days due to an epidemic of unknown cause demonstrating how vulnerable the small remnant populations are (8).,BirdLife International and the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds (RSPB) have been working alongside local people to research and monitor this enigmatic species. A major step has been to train and manage a team of wardens in Morocco to monitor breeding and roosting sites prevent disturbance by tourists or fishermen collect information and make local people aware of the bird\xe2\x80\x99s significance; these conservation measures have resulted in a recent slight population increase (1) (7).

Habitat alteration and incidental poisoning may also have contributed to the decline (2). The species may now be vulnerable to predation by dingoes and competition with native species for food (5).,Huge efforts have been made to conserve this species (6). In 1971 the Epping Forest National Park was established to protect the last population of northern hairy-nosed wombats and by 1982 cattle had been excluded from the area (10). A recovery plan has been produced; the aims of this plan include the establishment of a captive rearing facility (2) and the creation of a second wild population. Suitable sites for <strong>re-introduction</strong> are currently being identified. The long-term aim of the plan is to establish a network of populations throughout the historic range (5). In 1981 estimates put the population at just 20 to 40 individuals this had risen to 110 in 2000 (11) but there may be as few as 20 breeding females (11) so it is clear that the status of this species is very precarious and that determined long-term conservation efforts are essential if it is to step back from the brink of extinction. ,pet; , ,1,0

The total known population is very low at only 300 to 400 individuals (2) and the largest sub-population recorded has only 157 individuals which severely limits the group\xe2\x80\x99s breeding potential (1). This species is threatened by habitat destruction as it occurs in one of the most populated and industrious region of Brazil (4). Vast tracts of forest have been lost and the remaining healthy forests are fragmented and at risk of being destroyed in the future. In addition these large primates were an important food source for people in the region and have been widely hunted (4).,The muriqui has been a flagship species for the conservation of Brazil\xe2\x80\x99s fragile Atlantic Forest region (8). However information on these critically endangered primates is still lacking and data on population distribution and status is urgently required.

Noguchi's woodpecker; Pryer's woodpecker,Dendrocopos noguchii,Okinawa woodpecker (Dendrocopos noguchii),Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Piciformes,Picidae,Dendrocopos (1),Length: 31 - 35 cm (2),The Okinawa woodpecker requires forest that is at least 30 years of age and a vast amount of suitable habitat on the island has been lost in the past century (2). Logging dam construction road building and agricultural development have all caused losses of prime habitat (3). The species is now restricted to small and fragmented populations that are at inherent risk from chance events such as disease and natural disasters (2).,The Okinawa woodpecker is protected by law in Japan and the area within which it is found was declared a National Park in 1996 (2). Deforestation is continuing to encroach on remaining tracts of pristine habitat however and further action is still needed (2). Some conservation organisations have purchased areas of habitat in an effort to secure the future of this native bird and investigation into the possibility of forest 'corridors' linking protected habitat is required (2). ,loss;disease; ,protected; ,2,1

Hurricane-force winds have recently scoured the Na Pali sea cliffs killing many plants (7). Additionally while most populations are found on virtually inaccessibly sea-cliffs the Waiahuakua population on Kaua\xe2\x80\x99i is more accessible and has suffered damage from the activities of feral goats (6). In the early 1990s Kaua\xe2\x80\x99i had a total of approximately 150 individuals on the Na Pali sea cliffs where today there remain only seven (7). With such critically low numbers there is a concern that genetic variability will get too low as a result of inbreeding between remaining plants for the species to adequately respond to environmental pressures (7) (3). Thus although once fairly common this species is now teetering on the brink of extinction in the wild (8).,Botanists and horticulturists concerned about the plight of Hawaii\xe2\x80\x99s threatened plant species have helped save this fantastic plant from total extinction by pollinating the remaining wild specimens by hand and collecting seeds for propagation (8). Successful germination of the seeds has enabled large numbers of plants to be grown in botanical gardens to be used in a replanting programme (8). Today there are more plants in the Limahuli Gardens and McBride Gardens on Kaua\xe2\x80\x99i than there are in the wild (5)! Endangered species may benefit from increased artificial gene flow especially if they have passed through a genetic bottleneck due to <strong>inbreeding depression</strong> and hand pollination experiments have aided in this respect (7). Investigation into possible alternative pollinators is also being planned (7). Such research will undoubtedly aid the creation of guidelines for the re-introduction of the magnificent \xe2\x80\x98olulu into protected cliff sites where it once flourished (7). ,loss;environmental;environment;invasive;pet; ,protected; ,5,1

Competition with introduced species for both food and nest sites together with predation by red foxes and feral cats have further depleted populations of\xa0orange-bellied parrots\xa0(6).,An Orange-Bellied Parrot Action Plan has been running since 1980 aiming to improve the conservation status of this species so that it is no longer classified as Critically Endangered (2). Populations are regularly monitored and areas of habitat particularly in the winter grounds are protected as reserves (2). The control of predators occurs in some areas and in the moorland habitat of Tasmania controlled burning is used to increase food productivity (2). A captive breeding programme has also been set up to augment wild population numbers and by 1999 72 birds had been released into the wild with some successfully completing the return migration (2). To date the success of the Action Plan has been mixed; some intensively managed populations are showing encouraging increases in numbers whilst others continue to fall (6). There are still fewer than 200 individuals (6) in the wild and intensive conservation work will be vital for the future of this colourful bird. ,loss;pet; ,captive breeding;protected; ,2,2

Hundreds to thousands of minute zebra mussels can attach to the shell of native mussels which can eventually kills the contaminated individual by interfering with its ability to feed respire excrete and move (7).,The orangefoot pimpleback is classified as federally endangered in the United States which gives the species some protection from direct harm (5). The orangefoot pimpleback is also listed on Appendix I of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) (4) meaning that international trade in this species is strictly prohibited without a permit. The United States Fish and Wildlife Service has released several summaries and action plans for the conservation of this freshwater mussel (5) (7) which include surveying areas with known populations and establishing a captive breeding and reintroduction programme (7). ,invasive;pollution; ,cites;captive breeding; ,2,2

Crocodile De L'OrÃ©noque,Crocodylus intermedius,Orinoco crocodile (Crocodylus intermedius),Animalia,Chordata,Reptilia,Crocodylia,Crocodylidae,Crocodylus (1),Male length: up to 5 m (2)Female length: up to 3.2 m (2)Male weight: 380 kg (2)Female weight: 200 kg (2),The Orinoco crocodile was hunted to the brink of extinction for its skin during the 1930s to 60s and the population has shown little signs of recovery since (4) although reintroduction programs are underway. Crocodiles could be found in large numbers around small water areas during the dry season which made them easy targets for hunters (2). Today there are an estimated 250 to 1500 individuals left in the wild (2). Illegal hunting for meat and for teeth (which are thought to have medicinal properties) along with the collection of eggs and juveniles remains the major threat to this species (2). Further threats are posed from continued habitat destruction killing by local people and from competition with the spectacle caiman (<i>Caiman crocodilus</i>) which is found in the same area (2).,Orinoco crocodiles are one of the most highly endangered of all <strong>crocodilians</strong> due to the small size and highly fragmented nature of their population (2). International trade in this species is banned under Appendix I of the Convention of International Trade in Endangered Species (CTIES) (3) and it is protected throughout much of its range (4). These protection measures however are largely ineffective and unforced and illegal poaching remains the principal threat to this species (2). In Colombia very little is known about the current status of the species and this remains a high priority for any conservation action plan (4). In Venezuela a reintroduction/ restocking plan has been developed and captive breeding is carried out at a number of sites (4).  Effective monitoring of released crocodiles is required and protection measures need to be properly enforced in order to help this species recover from such crippling over-exploitation in the past (4). ,hunting;pet; ,captive breeding;protected; ,2,2
Pelias orlovi; Vipera kaznakovi,Vipera orlovi,Orlov's viper (Vipera orlovi),Animalia,Chordata,Reptilia,Squamata,Viperidae,Vipera (1),Adult length: 50+ cm (2),With a population estimated to comprise less than 250 mature individuals fragmented into poorly connected sub-populations Orlov's viper is dangerously close to becoming extinct in the wild. Like many other reptile species around the world the principal threat to its survival is the uncontrolled collection of wild specimens for the pet trade (1). The poaching of rare species is alarmingly widespread in the mountains of the Caucasus with the illegal wildlife trade being one of the main conservation concerns in the region (10).,Owing to its precarious status in the wild Orlov's viper is in dire need of a raft of immediate conservation measures. The main priorities include the establishment of reserves where this Critically Endangered snake will be protected from poaching; the development of conservation legislation particularly concerning the regulation of trade; the implementation of education programmes for local people; and further research into the species' natural history distribution and population dynamics (1). ,poaching;pet; ,protected; ,2,1

Painted terrapins are massively exploited for their eggs which are sold for human consumption in many parts of Asia (5). Terrapin eggs are worth five times as much as chicken eggs and this species is particularly vulnerable to over-exploitation due to its low egg productivity (2). Habitat destruction is another major source of species decline; sand mining beach protection and beachfront development all disrupt the breeding habits of the terrapins (2).,International trade in painted terrapins is banned by its listing on Appendix I of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) (1) and protective legislation is also in place in most of Peninsular Malaysia (2). Egg harvesting may only be carried out by licensed collectors who then sell 70 percent of their haul to the Malaysian Fisheries Department to be incubated thus ensuring the sustainable management of this species (2). Prices offered by the Fisheries Department are however not competitive with those obtained on the black market and in the majority of cases only a very small percentage of turtle eggs are recovered (2). The enforcement of these schemes is a priority for future conservation action plans along with the protection of areas where significant populations are known to exist. A decline in the demand for terrapin eggs is the key to saving this species from extinction but would require a cultural change amongst local communities. , ,cites; ,0,1

It is thought that introduced grasses suppress the regeneration of the palila\xe2\x80\x99s main food source the mamane as well as increasing the risk of fire. The spread of feral pigs is also expected to suppress mamane regeneration (2).,The recent removal of sheep and goats from Mauna Kea\xe2\x80\x99s slopes has allowed some mamane regeneration but re-colonisation of suitable habitat is proving more difficult than expected (2). The palila will return to its home range following human intervention (7) as was found when several pairs were <strong>translocated</strong> in 1993 (2). A larger <strong>translocation</strong> was attempted in 2002 to test whether a more natural social environment and a larger pool of potential mates might encourage the <strong>translocated</strong> birds to remain in their new area.

Local people use the timber from <em>Ravenea musicalis</em> to fashion small canoe-like boats known as 'pirogues' (5). The area near where <em>Ravenea musicalis</em> occurs has been earmarked for large-scale titanium oxide mining; if mining goes ahead the impact on the ecology of all surrounding areas could be very severe and could affect the survival of this species (4).,Should this unique species be tragically lost from the wild there are hopes that it will persist in cultivation; <em>Ravenea musicalis</em> seeds have been collected and distributed to botanic gardens in Madagascar and around the world (4). However <em>Ravenea musicalis</em> has proved to be very difficult to maintain in cultivation (3). , , ,0,0
Rodrigues bottle palm; spindle palm,Hyophorbe verschaffeltii,Palmiste marron (Hyophorbe verschaffeltii),Plantae,Tracheophyta,Liliopsida,Arecales,Palmae,Hyophorbe (1),Height: up to 12 m (2)Trunk height: 6 - 9 m (2)Trunk diameter: 25 - 45 cm (2),Although widely cultivated as an ornamental palm (1) (5) (7) the palmiste marron is the second rarest palm on Rodrigues with fewer than 60 individuals left in the wild and little if any natural regeneration occurring on the island (1) (7) (8). The main threats to the species are overgrazing by cows sheep and goats as well as invasion by non-native plants high levels of seed predation by rats and severe fragmentation of the population (1) (7) (8). With such a tiny population events such as cyclones can also have catastrophic effects on this palm (8). Although the palmiste marron is being increasingly cultivated on Rodrigues to be planted as part of a habitat restoration project there is a threat of <strong>hybridisation</strong> with <em>Hyophorbe lagenicaulis</em> which has been introduced from Round Island (1) (7) (8).,Conservation measures recommended for the palmiste marron and other <strong>endemic</strong> palms of the Mascarene Islands include fencing and weeding of areas of native forest to protect the remaining wild palms as well as propagating species and re-introducing them into the wild and undertaking further biological research (7) (8). It will also be important to involve local communities with education programmes incentives from tourism and palm plantations and stricter laws for cutting down palms (7). The palmiste marron needs to be protected from <strong>hybridisation</strong> with closely-related palm species and legislation is needed to ban the introduction of non-native palms to Rodrigues. Palms that have already been introduced will also need to be removed although this has proved difficult to date because most are being grown in private gardens (7). Without a long-term conservation programme this unique and Critically Endangered palm is in great danger of becoming extinct in the wild (8). ,fragmentation; ,protected; ,1,1

The popularity of turtle meat once considered a luxury increased dramatically in the 1990s due in part to growing economies across Asia. This market has decimated native populations which are unable to sustain the demand and coupled with habitat loss has pushed many species to the brink of extinction (6).,In recognition of the precarious state of the population of Pan's box turtle the World Conservation Union (IUCN) classifies this species as Critically Endangered (1). International trade is restricted by the listing of this turtle of Appendix II of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) (2) but further research is desperately needed before more effective conservation measures can be put into place. ,loss; ,cites; ,1,1

Brazilian monkey puzzle tree; Candelabra tree,Araucaria angustifolia,Parana pine (Araucaria angustifolia),Plantae,Tracheophyta,Coniferopsida,Coniferales,Araucariaceae,Araucaria (1),Araucaria (1),Having suffered from intensive unsustainable logging throughout the 20th<sup>\xa0 </sup>century today the Parana pine exists only in relic populations (1). As an important commercial species the high quality wood of the Parana pine was exploited for the timber trade and its highly nutritious fruits were sold for human consumption (1) (4). However the Parana pine now occupies a patchy distribution across a limited range and consequently is one of Brazil\xe2\x80\x99s rarest trees (5). Amongst the remaining population there is a significant lack of fruiting trees which has severely limited the species\xe2\x80\x99 reproductive ability (4) (5). This has been further compounded by the annual exploitation of 3400 tons of its fruits and seeds. Attempts have been made to reintroduce the species into parts of its historical range but this has been prevented by the spread of competitive <em>Pinus</em> and <em>Eucalyptus</em> species and agricultural encroachment (1). \xa0\xa0\xa0,The survival of the Parana pine is now dependant upon the implementation of major conservation measures. The Brazilian government introduced a ban on the sale of this species in 2001 preventing further logging and several protected areas have been created with the objective of protecting remaining populations including the Campos do Jordao State Park the Irati National Park and the Cacador National Park (1) (2). Plans have also been developed to maintain the species\xe2\x80\x99 genetic diversity and the number of fruiting trees through seed collection improved forestry management practices and the development of locally coordinated agro-forestry schemes (4) (5).\xa0 ,pet; ,protected; ,1,1

These threats currently come in the form of ever-increasing tourist pressure the construction of roads and the use of all-terrrain vehicles (1) (3).  The collection of specimens may also be contributing to the decline in lizard numbers which has been observed over the last three decades.  In addition it is thought that the Pe\xc3\xb1a de Francia rock lizard may be very sensitive to any changes to the climate in its habitat and thus could be affected in the future by global climate change (1) (3).,The entire range of the Pe\xc3\xb1a de Francia rock lizard lies within the \xe2\x80\x98Parque Natural de las Batuecas y Sierra de Francia\xe2\x80\x99 a protected natural area (3) but this clearly does not protect it from all threats such as increasing tourism and thus a specific management plan for the recovery of this species is required (1).

Suitable forest habitat is diminishing as a result of land clearance for agriculture and livestock timber harvesting for charcoal and construction and small-scale mining for gemstones (4) and even within a so-called protected area where this species occurs an annual deforestation rate of 1.2 percent has been recorded (6). Whilst taboos against hunting once existed in many parts of Madagascar the increase in immigrants without belief in such taboos has led to a worrying growth in hunting (2). Such threats have already reduced this species\xe2\x80\x99 population to perilously low levels - in 2003-2004 it was estimated there were only 915 individuals remaining \xe2\x80\x93 and continue to push Perrier\xe2\x80\x99s sifaka towards extinction (6). Such a small population is at great risk of problems arising from loss of <strong>genetic variation</strong> making the long term viability of this species highly questionable (2) (6).,Analamerana Special Reserve harbours the majority of the Perrier\xe2\x80\x99s sifaka population (1) although rather than offering the protection this rare species requires forest within the reserve is still being gradually destroyed (1) (6) and this species clearly requires further protection if it is going to survive. Since 2005 a group of interested parties led by the Monaco-based non-governmental organisation Act for Nature and the Groupe d\xe2\x80\x99Etude et de Recherche sur les Primates de Madagascar have been conducting a conservation and research programme for Perrier\xe2\x80\x99s sifaka. The programme\xe2\x80\x99s goals are to secure this species\xe2\x80\x99 future in at least one major area currently without any degree of protection and to gain further scientific knowledge on this species that will help inform future conservation measures (7). The area between Analamerana Special Reserve and Ankarana Special Reserve is one area where forest protection has been strongly recommended (4). ,loss;hunting; , ,2,0

red-vented cockatoo,Cacatua haematuropygia,Philippine cockatoo (Cacatua haematuropygia),Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Psittaciformes,Psittacidae,Cacatua (1),300 g (2),Once widespread and fairly common the Philippine cockatoo has recently undergone a dramatic decline and is now one of the most threatened birds of the Philippines (7).  A combination of trapping for the <strong>aviculture</strong> trade and widespread deforestation has pushed the Philippine cockatoo towards the edge of extinction and it is now absent from 98 percent of its former range (2) (7).  A 1994 study showed this bird to be present on just eight of the Philippine islands (6).  Its remote forest habitat and agile flight are no deterrents for trappers who know the exact location of many of its nest holes and roosting sites and frequently raid them (7) (8).  In addition the Philippine cockatoo is persecuted for the damage it inflicts on crops (6) and an outbreak of Psittacine beak and feather disease may also be impacting the population (7).,The critically endangered Philippine cockatoo is listed on Appendix I of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) meaning that trade in this species is only permitted in exceptional circumstances (3) and it is also occurs in a number of protected areas (6).  In addition the Philippine Cockatoo Conservation Program implemented in 1998 is carrying out a number of measures to ensure the cockatoo\xe2\x80\x99s survival.  This includes researching the cockatoo\xe2\x80\x99s behaviour breeding habits and potentially threatening diseases; encouraging poachers and hunters to end their unsustainable activities and become wardens island rangers and guides instead; and a captive breeding program that serves as a safe-guard against this species\xe2\x80\x99 extinction (8).  With such valuable efforts taking place hopefully the current perilous situation will soon improve for the handsome Philippine cockatoo. ,disease; ,cites;captive breeding;protected; ,1,3
Animalia,Crocodylus mindorensis,Philippine crocodile (Crocodylus mindorensis),Animalia,Chordata,Reptilia,Crocodylia,Crocodylidae,Crocodylus (1),Male length: up to 3 m (2),The massive population decline of the Philippine crocodile was originally caused by excessive over-exploitation for commercial use (2). Today habitat destruction is the most pressing threat to species survival with rainforests being cleared throughout the region to make way for rice fields in an effort to cope with the human population explosion (2). Locals in this area are also in contact with the infamous esturine or 'saltwater' crocodile (<i>Crocodylus porosus</i>) which is one of the largest reptiles in the world and has a reputation as a man-eater. This factor undoubtedly contributes to local intolerance of any crocodile species even the small Philippine crocodile which is often killed when encountered (5). The very word for 'crocodile' in the Filipino language is a vile insult (7).,Next to the Chinese alligator (<i>Alligator sinensis</i>) the Philippine crocodile is considered to be the most endangered crocodilian in the world. Some authorities believe there may be less than 100 individuals left in the wild (3) although some wild habitat still remains. Urgent research is needed to assess the current status in order to implement an effective management strategy for this remaining wild population (3). This species is protected from international trade by its listing on Appendix I of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) but there is only one officially protected area within the Philippines and this is poorly enforced (3). At present captive breeding takes place in a small programme run by the Silliman University and at the government-run Crocodile Farming Institute which breeds crocodiles for commercial and conservation reasons (3). Sadly there is currently little political will or local tolerance to save this ancient reptile in the wild and for the short term at least captive breeding programmes may be the key to the at least nominal survival of this crocodile (3). , ,cites;captive breeding;protected; ,0,3
great Philippine eagle; monkey-eating eagle,Pithecophaga jefferyi,Philippine eagle (Pithecophaga jefferyi),Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Falconiformes,Accipitridae,Pithecophaga (1),6.5 kg (2),Although probably never abundant the population of the Philippine eagle has undergone a precipitous decline primarily as the result of habitat destruction (5). Vast tracts of tropical forests in the Philippines have been cleared for commercial development and for shifting cultivation (5). Mining activities and hunting pose further threats to the survival of this majestic bird and the accumulation of pesticides may be responsible for a reduction in reproductive rate (5).,The Philippine eagle is protected by law in the Philippines and occurs in a number of protected areas (5); international trade and movement of this species is also restricted and controlled by CITES (the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species) (1) (3). The Philippine Eagle Conservation Programme (2) is working on educational campaigns protecting and monitoring nests and a conservation breeding scheme (7); so far two captive-bred chicks have been produced with the aim of reintroducing them to the wild (6). In addition chicks and eggs have been taken from areas of habitat at risk in order to establish a viable captive population from which individuals can be reintroduced to the wild (2). Despite these efforts however should habitat loss and subsequent human settlement continue at the current rate it seems doubtful that this majestic species will ever recover. ,hunting; ,cites;protected; ,1,2

Such rarity has gained the Philippine pond turtle somewhat of a legendary reputation one that makes any further discovered individuals highly vulnerable to the pet trade where they would be a highly desired and valuable object (1).,Further research into the Philippine pond turtle is clearly needed (4) as more information would allow appropriate conservation actions to be implemented before time runs out for this mysterious reptile. ,pet; , ,1,0

The remaining forest is patchy and continues to be destroyed as exotic plantations are planted around and right up to the edges of the indigenous forest the harvesting of which is greatly disruptive to the forest (1). Timber plantations are also associated with a high level of invasion by alien plants. The construction of a national road through Ngele Forest has fragmented habitat and potentially populations of the pink velvet worm.,Although a permit is required to collect any animals from the province and some degree of habitat protection has been given by the State access to the area where this species occurs remains relatively uncontrolled (1). Future conservation measures advocated include a publicity campaign to raise awareness of the species and further research on population numbers range and biology of the species (1). Fortunately five specimens are currently thriving in captivity in Hamburg providing the opportunity to study their life cycle reproduction and feeding behaviour (6). Although this captive population safeguards the survival of the species for the time being more needs to be done to protect the pink velvet worm\xe2\x80\x99s diminishing restricted habitat if this ancient unusual and elusive species has any chance of surviving in the wild. , , ,0,0

Species that have a highly restricted range are particularly susceptible to extinction if habitats are disturbed or from catastrophic environmental events such as drought and fire.  In addition highland plants such as <i>Nepenthes aristolochoides</i>take longer to recover than lowland plants as growth is slower (2).,<i>Nepenthes aristolochiodes</i> is found within Kerinci-seblat National Park but over-collection and habitat loss remains a problem (2).  Although listed under Appendix II on the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) which limits the international export of this species (3) trade is very difficult to regulate.  There is no requirement for internationally traded <i>Nepenthes</i> to be identified down to species level and plants simply labelled as <i>Nepenthes </i>accounted for 94 percent of all exported <i>Nepenthes </i>plants between 1988 and 1993.

This species is prized by collectors and virtually all accessible plants have been removed.  In 1995 only 15 known plants remained.  It has an extremely restricted distribution making it vulnerable to habitat loss and degradation and catastrophic events such as drought and fire.  Recently much of the vegetation on Mount Kelam was burned damaging the habitat and further reducingthe ability of <i>Nepenthes clipeata</i> to recover from over collection (2).,<i>Nepenthes clipeata</i> does not grow in any protected area or national park.

In Indonesia habitat destruction is a major problem as a result of illegal and commercial logging and large agricultural projects such as rubber and oil palm plantations (7).  Sumatra has a very high rate of habitat loss with some areas losing up to 65 percent of their forest cover in the last 25 years (8).\xc2\xa0Only 33.8 percent of Sumatra remains covered by <strong>primary forest</strong> and only 1.3 percent of this is upper montane vegetation in which <i>Nepenthes lavicola </i>is found.  The highly localised distribution of <i>Nepenthes lavicola</i> makes it particularly susceptible to the impacts of habitat disturbance or catastrophic environmental events such as drought or fire.  In addition highland plants such as <i>Nepenthes lavicola</i> take longer than lowland plants to recover from any disturbance as growth is slower (2).,<i>Nepenthes lavicola </i>is listed on Appendix II of the Convention of International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) which limits international trade in this species.  However this is very difficult to regulate.  Trade in <i>Nepenthes</i> species does not need to be identified down to species level and plants simply labelled as <i>Nepenthes </i>accounted for 94 percent of exported plants between 1988 and 1993.  This needs to be remedied and urgent attention is required to close other trade loopholes. Presently over-collection does not seem to pose an extensive threat for <i>Nepenthes lavicola</i> and artificial cultivation reduces this threat further (2).

Like other tortoises and turtles this species has a slow growth rate and low breeding potential. In addition it takes individuals a long time to reach sexual maturity. All of these factors reduce the capacity of populations to recover from human-induced effects on the population (5) (7).,A recovery programme was established for this species in 1986 by the Jersey Wildlife Preservation Trust in collaboration with the Malagasy Department of Waters and Forests.  A captive-breeding facility was established in Madagascar and within eight years over 100 young ploughshare tortoises had been bred. A study into the habitat of the species and interactions with humans was also established and a grassroots-level environmental education programme was set up (10). Experimental reintroductions of captive-bred tortoises have been successful to date and large-scale release to re-establish extirpated populations are being planned (5). Although international trade in the ploughshare tortoise is illegal due to its listing under Appendix I of the Convention of International trade in Endangered Species (CITES) poor enforcement of the exotic pet trade is causing great problems. In 1996 73 individuals were stolen from the captive breeding programme in Madagascar and as recently as 2003 reptile collectors have been arrested with wild ploughshare tortoises in their possession destined for the international exotic pet market (5). When a species is this rare outrageous crimes such as these have serious implications for the already precarious state of the species (11).  These incidents have highlighted weaknesses in wildlife law which must be urgently addressed (11). ,loss; ,cites;captive breeding; ,1,2

Cyclones storms and habitat loss are also likely to have had a significant impact with the largest atolls with the richest vegetation having been cleared for coconut plantations (2) (4).,Several surveys have been conducted on islands in the Tuamotu Archipelago (2) including an expedition by MANU (BirdLife in French Polynesia) sponsered by the BP Conservation Programme (5). A follow-up expedition by the BP Conservation Programme was planned for 2000 to 2001 to initiate protection measures and management plans to conserve the Polynesian ground-dove (2) (5). These plans included conducting important research into the ecology of the bird protecting its habitat from human disturbance raising local awareness of the species and initiating a captive breeding programme on Tahiti to safeguard the species from extinction. Introduced predators would also be eradicated from a suitable nearby island with the aim of translocating ground-doves there (5). ,loss; ,captive breeding; ,1,1

Hot ash gases and rocks destroyed trees blocked rivers and caused flash floods destroying much vegetation (4) (5). Prior to this event the pribby was known only from herbarium specimens collected in 1979. However surveys on Montserrat in 2006 rediscovered the pribby but found it to be rare with a total distribution of just 17 square kilometres. Furthermore most of its populations were found to be situated outside of the island\xe2\x80\x99s one protected forest area (2) (3).\xa0,With over 800 native plant species Montserrat is one of the richest of all the UK Overseas Territories in terms of its plant diversity. The UK Overseas Territories team at the Royal Botanic Gardens Kew has been involved in conservation projects in Montserrat since 1998. Once such project entitled 'Enabling the people of Montserrat to conserve the Centre Hills' collected specimens and habitat information and assessed the plant diversity of an area relatively undamaged by volcanic eruptions. An additional project focused more closely on the islands two <strong>endemic</strong> species; the pribby and the Montserrat orchid (<em>Epidendrum montserratense</em>) (4) (5). After this survey rediscovered several populations of the pribby the Botanic Garden in Montserrat planted a demonstration hedge of this species to assess its potential as a native hedging plant for use instead of introduced species. In addition it has recently flowered in Kew's nursery glasshouses which is the first time its flowers have been seen outside Montserrat (2). ,loss;invasive; , ,2,0

Many of these threats interlink making the problems harder to resolve.\xa0,The puaiohi is protected by federal and state law and its range is part of a reserve the Alaka`I Wilderness Preserve established in 1964 (3) (7). A successful captive breeding programme is in place for the species and numerous captive-bred individuals have been released back into the wild (2). As a consequence the breeding population numbers are rising so the species may be moved from Critically Endangered to the less threatened status of Endangered in the future (2). ,invasive;disease;pet; ,captive breeding;protected; ,3,2

Low reproductive rates which exacerbate the problem by making recovery slow could be due to low pollen production low establishment of seedlings and the decline of natural pollinators (5). An additional fear is low genetic variability as a result of inbreeding between the few remaining plants will mean failure to produce healthy seedlings able of responding to environmental change (4).,The Conservation Department of the National Tropical Botanical Garden (NTBG) in Hawaii has taken a lead in the conservation of this rare and unusual species by conducting manual pollination and seed collection. As a result cultivated conservation collections have been established which will ensure against total extinction. Recovery plans are being created that will investigate possible alternative pollinators and create guidelines for the reintroduction of the pua\xe2\x80\x99ala (4). It has been suggested that a successful recovery plan needs to examine the whole of the reproductive strategy and also map the genetic diversity in the surviving populations. Research into possible pests and diseases and testing the influence of weeding and fencing has also been advocated (5). ,environmental;environment;pet; , ,3,0

Puerto Rican parrot; red-fronted Amazon,Amazona vittata,Puerto Rican Amazon (Amazona vittata),Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Psittaciformes,Psittacidae,Amazona (1),250 â 300 g (2),So far the Puerto Rican Amazon has only narrowly escaped extinction reaching an all-time low of just 13 birds in 1975 (7). The initial and primary cause of decline was the widespread forest clearance that accompanied European settlement during the 18th and 19th Centuries (2). The bird has also suffered badly from persecution as a crop pest and hunting for food and the pet trade so that by the 1930s this previously abundant species had dramatically reduced to around 2000 individuals confined to a small range in the Luquillo Mountains (3) (6). The species then endured an ongoing decline until 1975 after which intensive conservation efforts helped it to gradually recover although efforts were hindered by the impact of Hurricane Hugo in September 1989 which reduced the population of 47 birds to 22 (2) (3). Despite recent population increases the parrot is considered Critically Endangered because its numbers still remain dangerously small (7). Currently the principle threats are competition for nest-sites loss of young to parasitic botflies (<i>Philornis pici</i>) predation by the pearly-eyed thrasher (<i>Margarops</i> <i>fuscatus</i>) and the red-tailed hawk (<i>Buteo</i> <i>jamaicensis</i>) and natural disasters such as hurricanes (7) (8). The extremely small size of the remaining population deems all threats incredibly serious (8).,In 1968 concentrated conservation efforts were begun to try to mitigate all these threats involving experiments with artificial nest-sites control of nest predators and competitors and captive breeding and <strong>re-introduction</strong> (7). The Puerto Rican Parrot Recovery\xc2\xa0Programme was begun\xc2\xa0between the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) the U.S.D.A. Forest Service and the Puerto Rico Department of Natural and Environmental Resources (DNER) (9). Captive breeding was initiated in 1973 with the creation of the Luquillo Aviary within the Caribbean National Forest (4). In 1993 this captive flock was split and a portion moved to a second aviary in Rio Abajo at the opposite end of the island in order to prevent the potential catastrophic loss of the entire captive flock due to hurricanes or disease (4) (5) (8). The captive breeding programme has experienced great success with 190 birds now living in the two breeding aviaries (4). Since May 2000 captive reared parrots have been being released into the wild to bolster the wild population with over 40 birds released to date (4). All remaining habitat is protected in the Caribbean National Forest (7) but it is nevertheless possible that a single powerful hurricane could destroy the entire wild population in their restricted range of a single mountainous valley (4). Thus exciting plans have been made by Dr. White for a huge release in 2006 into a second more protected Karst region on the opposite end of the island (4). Should this introduction be successful this rare parrot will be given an infinitely greater chance of survival and although still critically low the species\xe2\x80\x99 steadily increasing numbers provide a glimpse of hope for the future. ,loss;hunting;pet; ,captive breeding;protected; ,3,2
black sage; cliff manjack,Cordia rupicola,Puerto Rico manjack (Cordia rupicola),Plantae,Tracheophyta,Magnoliopsida,Lamiales,Boraginaceae,Cordia (1),Height: up to 5 m (2) (3),The main threat to the Puerto Rico manjack is habitat loss and fragmentation due to residential and tourist developments on Anegada (1) (3) (9). This habitat loss is only likely to accelerate over the next few years and is compounded by other threats from road construction invasive plant species fire and trampling and grazing by introduced cattle goats and donkeys (1) (3) (9). As its highest point is no more than eight metres above sea level Anegada is also highly vulnerable to the effects of climate change and associated sea level rise (1) (6) (8).,Part of the Puerto Rico manjack\xe2\x80\x99s preferred limestone habitat on Anegada occurs within a designated Ramsar site (1) (10) and legislation is being prepared to declare this a protected area (1). Protected Wildlife legislation for Anegada is also being revised (1) and an action plan has been produced for the island\xe2\x80\x99s coastal biodiversity as part of a Darwin Initiative Project (9). ,loss;fragmentation;invasive; ,protected; ,3,1
purple-barred ground-dove; purple-winged ground dove,Claravis geoffroyi,Purple-winged ground-dove (Claravis geoffroyi),Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Columbiformes,Columbidae,Claravis (1),Length: 19-23 cm (2),With a population estimated at just 50 to 249 mature individuals in 2003 the situation for this species is critical (2). The most significant threat to the purple-winged ground-dove is habitat loss (2) (3). Its range falls within the most important agricultural land in Brazil (3) and its habitat has therefore been subject to large-scale clearance for agricultural plantations leaving the remainder highly fragmented (2). This has led to concern that the increased distances between local bamboo flowering events and the likelihood of long periods without bamboo seed production anywhere within its range will rapidly drive the purple-winged ground-dove to extinction (2).,Although the purple-winged ground-dove has been recorded in several protected areas in Brazil and in Iguaz\xc3\xba National Park in Argentina only small numbers have been observed and the enforcement of habitat protection in these areas is often inadequate. The current priority for this species is therefore to conduct surveys to locate additional populations and to learn more about its biology so that effective conservation strategies can be employed (2). ,loss; ,captive breeding;protected; ,1,2

A number of conservation strategies have since been put in place which should hopefully help protect this species from the threats it faces. This includes fencing plants to protect them from cattle such as on the Navy\xe2\x80\x99s Lualualei Naval Reservation where a program of alien plant removal is also ongoing (2) and the development of fire protection plans such as in Kanepuu Preserve on Lanai Island (2) which should reduce the threat pu\xe2\x80\x99u wa\xe2\x80\x99awa\xe2\x80\x99a faces from fire. ,pet; , ,1,0

The only viable population of pygmy hogs is today restricted to Manas National Park and it is thought that possibly as few as 100 to 150 pygmy hogs remain (4). Even within the park boundaries there are threats from livestock grazing poaching and fire; whilst continued political unrest in the area severely hampers effective conservation efforts (2).,The pygmy hog is protected under Schedule I of the Wildlife (Protection) Act 1972 in India and international trade is banned by its listing on Appendix I of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) (2). Manas National Park was declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1986 (2). The Pygmy Hog Conservation Programme (PHCP) was established in 1995 under the aegis of a formal 'International Conservation Management and Reseach Agreement (ICMRA)' between the Pigs Peccaries and Hippo Specialist Group (8) of the IUCN the Durrell Wildlife Conservation Trust (9) and relevant local and national governmental authorities (2). The PHCP has carried out a multi-faceted strategy including field status surveys behavioural studies captive breeding personnel training and local community awareness and assistance programmes (2). The Pygmy Hog Research and Breeding Centre near Guwahati in Assam was established in 1996 and by the year 2000 the only captive population of this species had grown from the original six individuals to a total of 77 (2). In 2008 16 of these pygmy hogs were released into the Sonai Rupai Wildlife Reserve where they will be carefully monitored (10). The captive population is a potentially crucial insurance for keeping this small pig from extinction (2). ,poaching; ,cites;captive breeding;protected; ,1,3

Although droughts and population fluctuations have been a natural occurrence throughout Raso Island\xe2\x80\x99s recorded history there is concern that the effects of climate change may lead to more extreme periods of drought leading to this species\xe2\x80\x99 extinction (2) (3).,Not only is the Raso lark a protected species under Cape Verde law but Raso Island is classified as a National Park and requires official authorisation to visit (2) (3).

Animalia,Canis rufus,Red wolf (Canis rufus),Animalia,Chordata,Mammalia,Carnivora,Canidae,Canis (1),20 - 35 kg (4),The population of red wolves suffered as a result of persecution and habitat loss as mature woodlands were cleared to make way for agriculture (9). Red wolves were extensively trapped and shot as they were believed to pose a direct threat to livestock and game (5). <strong>Hybridisation</strong> posed a further threat to the survival of the species as the population became increasingly fragmented; isolated individuals would crossbreed with the closely related coyote (<i>Canis latrans</i>) (10). The taxonomic status of the red wolf has been widely debated. Recent genetic and morphological research suggests that the red wolf is a unique species rather than the hybrid offspring from gray wolf (<i>Canis lupus</i>) and coyote (<i>Canis latrans</i>) <strong>interbreeding</strong> (5) (11).,Despite the ongoing debate as to the species status of the red wolf the recovery programme initiated by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service is one of the most successful large mammal conservation efforts (9). Steps to save this much-maligned species began in 1967 and culminated in the <strong>re-introduction</strong> of captive-bred individuals into the wild. Four pairs of red wolves were released in North Carolina starting in 1987 (10). A second attempt in the Great Smoky Mountains National Park in Tennessee was conducted between 1992 and 1998 but was cancelled due to the inability of wolves to establish home ranges within the park and extremely low pup survival caused by diseases from domestic dogs (4). The North Carolina population is currently doing well an amazing feat considering the species was at one time extinct in the wild. The species is fully protected within the current range (12) but educational programmes around the release areas are essential in ensuring public support and success of the <strong>re-introduction</strong>.

These reductions were believed to be due to various factors including the fall in populations of large <strong>ungulates</strong> as a result of uncontrolled hunting disease direct persecution of the birds and developments in waste disposal meaning that carcasses were more likely to be quickly disposed of in areas of human habitation (4) (6).,Although the red-headed vulture occurs in various protected areas throughout its range these are unable protect it from diclofenac treated livestock. Fortunately the manufacture of diclofenac has now been banned in India Nepal and Pakistan and its use is being phased out and replaced with a similar drug that is not toxic to vultures. However it may be some years before the use of diclofenac completely comes to an end in these countries. It is therefore urgent that captive-breeding programs similar to those being employed for <i>Gyps </i>species be developed in order to safeguard this species from total extinction (4). ,loss;hunting;disease;pet; ,protected; ,4,1

The aquarium fish trade may be one of the reasons for its decline in the wild although there is not yet any evidence to support this theory. A more likely reason for the redtailed black shark\xe2\x80\x99s demise is habitat alteration; during the 1970s numerous dams were constructed in Thailand which probably had severe impacts on the rivers in the region. Large areas of swamps in Thailand have also been drained destroying potential habitat for the redtailed black shark (1).,Due to its popularity in the aquarium trade (tens of thousands of captive bred individuals are exported annually from Thailand) (1) the redtailed black shark\xe2\x80\x99s survival is probably not currently at risk. ,pollution; ,captive breeding; ,1,1

Around 75 percent of the regent honeyeater\xe2\x80\x99s habitat is thought to have been cleared for agricultural or residential purposes including substantial areas of yellow box (<em>E. melliodora</em>) and white box woodlands which are particularly important to the regent honeyeater (6). The natural regeneration of these woodlands is also limited through livestock overgrazing the removal of mature seed dispersing trees and unnatural fire regimes (3). Many remnant woodlands are now heavily degraded and highly fragmented limiting the regent honeyeater\xe2\x80\x99s ability to move across the landscape. Woodland fragmentation also allows populations of more aggressive honeyeaters such as the noisy miner (<em>Manorina melanocephela</em>) to expand which often out-compete the regent honeyeater for foraging and nesting opportunities (6). In the face of such severe pressure the regent honeyeater population is declining and is now estimated at an alarmingly low 1500 mature individuals (4).,The regent honeyeater is described as a flagship species for the conservation of Australia\xe2\x80\x99s native woodlands as efforts to save this species should help conserve many other threatened species found within its habitat. As a result the regent honeyeater has received a large degree of interest and conservation objectives are outlined in a detailed recovery plan (7). Consequently timber extraction grazing and mining have all been prohibited or minimised in a number of sites that are regularly used by the species while guidelines have also been employed to ensure proper land and forestry management and to protect suitable breeding and foraging sites (6).\xa0\xa0\xa0 ,loss;fragmentation;pet; ,protected; ,3,1

The majority of the land in the Karoo Desert is very unfertile but the riverine rabbit occupies the flood plains of the seasonal Karoo rivers and its tributaries which are fertile and have therefore been ploughed extensively in some areas. Removal of the natural vegetation along the rivers and streams prevents the rabbit from constructing stable breeding burrows due to the loss of the soft <strong>alluvial</strong> top soils and from feeding and escaping predation (1). Overgrazing by domestic herbivores also poses a threat to the rabbits\xe2\x80\x99 habitat and results in habitat degradation and fragmentation (2). As rabbits and hares are adding to the menu of farm workers they are shot or trapped with gin traps (1).,The Endangered Wildlife Trust\xe2\x80\x99s Riverine Rabbit Working Group (EWT-RRWG) was established in August 2003 with the aim of establishing and conserving an ecosystem and socioeconomic conditions in the Karoo that can support a stable population of riverine rabbits. The EWT-RRWG achieves this through surveys research and monitoring environmental education and awareness habitat management and rehabilitation and conservation stewardship programmes. At present none of the riverine rabbit habitat is protected and the species only occurs on private Karoo farmland. Therefore the establishment of Riverine Rabbit Conservancies is an important aim for the EWT-RRWG. Conservancies are areas established by a voluntary agreement with private landowners who have riverine rabbits and potentially suitable habitat on their properties. So far three have been established in the Karoo. The conservation and management of riverine rabbit populations and their habitat is outlined in the conservancy constitution and landowners strictly control or prohibit any hunting with dogs and the use of gin traps (7). With the EWT-RRWG raising awareness of the riverine rabbit\xe2\x80\x99s threatened status and coordinating conservation efforts it is hoped that the risk of extinction to this rare species can be reduced. ,loss;fragmentation; ,protected; ,2,1

Rodrigues fruit bat,Pteropus rodricensis,Rodrigues flying fox (Pteropus rodricensis),Animalia,Chordata,Mammalia,Chiroptera,Pteropodidae,Pteropus (1),350 g (2),This species is in grave danger of extinction in the wild on Rodrigues Island as a result of habitat loss shooting and hunting for meat (5). These are believed to be the causes of its extinction in Mauritius where the species was once found in the wild. Now it is only observed there in captivity. These bats also face severe natural threats annually of tropical cyclones which blow animals out to sea where they die as well as destroy their habitats depriving them of food and shelter (4).,In 1976 the Rodrigues fruit bats were on the brink of extinction. This species\xe2\x80\x99 survival in the wild seemed unlikely prompting the Jersey Preservation Trust to collect 25 bats for a captive breeding project (5). This species is now part of an international Species Program (SSP) with 16 participating North American Institutes (5) and in 1992 was listed as \xe2\x80\x98Priority Grade 1\xe2\x80\x99 in the IUCN\xe2\x80\x99s <i>Action Plan for Old World Fruit Bats</i> putting it into the most urgent conservation category (8). ,loss;hunting; ,captive breeding; ,2,1

Animalia,Cinclodes aricomae,Royal cinclodes (Cinclodes aricomae),Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Furnariidae,Cinclodes (1),50 g (2),The royal cinclodes is under severe threat from the loss and degradation of <em>Polylepis</em> woodland which is now scarce and fragmented occupying only a fraction of its original cover. Heavy grazing and the uncontrolled use of fire have degraded understorey moss cover and prevented <em>Polylepis</em> regeneration whilst cutting of trees for timber firewood and charcoal production have further reduced available habitat (2) (3) (4) (6) (7) (9). As a result of this widespread habitat loss the royal cinclodes has been reduced to tiny subpopulations and may number fewer than 250 birds in total (2) (4) (7).,The royal cinclodes occurs in a number of protected areas including Madidi and Cotapata National Parks in Brazil (2) (4) and the Historic Sanctuary of Machu Picchu in Peru a World Heritage Site (10). A number of conservation programmes are also underway or have been proposed for the species including projects working with local communities to conserve <em>Polylepis</em> woodland; further research into the species\xe2\x80\x99 status ecology and distribution; environmental education and awareness campaigns; and efforts to improve land-use management (3) (4) (7). A project run by the American Bird Conservancy and the Asociaci\xc3\xb3n de Ecosistemas Andinos (ECOAN) is also aiming to restore <em>Polylepis</em> woodland and establish community protected areas covering this vulnerable habitat whilst also undertaking sustainable development projects that will benefit local people (9) (11). Despite its perilous situation these conservation efforts may go some way towards providing a brighter future for the royal cinclodes and recent records of this rare bird several hundred kilometres outside of its known range have given new hope that it may be more widespread than previously believed (4) (7) (8). ,loss; ,protected; ,1,1

Vast areas of <strong>spawning</strong> ground have been lost due to the damming and exploitation of river systems throughout its range and pollution in the Caspian and Black Sea basins is causing devastating hormonal imbalances and a greater number of <strong>hermaphroditic</strong> individuals (1) (8).,Although there is a restricted sturgeon fishing season and a license to fish is necessary in most of the countries within its range the Russian sturgeon remains largely un-protected in most of the areas in which it occurs. For example the absence of a strict monitoring system makes controlling fishing very difficult. Iran has banned private sturgeon fisheries but in general conservation measures are either absent weak or ignored (1). ,poaching;pollution; ,protected; ,2,1

Although it may be tolerant of small-scale farming it is found in much higher densities near streams away from farms and so the area of optimal habitat for the species may be small. In addition much of Sagalla Hill is now covered with eucalyptus plantations in which the dry compacted soil and lack of soil <strong>invertebrates</strong> presents an unsuitable habitat for caecilians\xa0(1)\xa0(2)\xa0(4). The species is also absent from remaining natural forest at higher elevations which may either be above its natural range or have otherwise unsuitable conditions\xa0(1)\xa0(4).,Very little is currently known about this recently discovered species\xa0(4) and it does not occur in any protected areas\xa0(1)\xa0(4). However a number of conservation initiatives are in place in the region including a study into amphibian diversity\xa0(4). This caecilian is seen locally as an indicator of rich fertile soil\xa0(2) and efforts have been underway to raise its profile amongst local communities including a competition to find a name for the species in the local dialect\xa0(4) (11). The Zoological Society of London\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cEDGE of Existence\xe2\x80\x9d campaign is also working to establish a caecilian preserve and to restore habitat for the species\xa0(2)\xa0(4). ,loss; ,protected; ,1,1

Hunting is banned throughout the saiga\xe2\x80\x99s range (9).

St. Croix ground lizard,Ameiva polops,Saint Croix ground lizard (Ameiva polops),Animalia,Chordata,Reptilia,Squamata,Teiidae,Ameiva (1),Length (excluding tail): 35 â 77 mm (2),The main reasons for the disappearance of the Saint Croix ground lizard on Saint Croix Island are habitat loss and the introduction of a mammalian predator the Indian mongoose (<i>Herpestes auropunctatus</i>) both of which continue to threaten the future of the species in its remaining range (2). There is evidence that the decline on Saint Croix Island correlates with the introduction of the Indian mongoose in 1884 (2). The accidental introduction of the mongoose onto Green Protestant or Ruth Cay could be catastrophic most likely resulting in the extinction of the species (4).,Green Cay was established as a National Wildlife Refuge in 1977 by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to protect the largest remaining population of the Saint Croix ground lizard. This refuge protects 14 out of the 18 acres of designated critical habitat on Green Cay which is closed to the public keeping human disturbance to a minimum (4). ,loss;disease; , ,2,0

On Santa Catalina Island \xe2\x80\x98pit fall\xe2\x80\x99 traps have been found and people have been seen collecting reptiles in bags.  In addition predation by feral cats and a decline in the Santa Catalina Island rattlesnake\xe2\x80\x99s main prey the deer mouse may pose a threat to this now Critically Endangered species (1).,There are currently no conservation plans in place for this highly threatened reptile.  Like many other snakes this species may receive less conservation attention than it deserves due to long-standing and fairly widespread negative attitudes towards snakes (4).  The implementation of a program to control the population of feral cats on the island has been suggested as a measure to help secure the survival of this rare and fascinating snake (1). , , ,0,0

In the 1800s the rate of deforestation accelerated dramatically first with the production of coffee and later with cocoa. At one stage in the early 20th century S\xc3\xa3o Tom\xc3\xa9 was the world\xe2\x80\x99s largest producer of cocoa with an estimated 42 percent of the island being devoted to its production. The crash in the price of cocoa and the island\xe2\x80\x99s conversion to independence in 1975 put a stop to forest clearance but not before almost all the island\xe2\x80\x99s lowland <strong>primary forest</strong> had been destroyed (5). The impact of this large scale loss of habitat for the S\xc3\xa3o Tom\xc3\xa9 fiscal is plain to see with its population estimated in 2000 to be less than 50 individuals (2). While much of the cultivated land has now reverted back to <strong>secondary forest</strong> the S\xc3\xa3o Tom\xc3\xa9 fiscal appears to be restricted to the tiny remaining areas of lowland <strong>primary forest</strong>. Fortunately because these areas are so remote they are not under immediate threat but with road development opening up more and more land on the island this could very easily change in the future. Furthermore there is high probability that introduced animals such as rats monkeys weasels and civets have had a negative impact on nesting birds including the S\xc3\xa3o Tom\xc3\xa9 fiscal (2) (5).,With patches of <strong>primary forest</strong> protected within Obo Natural Park on S\xc3\xa3o Tom\xc3\xa9 it is hoped that habitat suitable for the S\xc3\xa3o Tom\xc3\xa9 fiscal will be preserved for the future. However the benefit this species derives from this protected area is unclear as its specific ecological requirements are still so poorly understood (2) (7). It is therefore paramount that further research is carried out to develop a greater understanding of this species\xe2\x80\x99 ecology as well as its population size and dynamics. This information will be invaluable in determining which areas should be prioritised for protection. Unfortunately as with many developing countries human and financial resources for conservation are limited and consequently at this stage law enforcement is non-existent. Nonetheless proposals have been made to actively manage and protect these areas as well as to list the S\xc3\xa3o Tom\xc3\xa9 fiscal as a protected species under national law. This is something that will become more and more crucial as development begins to encroach on the remnant patches of <strong>primary forest</strong> favoured by the S\xc3\xa3o Tom\xc3\xa9 fiscal and many other <strong>endemic</strong> species (2). ,loss; ,protected; ,1,1

Naturally this had a devastating impact on much of the <strong>endemic</strong> wildlife including the S\xc3\xa3o Tom\xc3\xa9 grosbeak population (2) (3). Today the population is estimated at less than 50 individuals restricted to habitat under increasing pressure from land privatisation (2) (4). Furthermore road developments along the east and west coasts are increasing access to previously remote areas while introduced rats monkeys weasels and civets are all potential predators (2) (3).,Primary forest is protected as a Zona Ecologica and within Obo Natural Park but there is no law enforcement within these areas and owing to the lack of information on the S\xc3\xa3o Tom\xc3\xa9 grosbeak\xe2\x80\x99s ecological requirements it is not known how much it benefits from its occurrence within these areas. Fortunately this species mainly occurs in a relatively remote part of the island visited only by hunters who do not pose a threat to it. \xa0Recently the Associa\xc3\xa7\xc3\xa3o dos Bi\xc3\xb3logos Santomenses has been offering training course to the local community in order to raise awareness and involve people in the monitoring and conservation of S\xc3\xa3o Tom\xc3\xa9\xe2\x80\x99s <strong>endemic</strong> birds.

The species has a small range where it is increasingly threatened by habitat loss and especially hunting and snaring (1). Hunters intensively pursue animals valued in traditional East Asian \xe2\x80\x98medicine\xe2\x80\x99 and the local bushmeat trades and although the saola itself apparently has limited value and is not pursued aggressively it is killed incidentally in the pursuit of other species. In the past hunters have also tried to capture the saola because of the intense interest in this new and strange species (3). Sadly the more than a dozen saola known to have been captured and held in captivity were all poorly kept and with the exception of two that were quickly released into the wild all died within days or weeks or at most five months of their capture (2) (7). None are in captivity anywhere in the world today. As of November 2010 the most recent confirmed record of the species was an adult male captured by villagers in northern Laos in August 2010 and held by them for several days before it too died (9).\xa0,The saola is found in a number of protected areas in which conservation initiatives have been implemented. In Vietnam in the Vu Quang Nature Reserve where the saola was first discovered the Ministry of Forestry has cancelled its logging operations (8) and surveys and other conservation activities have also been conducted in the Pu Huong Nature Reserve in cooperation with Vietnam's Vinh University (7). Furthermore within the Pu Mat National Park many surveys on the distribution and ecology of the saola were carried out between 1998 and 2003 as part of the Social Forestry and Nature Conservation project (7). The Ministry of Forestry in Vietnam has also issued a ban on further capture trade or holding of this rare animal given its apparent inability to survive captivity (2).\xa0 ,loss;hunting; ,protected;wwf; ,2,2

Encouragingly the population on La Digue has recently shown a marked increase and may be more adaptable than was previously feared; <strong>territories</strong> have been found in woodland near to housing developments (2). ,disease; , ,1,0
Animalia,Coleura seychellensis,Seychelles sheath-tailed bat (Coleura seychellensis),Animalia,Chordata,Mammalia,Chiroptera,Emballonuridae,Coleura (1),Head-body length: 55 â 65 mm (2)Male weight: 10.2 g (2)Female weight: 11.1 g (2),The Seychelles sheath-tailed bat has been lost from the majority of islands where it was originally found. The precise cause of this dramatic decline is unclear; it has been speculated that introduction of the predatory barn owl (<i>Tyto alba</i>) and declines in insect availability resulting from use of pesticides may be involved (3). However the recent discovery of a second roost near marshes on Silhouette showed that the bats here feed on different insects than those eaten by roosts that forage in palm woodlands elsewhere (4). It has therefore been argued that this variability in the diet demonstrates that food is not a limiting factor for the species and the decline in the species may rather be attributable to habitat alteration caused by invasive plants obstructing roost entrances (4).,The Nature Protection Trust of the Seychelles has monitored the known population of Seychelles sheath-tailed bats since 1997 (5) (6). As with other bats the protection of roosts and foraging habitat are of great importance. Existing roosts must be preserved not only from human disturbance but also from introduced plant species that smother the cave entrances (4). To this end one roost site had the invasive Kudzu vine <i>Pueraria phaesolides</i> cut back from its entrance in 2001 and 2004 and ongoing management aims to completely remove the species from the area (4). It is hoped that removal of invasive creepers from existing and abandoned roost sites will help to increase the desperately low numbers of this critically endangered bat to more sustainable levels. ,invasive; , ,1,0

Due to its restricted range this species is particularly sensitive to human disturbance such as habitat destruction (2). In the early 1990s <strong>semi-deciduous</strong> forest between Paraiso and Nueva Delhi was cleared to allow small-holder farming of maize coffee and fruit. Estimating the extent of the resulting habitat loss and degradation has been problematic as the remaining forest provides cover for the growth of illegal drugs (2).,The short-crested coquette is listed on Appendix II of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) which serves to regulate the trade in this species (3)<warehouse:ref entitytype="ScientificReference"></warehouse:ref>. ,loss; ,cites;protected; ,1,2

Crocodile Du Siam,Crocodylus siamensis,Siamese crocodile (Crocodylus siamensis),Animalia,Chordata,Reptilia,Crocodylia,Crocodylidae,Crocodylus (1),Male length: 3 m (2),Siamese crocodiles are under threat from human disturbance and habitat occupation which is forcing remaining populations to the edges of their former range (5). The conversion of rainforest habitat to agricultural use along with aggressive hunting for crocodile skins have contributed to the decline of this species of crocodile (5). In Cambodia which is the species' last remaining stronghold incursion into pristine habitat is now occurring through aid development programs and the hunting of adult females for crocodile farm stock is reported to be widespread (2).,Until recently very little data existed on Siamese crocodile numbers and distribution a factor which led to the species being reported as virtually extinct in the wild in 1992 (5). Since then a large amount of research has been conducted and this has shown a slightly more encouraging picture although the status is still hard to judge. Siamese crocodiles appear to be mainly found in Cambodia where updated estimates suggest a population of no greater than 5000 individuals (2) though it may be considerably less (5). However the species is extensively maintained and bred in captivity in both Thailand and Cambodia where it is farmed for the commercial value of its skins (2). The species is considered relatively inoffensive to humans making restocking programmes a distinct possibility provided sufficient habitat is maintained and protected. Local people have been reported to protect crocodiles which they view to be sacred (2). Programs are already underway in Thailand (2) and although the future of the Siamese crocodile remains in the balance there is more optimism than a decade ago. ,hunting; ,protected; ,1,1

Siberian white crane; snow crane,Leucogeranus leucogeranus,Siberian crane (Leucogeranus leucogeranus),Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Gruiformes,Gruidae,Leucogeranus (1),4.9 - 8.6 kg (2),Main threats include habitat loss and degradation in the wintering grounds migratory stopover sites and breeding grounds. The construction of the Three Gorges Dam and the resulting hydrological changes to the lower Yangtze River is likely to have a major impact on the wintering population (6). Human pressures throughout the range are increasing and drainage agricultural development oil extraction and development are identified risks (7). Hunting in Pakistan and Afghanistan is a concern (6) and the recent war in Afghanistan is also thought to have affected migrating cranes (8). At present the populations are so small that they are vulnerable to chance events such as an outbreak of disease or extreme weather conditions genetic problems may arise as a result of increased <strong>inbreeding</strong> and the structure of the population in terms of sex-ratio and age may become skewed leading to further problems (7).,The Siberian crane is legally protected in all the countries in which it occurs and is protected from international trade by its listing on Appendix I of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) (6). Conservation of this species began in the 1970s and a number of protected areas have been established at key sites and migratory stopovers in Russia China Pakistan and India. Educational programmes have been carried out in India Pakistan and Afghanistan. Three captive-breeding facilities have been set up and a number of releases have been made (7) particularly to augment the central population (6). Research into the species is ongoing and current efforts are attempting to establish an International Siberian Crane Recovery Team and a Recovery Plan for the species (7). ,loss;hunting;disease; ,cites;protected; ,3,2

This species appears to be facing competition from the beech <i>Fagus sylvatica</i> which may be more adaptable to climatic changes. A reduction in deep soil following deforestation could also have played a part in the decline of the Sicilian fir (2). The small numbers of firs remaining are now at an inherent risk from any chance event and fire poses a particular danger.,The Sicilian fir has been the subject of a concerted conservation programme to protect this rare and unique local species. The remaining wild trees occur within a Regional Park; grazing and visitor numbers in the valley are carefully controlled and the trees are monitored and fenced off (3). In addition an <glos><i>ex-situ</i></glos> conservation programme has been established and has produced around 110000 trees that are available for replanting. To date replanting efforts have met with little success but scientists at the University of Palermo are investigating this species\xe2\x80\x99 optimum ecological conditions in an effort to rectify this (3).

Habitat destruction and hunting are the primary threats that have brought the silky sifaka to this perilous position and continue to threaten the future survival of this species. Habitat destruction such as <strong>slash-and-burn</strong> agriculture logging and mining takes place even within so-called protected areas and (7) unfortunately with such activities often comes improved infrastructure such as roads augmenting hunting opportunities (1). Sadly unlike several sifakas no taboos against hunting this species exist and many people in Madagascar view wild lemur meat as a delicacy (7).\xa0\xa0 \xa0,The silky sifaka is present in a few protected areas: the Anjanaharibe-Sud Special Reserve Marojejy National Park and more rarely the Anjanaharibe and Manandriana portions of the Makira Protected Area\xa0 (1) (7). Marojejy National Park forms part of the World Heritage Site \xe2\x80\x98The Rainforests of the Atsinanana\xe2\x80\x99 for which the silky sifaka is a flagship species (7) (8). It has been recommended that other areas of forest where the silky sifaka has been recorded should be protected (1). However as mentioned above the designation of protected areas does not always provide this Critically Endangered sifaka with the absolute protection it requires. A lack of awareness and understanding amongst local people of this sifaka\xe2\x80\x99s rarity and uniqueness is one obstacle in conservation efforts and as a result a conservation education programme took place in 2004 with encouraging results; many local people were interested in learning more about this species and showed concern for its plight (4). ,hunting; ,protected; ,1,1

Further changes to the climate caused by human activities may result in even greater reductions in the available habitat for this species (1).,The Sinai baton blue occurs entirely within the St Katherine Protectorate where rangers are monitoring this species by carrying out 9 to 14 survey days each year (7). Recent conservation efforts for the Sinai baton blue are mainly focused on preserving its endangered host plant with the Protectorate recently banning the collection of Sinai thyme with enforced fines. A fence has also been erected around a patch containing the largest butterfly population to prevent public access and stop further plant loss. Two dams have been built in this patch to hold more water in the soil and improve the condition of the thyme (1) (8). ,environment; , ,1,0

Curlews were a prime target due to their large size and slender-billed curlews may be tamer than other species making them easy targets (8). The threat of hunting remains and the continued loss and degradation of wetlands in the Mediterranean and North Africa as well as in the breeding and staging areas is also a serious threat (7). Population estimates made in 2000 put the number of slender-billed curlew at fewer than 50 individuals (7).,The slender-billed curlew is protected in the majority of range states through which it passes and is listed on Appendix I of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) (7). It is also listed on Appendix I of the Convention on Migratory Species (CMS) under which a Slender-billed Curlew Working Group (SbCWG) has been established in the framework of a \xe2\x80\x98CMS Memorandum of Understanding\xe2\x80\x99 for the species (5) (9).

Gyps indicus tenuirostris,Gyps tenuirostris,Slender-billed vulture (Gyps tenuirostris),Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Falconiformes,Accipitridae,Gyps (1),Length: 80 â 95 cm (2),Having suffered an extremely rapid decline in numbers due to a previously unknown cause the slender-billed vulture is in danger of imminent extinction without immediate conservation action. By 2000 dead and dying <i>Gyps</i> vultures were being found so frequently in Nepal and India it was thought that they were suffering from an epidemic. The unnaturally high death toll was thought to be caused by a fatal virus but testing has revealed that the vultures were suffering from kidney failure following the consumption of cattle that had previously been treated with the anti-inflammatory drug diclofenac (2). In fact the decline is a result of a lethal level of the drug in a small proportion of the <strong>ungulate</strong> carcasses available to vultures but as vultures travel long distances to reach <strong>carrion</strong> a considerable proportion of the population has been affected (7).,It is necessary to prevent exposure of vultures to livestock carcasses that have been contaminated with diclofenac and to find an alternative replacement drug (7). Government commitment to the control of the use of the drug is crucial but until it has been entirely removed from the environment a collaboration of bird protection organisations plan to take all slender-billed vultures into captivity for the next 20 to 30 years to avoid further deaths which would further reduce the chance of a successful recovery of this already rare species (8). ,loss; , ,1,0

Accidentally caught sawfish are rarely returned to the water alive as they are difficult to disentangle from nets and are dangerous to fishermen. Sawfish are purposefully caught for sport for food and for their oil which is used to make soap medicine and for polishing leather as well as for their saws which are removed and sold as curios. Habitat modification is also contributing to the decline of this species which is slow to recover from population crashes due to slow maturation and a long reproductive cycle (1) (2) (3).,Florida has established three wildlife refuges to protect the habitat of the smalltooth sawfish and in the hope that numbers might increase sufficiently for re-colonisation of other areas (3). It has been protected from harvesting in Florida since 1992 and over the rest of American waters since 2003 (5). Research into smalltooth sawfish life-history and population distribution as well as education and awareness initiatives may help to prevent further decline of this species but these efforts must be made worldwide to ensure the protection of this amazing fish (6). , ,protected; ,0,1

This species increasingly breeds near villages where conversion of the land to farmland is imminent and where additional threats such as predation by domestic animals are more likely. A further concern is the substantial increase in numbers of a predator of the sociable lapwing the rook <i>Corvus frugilegus</i>. Finally both the breeding and wintering grounds of this species have become drier which may be disrupting prey organism availability (2).,The sociable lapwing is legally protected in Armenia Kazakhstan Russia Turkmenistan Ukraine and Uzbekistan. Plans to survey the bird\xe2\x80\x99s movements in Kazakhstan should help to identify key threats. Protecting grassland <strong>steppe</strong> habitats regulating livestock numbers and managing colonies during the nesting period are all key aims in plans to conserve this species (2). , ,protected; ,0,1

The flesh of this species has a particularly high fat content and is prized in Japan especially for 'sashimi' markets (5) where an individual fish can fetch as much as US$ 10000 (4). Fishing mainly takes the form of <strong>purse seine netting</strong> in Australia (6) and longline fishing in the other range states; namely New Zealand Japan the Republic of Korea Taiwan and Indonesia (5).,In 1994 Australia Japan and New Zealand signed the Convention for the Conservation of Southern Bluefin Tuna in an attempt to curb the overfishing of this species (5). The Commission for the Conservation of the Southern Bluefin Tuna (CCSBT) has subsequently formed and in 2001 was joined by the Republic of Korea (5). The objective of the Commission is to ensure the conservation and optimum utilisation of the global southern bluefin tuna fishery through management measures including reduced fishing quotas and research (5). Some scientists and conservationists are worried however that the Commission does not go far enough and that global breeding stocks having been reduced by as much as 97% will require more drastic measures if they are ever to recover (6). ,fishing; , ,1,0

Pyxide Arachnoide; Tortue-araignÃ©e,Pyxis arachnoides,Spider tortoise (Pyxis arachnoides),Animalia,Chordata,Reptilia,Testudines,Testudinidae,Pyxis (1),Average shell length: 11.1 (2),This species\xe2\x80\x99 habitat has been seriously degraded with an estimated 1.2 percent loss in habitat per year. The main causes of habitat loss and degradation in Madagascar include human-caused fires conversion to agriculture charcoal production firewood exploitation and invasive alien plants (1) (11). Madagascar\xe2\x80\x99s burgeoning human population can only cause this problem to worsen (11).,The Critically Endangered spider tortoise is protected by national law in Madagascar and listed on Appendix I of CITES which prohibits international trade in this species. Unfortunately compliance with the law is proving difficult to enforce with large numbers leaving the country illegally to support the exotic pet trade (4) (5) as well as being hunted for food by certain communities within Madagascar. The spider tortoise\xe2\x80\x99s occurrence in two protected areas (Lake Tsimanampetsotsa National Park and Cap Sainte-Marie Special Reserve) offers some much needed protection but owing to a lack of resources within the protected areas system habitat destruction and poaching still continues (4) (14). The need for a specific conservation action plan has been raised in addition to stricter measures to protect its habitat and the implementation of education programmes to try and protect this tortoise from hunting (9).\xa0These measures in addition to ensuring that populations of all <strong>subspecies</strong> are represented within protected areas (1) (15) are essential if the long-term survival of the spider tortoise is to be assured. ,loss;invasive;pet; ,cites;protected; ,3,2

More recently trapping for the illegal bird trade has driven this parrot to extinction in the wild (4) (5).,Until 2001 the Spix\xe2\x80\x99s macaw recovery programme was coordinated and implemented through the Permanent Committee for the Recovery of the Spix\xe2\x80\x99s Macaw (CPRAA) composed of the Brazilian government scientific advisors and Spix\xe2\x80\x99s macaw holders (4). While the solitary male remained in the wild he was the subject of a number of study programmes and valuable information on the natural ecology and behaviour of this species was obtained (4). The wild male had mated with a blue-winged macaw (<em>Primoliismaracana</em>) and the pair successfully fostered blue-winged macaw nestlings which were introduced to them (4). This is an encouraging finding as wild blue-winged macaws could in theory be used to foster captive-bred Spix\xe2\x80\x99s macaws in the same way (4). The future of Spix\xe2\x80\x99s macaw depends on the success of the captive-bred population and its possible reintroduction into the wild. There have been recent problems however leading the Brazilian government to suspend CPRAA in 2001 due to internal conflicts (7). While the loss of Spix\xe2\x80\x99s macaw in the wild was a devastating blow to the conservation programme if the different parties can cooperate there is hope that a wild population of Spix\xe2\x80\x99s macaws can be successfully reintroduced. , , ,0,0

As with many coastal regions tidal mudflats are being reclaimed for industry or aquaculture. Pollution climate change and human disturbance have also altered the habitat of this species and hunting of shorebirds contributes to the decline of the spoon-billed sandpiper. Recent population surveys indicate an extremely rapid decline in this species with reduced productivity leading to fears that the population is ageing rapidly (2).,The spoon-billed sandpiper is protected in several areas throughout its range but would benefit from enforced legal protection wherever it is present. Shorebird hunting is prolific and affects many species; a ban would have wide-ranging benefits. A Species Action Plan was produced for the spoon-billed sandpiper in 2008 but urgent conservation action is now required to prevent its extinction (2). ,loss;hunting;pollution; ,protected; ,3,1
Animalia,Brachionichthys hirsutus,Spotted handfish (Brachionichthys hirsutus),Animalia,Chordata,Actinopterygii,Lophiiformes,Brachionichthyidae,Brachionichthys (1),Length: 10 - 15 cm (2),The spotted handfish was common in the lower Derwent River estuary until the mid 1980s when the species underwent a catastrophic decline (2). Although unproven it is thought that the introduction of the northern Pacific seastar (<i>Asterias amurensis</i>) to Tasmania at this time may be the key to the decimation of the handfish population (3). These seastars are voracious predators of shellfish and it is thought that they may also eat the eggs of handfish or the sea squirts upon which the eggs are attached (2). The deterioration of coastal habitats due to development may also be involved in the decline (3). This species is under added threat from its vastly reduced population limited dispersal restricted distribution and low reproductive rate (3).,Just two spotted handfish were reported between 1990 and 1994; this dire state of the population led to the formation of the Spotted Handfish Recovery Team in 1996 (3). The Recovery Team consists of a number of government agencies concerned with saving this rare and bizarre fish. Research into existing wild populations and the development of captive breeding techniques are some of the priorities of the recovery plan (3). Initial work has been encouraging with successful breeding attempts from two adult pairs of spotted handfish at the Tasmanian Department of Primary Industry and Fisheries Aquaculture (2). A captive population may be used in a future <strong>re-introduction</strong> programme to restore these fish to some of their previous range (6). , ,captive breeding; ,0,1

Plantae,Mellissia begonifolia,St Helena boxwood (Mellissia begonifolia),Plantae,Tracheophyta,Magnoliopsida,Solanales,Solanaceae,Mellissia (1),Height: 1 - 2 m (2),The island of St Helena has suffered over 450 years of human exploitation and has come to symbolise the environmental collapse of the world's oceanic islands. Today the landscape is altered beyond recognition and many of the <strong>endemic</strong> and unique species have been lost for ever (5). The introduction of goats and other livestock as well as the clearing of native forests for timber have ravaged the island; 60 percent of St Helena became barren ground known as the Crown Wastes following massive soil erosion (5). The St Helena boxwood appears to contain toxins that prevented it from being damaged by goats and therefore widespread erosion is likely to have been the main cause of its disappearance from the island (2).,Today all that survives of the St Helena boxwood are a precarious wild population and around 50 cultivated plants many situated at the Royal Botanic Gardens Kew in the UK (4). It is hoped that some of these will be returned to St Helena and <strong>re-introduced</strong> to the wild however early attempts at <strong>re-introduction</strong> have not proven successful and there is a lack of expertise on the island itself (4). Recent studies have revealed that there is no genetic variation amongst the remaining plants of this species providing a further predicament to the conservation drive as individuals will be less adaptable and more likely to succumb to pests (4). ,environmental;environment; , ,2,0
Plantae,Trochetiopsis ebenus,St Helena ebony (Trochetiopsis ebenus),Plantae,Tracheophyta,Magnoliopsida,Malvales,Sterculiaceae,Trochetiopsis (1),Height: up to 4 - 5 m (2),The native flora and fauna of St Helena have suffered centuries of exploitation and many of the <strong>endemic</strong> and unique species have been lost. The most striking example of the devastation that has occurred is an area known as the Crown Wastes a barren ground that has suffered massive erosion and covers 60 percent of the island (5). The St Helena ebony was once common in this area which stands as a pertinent warning of the effects of over-exploitation. Goats were introduced to the island in the early 16th Century in order to provide food for sailors passing through the area (4). Vast herds of wild goats roamed the island and fed on native plants such as the ebony; the low branches of this species made it highly accessible and seedlings were particularly vulnerable thus preventing population growth (4).,The St Helena ebony has proven easy to propagate and cuttings taken from the two remaining wild shrubs have been used to cultivate plants as part of the conservation programme for this species (4). Wild goats have been all but removed from the island following a concerted campaign in the 1960s (4). The ebony has been established in cultivation at two key sites: behind High Peak (not formerly within the range of the ebony) and Ebony Plain although limited regeneration has been observed at either site (3). There are currently around 2000 individuals (3) but these were all derived from the two remaining plants and subsequently have little genetic variation (4). At both sites the Ebony is planted with the hybrid <i>Trochetiopsis x benjaminii</i> Cronk also known as \xe2\x80\x98Rebony\xe2\x80\x99 and <strong>introgression</strong> is a possible threat (3). Smaller collections have been established at Scotland Pounceys and White\xe2\x80\x99s Cottage (Norman Williams Nature Reserve); in the latter two sites the hybrid is also planted (3). In addition the ebony is also in cultivation in private gardens usually derived from clonal material of the upper cliff plant (3). These cultivated populations are a mere shadow of the former glory of this species. , , ,0,0
Saint Helena plover; wirebird,Charadrius sanctaehelenae,St Helena plover (Charadrius sanctaehelenae),Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Charadriiformes,Charadriidae,Charadrius (1),Length: 15 cm (2),As a result of land management changes and introduced predators the population of the St Helena plover is critically low. A census carried out during 2005 and 2006 showed that this species had undergone a decline of more that 40 percent in just five years to a mere 235 individuals (3). There has since been a small increase in numbers however (6). The major factor suspected of causing the decline is a reduction in livestock grazing which has become unprofitable (2) and has led to longer grass swards and encroachment by shrubland (3). This is detrimental to breeding success as the birds rely on short swards in which to construct nests and forage. In addition to this threat growing populations of introduced predators are consuming large numbers of this species\xe2\x80\x99 eggs and chicks. To compound these existing problems there are now plans to build an airport on St Helena potentially reducing available habitat and causing further disturbance and degradation due to tourist activity. With its population currently at the lowest level ever recorded the St Helena plover is perilously close to extinction and will require careful management to ensure its survival (3).,Protected by law on St Helena since 1894 in recent years the plight of the St Helena plover has galvanised a significant amount of attention from researchers and conservationists (2) (3). Even the plan to construct the airport on St Helena has had some positive impact as it has reinforced efforts to find out more about this threatened bird\xe2\x80\x99s status and how it can be preserved (3). The airport mitigation process has also provided resources to allow restoration of some degraded but formerly important grassland habitat (6). , ,protected; ,0,1

Growing on or below rock outcrops the populations are vulnerable to chance factors and to competition from introduced plants. No regeneration has been observed at the High Hill site in the last 10 years (4).,The Environmental Conservation Section nursery at Scotland St Helena has raised a number of plants of St Helena rosemary and some of these have been planted out in private gardens to aid their survival (2). ,loss;pet; , ,2,0

Animalia,Acropora cervicornis,Staghorn coral (Acropora cervicornis),Animalia,Cnidaria,Anthozoa,Scleractinia,Acroporidae,Acropora (1),,Staghorn corals face the many threats that are impacting coral reefs globally. At present around one third of the world's reef-building corals are threatened with extinction. The principal threat to corals is the rise in sea temperature associated with global climate change. This leads to coral bleaching where the symbiotic algae are expelled leaving the corals weak and vulnerable to an increasing variety of harmful diseases. Climate change is also expected cause more extreme weather incidents and to increase ocean acidification which impairs the coral's ability to form a skeleton. These global threats are compounded by localised threats from pollution destructive fishing practices invasive species and human development (6).,Staghorn corals are listed on Appendix II of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) and therefore trade in this coral should be carefully regulated and a permit is required to bring the coral or objects made from them into the countries that have signed the CITES convention (2). Staghorn corals will also form part of the marine community in many marine protected areas or in areas where management plans are in place to protect the coral community. In some areas coral reefs restoration attempts are being undertaken; in Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary efforts have been made to reattach coral fragments or culture and settle coral larvae. Both activities have had limited success and new techniques are being pursued (5). ,fishing;environmental;environment;invasive;disease;pet;pollution; ,cites;protected; ,7,2

star sturgeon,Acipenser stellatus,Stellate sturgeon (Acipenser stellatus),Animalia,Chordata,Actinopterygii,Acipenseriformes,Acipenseridae,Acipenser (1),Length: up to 2.18 metres (2),The major threat to the stellate sturgeon\xe2\x80\x99s survival is overfishing for its meat and more significantly for caviar sold under the name \xe2\x80\x9csevruga\xe2\x80\x9d. This is produced from the sturgeon\xe2\x80\x99s unfertilised eggs and is almost always extracted by killing the female. The caviar industry is currently in crisis as the dwindling stocks of the stellate sturgeon and the other major caviar producing species can no longer provide sufficient caviar to meet the huge worldwide demand (2). Despite attempts to manage stellate sturgeon stocks illegal fishing and black market trade in caviar are threatening to drive this already endangered species to extinction (2) (7).,In 1998 the stellate sturgeon was listed by the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) meaning that all international trade in this species is controlled by maximum export quotas and trade permits (2) (3). The countries which are party to the CITES agreement must agree on sustainable catch and export quotas based on scientific surveys and must adopt regional conservation strategies and attempt to combat illegal fishing. The strict enforcement of these regulations meant that in 2006 caviar export was banned for all of the countries bordering the Caspian Sea since the countries failed to provide sufficient information about the sustainability of their catch. This promoted an agreement between the countries to reduce their stellate sturgeon caviar export quotas in 2007 by over 25 percent (8). The countries bordering the Black Sea have adopted an even stricter policy regarding their sturgeon stocks maintaining a zero quota policy which has continued into 2008 (9). Whether these reduced quotas will prove sufficient to allow the stellate sturgeon\xe2\x80\x99s population to recover remains to be seen. ,fishing;overfishing;pollution; ,cites; ,3,1

Today however the islands of Jolo and Sanga-sanga have been almost completely logged and have consequently suffered the local extinction of the Sulu hornbill (5). Logging in Tawitawi has also caused the deleterious decline of the species in its final stronghold. Hunting has also been a major cause of the destruction of this species; nestlings are collected annually for food and adults are reportedly shot on site either for food or target practice (5). The tiny population of Sulu hornbills that remain is on the verge of extinction; political unrest in the region continues to hamper conservation efforts (2).,The Sulu hornbill does not currently occur within any protected areas (4) and is in grave danger of disappearing before it has been properly studied. Research into the life history and biology of this rare bird are urgently needed along with survey work and protection measures (2). The Sulu hornbill is listed on Appendix II of the Conventional on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) and the Mindano State University have carried out some public awareness campaigns (5).

However the main threat to orangutans today is loss of habitat (7). In the past twenty years 80 percent of orangutan habitat has been lost to illegal logging gold mining and conversion to permanent agriculture in particular palm oil plantations. What is special about these animals is their unique vulnerability to exploitation. Much of this may be attributed to their extremely long inter-birth interval typically eight years making them the slowest breeding primates on earth (7).,The Sumatran orangutan is fully protected by law in Indonesia and is listed on Appendix I of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) which bans international trade in this species. The key to saving this species is protecting tracts of unexploited forest that are interconnected and contain sufficient habitat (8). A massive national park has been proposed in the north of Sumatra covering 25000 square kilometres and encompassing the existing Gunung Leuser National Park. The Leuser ecosystem will play a key role in protecting important refuges of the critically endangered Sumatran rhino (<i>Dicerorhinus sumatrensis</i>) elephant (<i>Elephas maximus sumatranus</i>) and tiger (<i>Panthera tigris sumatrae</i>) as well as the orangutan and numerous lesser-known species (8). Due to the large home ranges that these apes require it is the protection of habitat that will ensure that these beautiful and enigmatic 'people of the forest' survive into the next century (7). ,loss;pet; ,cites;protected; ,2,2

Today the small isolated populations that remain continue to be primarily threatened by poaching (1) as sadly the Sumatran rhinoceros is one of the unfortunate animals that is highly valued in traditional Asian medicines. Many parts of its body are believed to have aphrodisiac and medicinal properties but its distinctive horn is most in demand and ends up either a powdered ingredient in medicines or artistically carved (2) (5). The populations of the Sumatran rhinoceros are now so small that breeding has become a rare activity and successful births are infrequent; as a result <strong>inbreeding depression</strong> has become a real and serious risk (1). The small numbers mean that even the death of a single animal brings the species a step closer to extinction (5).,Despite being listed on Appendix I of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) since 1975 (which prohibits trade in the species) (3) and being legally protected in all the countries in which it occurs (1) the Sumatran rhinoceros is still in a precarious situation.

The Sunda pangolin is also threatened by the widespread habitat loss that has occurred throughout its range (1) (7).,The Sunda pangolin is listed on Appendix II of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) which means that international trade in this species is strictly regulated (3). This species is protected by wildlife laws in Myanmar Thailand Cambodia Vietnam Indonesia Singapore and Malaysia which are all regions where it is threatened by hunting although these laws are often not enforced to an appropriate degree (1). ,loss;hunting;poaching; ,cites;protected; ,3,2

Ghost frog; Roseâs ghost frog; Roseâs torrent frog; Skeleton Gorge ghost frog; thumbed ghost frog,Heleophryne rosei,Table Mountain ghost frog (Heleophryne rosei),Animalia,Chordata,Amphibia,Anura,Heleophrynidae,Heleophryne (1),Female snout-vent length: 60 mm (2)Male snout-vent length: 50 mm (2),Despite occurring within protected land the Table Mountain ghost frog is still subject to a number of threats each with the potential to have a devastating impact given this species\xe2\x80\x99 narrow range. The spread of alien vegetation and in particular the planting of exotic pines gums and poplars has resulted in the clogging of streams creating areas of stagnant water unsuitable for the Table Mountain ghost frog. Consequently even within its restricted range it has become locally extinct along certain stretches. Other potential threats include the construction of dams which reduce water flow frequent fires global climate change and intensive eco-tourism while in recent years the deadly fungal disease chytridiomycosis has been found in some populations of this Critically Endangered species (1) (2) (3).,The whole of the Table Mountain ghost frog\xe2\x80\x99s range is incorporated within the Table Mountain National Park itself a part of the Cape Floristic World Heritage Site (1) (4). Given this species imperilled conservation status Western Cape Nature Conservation also has a monitoring programme in place (1). One of the main conservation priorities is to ensure the preservation of swift-flowing perennial mountain streams on Table Mountain. Furthermore with the looming threat of further cases of chytridiomycosis spreading through the population the establishment of a captive population may prove vital to this species survival (2) (3). ,disease; , ,1,0
Tahiti flycatcher,Pomarea nigra,Tahiti monarch (Pomarea nigra),Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Monarchidae,Pomarea (1),Length: 15 cm (2),The Tahiti monarch used to be common throughout the island but during the last century populations underwent a dramatic decrease and now number less than 50 restricted to a few valleys. These perilous declines have largely been the result of the accidental introduction of the black rat (<i>Rattus rattus</i>) to the island which prey on the eggs and chicks. However two introduced birds the Indian mynah and red-vented bulbul also pose a significant threat to the monarch\xe2\x80\x99s survival. It is thought that the Indian mynah which was introduced to control wasps preys on eggs and chicks whereas the red-vented bulbul competes with the monarch for nest sites and territories (5).,In 1997 the total population was only 27 individuals. Since then a conservation programme was implemented and intensive surveys revealed the population had increased to 40 to 45 birds in 2004 (2) (3). The recovery plan is largely focused on the control of the black rat. During each breeding season a rat-baiting programme takes place on accessible Tahiti monarch territories (12 territories in 2006); the remainder live in remote areas that are extremely difficult to access. Trees which hold Tahiti monarch nests are fitted with metal rings to protect the nests from climbing rats and since 2001 the population has been stable or very slowly increasing and old territories are being reoccupied (6). ,invasive;pet; , ,2,0
Animalia,Apalis fuscigularis,Taita apalis (Apalis fuscigularis),Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Cisticolidae,Apalis (1),10 - 12 g (3),Most of the original forest of the Taita Hills has now been lost either to cultivation or to plantations of non-native timber trees. The Taita apalis is thought to be confined to just five of the remaining tiny isolated forest fragments and these fragments are still under serious threat from agriculture plantations firewood extraction and cattle grazing which may prevent natural regeneration (2) (3) (5) (7) (8). Although now protected a lack of clear boundary demarcations can make it difficult to effectively conserve these forest fragments and wildfires are also a threat in some areas (2). This highly endangered bird was believed to number no more than 600 to 930 individuals in 2001 (2) (6) (7) and its population is fragmented into tiny isolated subpopulations (2) putting it at increased risk of extinction. Alarmingly surveys in 2009 and 2010 indicated a major crash in the remaining population with possibly only 60 to 130 birds now remaining although the causes of this dramatic decline are unclear (4). As it lives close to the maximum altitude within its range climate change is a potential threat as it could leave the Taita apalis with nowhere to move to if local conditions change (2).,Fortunately for the Taita apalis a range of conservation activities are now underway in the Taita Hills. The remaining forest fragments are being safeguarded by the Kenya Forest Department while Nature Kenya is committed to conservation in the area (2). An international research project is ongoing which includes studies into the Taita apalis (2) (9) and conservation actions include reforestation plans to reconnect forest patches and the development of alternative income-generating activities such as bee-keeping and butterfly-rearing. Local farmers have also been taught about responsible agricultural practices and tree nurseries have been established to provide native trees for restoring degraded habitat and fast-growing non-native trees to create buffer zones and to reduce pressure on the native forest (2) (6) (7). , , ,0,0
Turdus olivaceus helleri,Turdus helleri,Taita thrush (Turdus helleri),Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Turdidae,Turdus (1),Length: 20-22 cm (2),Decades of forest clearance for cultivation and non-native timber plantations have reduced the indigenous forest of the Taita Hills to a tiny fraction of its former range. Today the surviving forest patches on which the highly specialised Taita thrush depends remain under serious threat from clearance and degradation. As a result the Taita thrush is currently listed as Critically Endangered on the IUCN Red List. One of the smaller sub-populations also has a highly male-biased sex ratio which might have significant consequences for the subpopulation\xe2\x80\x99s long term survival\xa0(2)\xa0(3)\xa0(6) (7).,In cooperation with local communities considerable conservation work is underway in the Taita Hills. In order to restore existing forest fragments and hopefully enhance connectivity between them efforts are being made to reforest areas with indigenous seedlings. Farmers are also being educated in environmentally responsible agricultural practices and local people are being taught alternative income generating activities such as bee-keeping and butterfly rearing. In addition an ongoing collaborative research project is in place which will provide the ecological data necessary to implement appropriate conservation measures. As part of future conservation measures a translocation project for the most threatened subpopulation of the Taita thrush is being developed\xa0(2)\xa0(3)\xa0(6). , , ,0,0

Sport hunting poaching for food and habitat destruction have all been cited as the causes behind the tamaraw\xe2\x80\x99s precarious present day situation (5) as well as an outbreak of <strong>rinderpest</strong> in the Philippines in the 1930s (5).  Its head was once a valued trophy of hunters and many local people depended on it as a source of meat (4).,Despite significant efforts to protect the tamaraw numbers remain alarmingly low (6).  The tamaraw is fully protected under Philippine law (1) and the Iglit-Baco National Park (now also known as the Mangyan Heritage Park (5)) was established for its protection (2) although this area is not exempt from being impacted by the threats mentioned above.  In 1979 the Tamaraw Conservation Program was initiated with the aim of safeguarding the tamaraw and its habitat undertaking population and habitat surveys reforestation programs and educational campaigns although there is some concern over how well any of these measures have been so far been achieved (6). ,hunting;poaching;disease; ,protected; ,3,1

The population of this species is thought to total no more than 600 individuals and is at risk from the effects of inbreeding (1).,The most important conservation measure for the Tenerife speckled lizard is the control of <strong>feral</strong> cat populations. Measures so far have included the use of fencing to exclude <strong>feral</strong> cats from the known habitat of the Tenerife speckled lizard (1). Future control measures of <strong>feral</strong> cat populations need to take into account the potential for inadvertently casing rat numbers to increase through the removal of their main predator (6). , ,protected; ,0,1

The total population may number only around 200 to 250 individuals and is fragmented into small subpopulations which are unable to interbreed (1) (6) (7) (8) (11). As with many of Vietnam\xe2\x80\x99s primates (8) hunting is the most immediate threat to this species (1) (2) (6) (14). Although described as bad-tasting and not the main target of hunting trips the Tonkin snub-nosed monkey is still commonly shot when encountered and is either consumed or used in traditional medicine (1) (8) (11) (14). Groups often do not flee from hunters making the species particularly vulnerable to being shot (1) (8) (12).,International trade in the Tonkin snub-nosed monkey is prohibited under its listing on Appendix I of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) (5). The Tonkin snub-nosed monkey is also protected by law in Vietnam making it illegal to kill capture or trade in the species and is listed as Critically Endangered on the Red Data Book of Vietnam (11). The Tonkin snub-nosed monkey occurs in at least two protected areas Na Hang and Cham Chu Nature Reserves and may also occur in others although populations in these areas are still under threat and continuing to decline despite conservation efforts (1) (6) (8) (11). A population occurring in Khau Ca an isolated forest within the buffer zone of the Du Gia Nature Reserve will likely benefit from the creation of a Species and Habitat Conservation Area (1) (6) (11) (15) whilst a range of conservation activities have been put in place by Fauna &amp; Flora International for a newly discovered population in Quan Ba District near the border with China (7) (15). ,loss;fragmentation;hunting; ,cites;captive breeding;protected; ,3,3

These factors continue to threaten this species today (1).,The Trinidad piping guan has been legally protected since 1963 and international trade in the species is banned by its listing on Appendix I of CITES (2). Much of the present range is within forest reserves but the laws protecting both the species and the habitat are generally poorly enforced (2). Recent campaigns appear to be finally changing attitudes and species-specific ecotourism may have a role to play in the future of this species (2). Presently however the population is extremely small (estimated at around 200 individuals) (2) and time to save this species may be running out. ,hunting; ,cites;protected; ,1,2
Diomedea exulans dabbenena,Diomedea dabbenena,Tristan albatross (Diomedea dabbenena),Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Procellariiformes,Diomedeidae,Diomedea (1),Length: 110 cm (2)Wingspan: up to 3.5 m (2),The Tristan albatross is in grave danger of becoming extinct in the foreseeable future with numbers having decreased by 28 percent over 46 years on Gough Island disappeared almost entirely on Inaccessible Island and already become extinct on Tristan da Cunha. The dramatic decline in numbers on Inaccessible Island is attributed to predation by feral pigs (now absent) and humans while the extinction on Tristan was probably the result of human exploitation in addition to predation by rats. On Gough storms have caused peat slips that have buried and killed nesting adults although this is likely to be only a very rare occurrence (3). The main threat comes from <strong>bycatch</strong> from longline fisheries with satellite tracking indicating a substantial overlap between the range of these birds and areas where longline fisheries are well known for their high rates of seabird bycatch mortality (3) (9). Furthermore if one parent is lost at sea the other cannot cope with the food demands of their chick and the chick will most probably die. Astonishing recent research has also shown that invasive introduced house mice three times the size of those in Europe are also devastating seabird populations on Gough Island by preying upon chicks (3) (10). The chicks are up to 250 times the weight of the mice but are largely immobile and defenceless the species having evolved over millions of years on an island with no natural predators (10). Approximately 1000 Tristan albatross chicks are thought to be killed each year by these seemingly unlikely predators (10). In fact a recent survey has shown that in 2008 the number of Tristan albatross chicks that have gone on to fledge is five times lower than it should be.,The Tristan albatross is listed on Annex 1 of the Agreement on the Conservation of Albatrosses and Petrels (ACAP) which seeks to coordinate activity to mitigate known threats to albatrosses. Gough and Inaccessible Island are nature reserves and together form a World Heritage Site. Both islands are uninhabited apart from a meteorological station on Gough. Satellite tracking monitors the dispersal of these birds which helps provide information on the potential impact of longline fisheries. Educating fisheries about mitigation measures to reduce <strong>bycatch</strong> mortality is an ongoing conservation priority for all albatross species (3). ,invasive; , ,1,0

At the time of its discovery it was one of the most sought-after cacti. Artificial propagation in high numbers made it quickly available to collectors although wild plants and possibly seeds were still exported illegally from Mexico. Nowadays plants seedlings and seeds of cultivated origin are quite common but wild populations have suffered significantly from illegal collection with the plants having drastically diminished in number at the more accessible sites near the road (5). The wild population is currently estimated at around 5000 individuals restricted to just one tiny area and its numbers have more than halved since the species\xe2\x80\x99 discovery (1).,<em>Turbinicarpus alonsoi </em>is listed on Appendix I of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) which includes species threatened with extinction which are or may be affected by trade.

Much of the terrain within its range is too steep for cultivation but nevertheless the main threat to this shrike remains the extensive loss of forest habitat due to clearance for cultivation and cutting for timber and firewood. Most of this destruction has occurred at lower elevations in the <strong>submontane forest</strong> the preferred habitat of this species\xa0(2)\xa0(3)\xa0(4)\xa0(5) (8). A further threat introduced to the area more recently is banana farming with bananas planted beneath the forest canopy as a cash crop\xa0(3)\xa0(4) (9). Unfortunately this involves clearing shrubs and thinning the trees as well as gradually felling further trees to provide additional nutrients for the banana plants. Eventually this process destroys the forest with the land then usually converted to subsistence maize farming\xa0(9).,Uluguru North and Uluguru South Forest Reserves are managed as important water catchment areas for the 3.5 million people of the city of Dar-es-Salaam and are also of high importance in terms of biodiversity\xa0(2)\xa0(5)\xa0(8)\xa0(9). There are plans underway to reconnect the two reserves and to upgrade them to the status of Nature Reserve\xa0(2)\xa0(5)\xa0(7) and a range of conservation projects are underway in the area including work with local communities habitat restoration further surveys of the Uluguru bush-shrike population and monitoring of the species\xe2\x80\x99 preferred habitat\xa0(2)\xa0(7)\xa0(8)\xa0(9). The development of ecotourism may also provide an alternative source of income for local people and an incentive to protect the forest\xa0(8)\xa0(9). Further conservation measures recommended for this rare <strong>endemic</strong> bird include additional monitoring and population estimates increased efforts to reduce firewood and timber harvesting within the reserves reforestation at lower elevations raising awareness of the importance of the area and continuing to work closely with local communities to ensure the appropriate management and sustainable utilisation of forest resources\xa0(2)\xa0(5)\xa0(8). ,loss; , ,1,0

Currently those threats come in the form of habitat degradation and hunting. As tourism on the island of Utila increases the mangrove forest habitat of the spiny-tailed iguana is being cleared for the construction of houses and marinas and used as a garbage dump site (1). Beaches are also being affected with some beaches being sold for the development of houses hotels and road construction and other beach areas becoming covered with introduced invasive plants creating a habitat unsuitable for egg-laying (1). In addition despite being protected by Honduran law this rare reptile is still hunted locally for its meat (1).,Tremendous conservation efforts have been initiated for the Utila spiny-tailed iguana in an attempt to prevent its extinction. In 1994 the Frankfurt Zoological Society and the Senckenberg Nature Research Society together initiated work to preserve the Utila spiny-tailed iguana. As well as conserving the iguana and its mangrove habitat the project aimed to promote the sustainable development of the island and create environmental awareness among the local inhabitants (3). ,hunting;invasive; ,captive breeding;protected; ,2,2

Animalia,Valencia hispanica,Valencia toothcarp (Valencia hispanica),Animalia,Chordata,Actinopterygii,Cyprinodontiformes,Cyprinodontidae,Valencia (1),Female length: 71 mm (2)Male length: 67 mm (2),The population of the Valencia toothcarp has undergone a decline of more than 80 percent in the past 10 years which is mainly attributable to the introduction of a non-native species but also as a result of habitat loss and degradation (1) (7). In the early 20th century the eastern mosquitofish <i>Gambusia holbrooki</i> was introduced to the <strong>Iberian Peninsula</strong> in order to control malaria. The fish were not only successful in preying upon the mosquito larvae found in the wetland water bodies but were also more efficient at foraging than the native Valencia toothcarp. The invasive fish were therefore able to out-compete the Valencia toothcarp for resources during periods of scarcity and have promoted the native species\xe2\x80\x99 decline (7). This has been compounded by the increasing habitat loss and degradation predominantly fuelled by the fact that the Valencia toothcarp\xe2\x80\x99s range is a popular tourist destination. Many areas of this species\xe2\x80\x99 wetland habitat have been drained to make way for development and to reduce mosquito breeding grounds (3) while the remainder are affected by urban and agricultural pollution (1). At present the Valencia toothcarp is perilously close to extinction with just ten wild populations of which only five have favourable conservation status (2),The Valencia toothcarp is listed in the Annexes II and IV of the European Union Habitats Directive and in the Appendix II of the Bern Convention both of which require that efforts are made to protect this species and its habitat (1). In order to fulfil this requirement three European action programmes have been developed to create a reserve network within this the Valencia toothcarp\xe2\x80\x99s range. In addition since 1993 extensive reintroductions have been carried out restocking regions from which this species was previously extirpated. Nevertheless further protection is still required for the remaining wild populations along with the continuation of reintroductions and implementation of educational programmes to raise awareness of this threatened species\xe2\x80\x99 plight (2). ,loss;invasive;pet;pollution; , ,4,0
Animalia,Marmota vancouverensis,Vancouver Island marmot (Marmota vancouverensis),Animalia,Chordata,Mammalia,Rodentia,Sciuridae,Marmota (1),3.0 - 6.5 kg (4),Natural <strong>successional processes</strong> are probably responsible for the original scarcity of the Vancouver Island marmot through tree encroachment in the alpine meadows it inhabits. The main causes of the recent severe decline are thought to be the disruption of the habitat due to logging activities weather fluctuations and increases in deer numbers which can cause an influx of predators. (4).,The Vancouver Island marmot gained legal protection under the British Columbia Wildlife Act in 1980 and a recovery team was set up in 1988 to devise a Recovery Plan (2). A captive breeding programme is now underway with the help of Toronto Zoo (3) and reintroductions are planned. , ,captive breeding; ,0,1
cochito; Gulf of California harbour porpoise; Gulf of California porpoise; Gulf porpoise,Phocoena sinus,Vaquita (Phocoena sinus),Animalia,Chordata,Mammalia,Cetartiodactyla,Phocoenidae,Phocoena (1),Average male length: 134.9 cm (2)Average female length: 140.6 cm (2),It was estimated in 2007 that only around 150 vaquita remained in the world (4); a number that is declining rapidly as the species is impacted by significant threats (7). The upper Gulf of California is not only home to this Critically Endangered species it is also the site of intensive commercial and artisanal fishing (7). Vaquitas become entangled in the gill nets and trawl nets that are used in these activities claiming the lives of an estimated 39 to 84 vaquitas each year (2). This is considered the principal threat to the vaquita\xe2\x80\x99s survival (7).,Time is quickly running out for the vaquita with a group of scientists in 2007 stating that they believed there were only two years remaining in which to find a solution to saving this species (4). Some measures have already been implemented; the Mexican government created the Upper Gulf of California and Colorado River Delta Biosphere Reserve in 1993 to protect the vaquita and other endangered species (2). In 2005 the Government also created a vaquita reserve the area of which partially overlaps with the Biosphere Reserve (10). A ban on gillnet fishing is currently being enforced within the vaquita reserve but gillnetting and shrimp trawling continues in the Biosphere Reserve and elsewhere within the range of vaquita (10) (11). Whilst these are incredibly important steps in the battle to save the vaquita if conservation efforts are not increased substantially the vaquita will become extinct (7). ,loss;fishing; , ,2,0

Sadly the species\xe2\x80\x99 large size deems it an easy target for hunters while its slow reproductive rate and generally low population densities makes it especially vulnerable to population collapses as a result of over-hunting (4). The habitat of the hybrid spider monkey (<i>A. h. hybridus</i>) is patchily distributed and there is a concern that few populations remain that are of an adequate size to be viable in the mid to long term. Populations are failing to be actively managed even within protected areas. However the brown spider monkey (<i>A. h. brunneus</i>) does not occur in any protected area and its population size is thought to be much smaller than that of the nominate subspecies (1). The brown spider monkey (<i>A. h. brunneus</i>) has a small geographic range where forest loss degradation and fragmentation are unfortunately widespread. Thus this subspecies has been officially recognised in 2004 and 2006 as one of the world\xe2\x80\x99s 25 most endangered primates (4).,The hybrid spider monkey (<i>A. h. hybridus</i>) is known to occur in 4 protected areas: Catatumbo-Bar\xc3\xad El Cocuy National Park and Tam\xc3\xa1 National Park in Colombia and Guatopo National Park in Venezuela (2). Although not in any protected areas a refuge remains for the brown spider monkey (<i>A. h. brunneus</i>) in the Serran\xc3\xada de San Lucas in southern Bol\xc3\xadvar which has been identified as an important site for the potential establishment of a national park. A park in the Serran\xc3\xada San Lucas would protect a number of species <strong>endemic</strong> to the region including two other threatened primate species the white-footed tamarin (<i>Saguinus leucopus</i>) and woolly monkey (<i>Lagothrix lagothricha lugens</i>). However the region has been a centre of civil unrest for years and census work there would be hazardous since guerilla groups have placed anti-personnel mines in some parts of the mountain range. Although limiting opportunities for surveys and conservation work this civil unrest has proved to be a double-edged sword since it is also probably the reason why forest is still remaining considering the insatiable destruction of the forests elsewhere across the country (4). ,loss;fragmentation;hunting; ,protected; ,3,1

Deforestation in the Philippines has been widespread and habitat loss along with hunting pressure is one of the main causes of the precipitous decline in numbers. Interbreeding with domestic pigs provides a further threat to the few surviving populations and it seems unlikely that purebred forms will persist in the wild for long (4). These pigs also suffer from persecution by local farmers who view the animals as pests; they are subject to high levels of illegal hunting pressure for local consumption are caught in pitfall traps or wire snares and may sometimes be killed with explosive devices that are baited and buried in the ground to be excavated by rooting individuals (6).,The Visayan Warty Pig Conservation Programme was established in 1991 (4) with the long-term aim of reintroducing 'warties' into areas from which they have been lost (3). Two captive breeding and rescue centres have been established on Negros one by Silliman University and another at the Negros Forests and Ecological Foundation (4). In addition a centre has been established on the island of Panay by the College of Agriculture and Forestry; as of June 2001 the total captive population for the species was 41 (4). The Visayan Warty Pig Conservation Programme is also involved with research into these poorly understood pigs and works to increase local awareness of the issues involved. The Philippines has more species of wild pig than any other nation however most of these are severely endangered and habitat loss and hunting are rife; the efforts to save the Visayan warty pig are a battle against time (3). ,loss;hunting; ,captive breeding; ,2,1

Shifting agriculture has cleared vast areas of forest and development and plantations have also played a part in habitat loss (7). In 1988 it was estimated that only four percent of Negros and eight percent of Panay remained forested (4). These birds have also been hunted for food and for collection for the pet trade in parts of their range and the isolated fragments of populations that remain are extremely vulnerable to any chance events such as the local failure of fruiting trees (4).,In 2001 the Visayan wrinkled hornbill was on the brink of extinction with only 60 to 80 breeding pairs remaining in the wild (8) (9). Fortunately effective conservation measures initiated by the Philippine Endemic Species Conservation Project (PESCP) saw the number of occupied nest holes on Panay increase to 1108 in 2008 (9). This was achieved primarily through a highly successful nest guarding scheme involving local communities (8) (9). Although it is not known how many Visayan wrinkled hornbills remain on Negros if any at all the success of the conservation measures on Panay offer considerable hope for the future of this species (8). ,loss;pet; , ,2,0

Animalia,Telmatobius espadai,Water frog (Telmatobius espadai),Animalia,Chordata,Amphibia,Anura,Leptodactylidae,Telmatobius (1),Length: 5 cm (2),<em>Telmatobius espadai </em>is now an extremely rare species; a population census undertaken in 1998 found just one tadpole. This tadpole showed symptoms of chytridiomycosis a disease that causes death in frogs and is thought to contribute to declines and even extinctions in frog species around the world (1) (6). There are also significant concerns over the possible effects of a road situated very near to one of the locations where the frog has been located (1). In addition various species of water frog are sometimes consumed as part of drink with supposed aphrodisiac qualities and this may also have contributed to the decline of this species (7).,Despite <em>Telmatobius espadai </em>being classified as Critically Endangered by the IUCN Red List there are presently no known conservation methods in place for this species and no current information on its status. The Rio Apaza population is located on the edges of the Carrasco National Park and if it persists it will hopefully benefit from this proximity (1) (3). ,disease; , ,1,0

Many are unintentionally drowned by longline fishing boats; a fishing method that involves a single line up to 130 kilometres long with thousands of baited hooks attached to it being pulled behind a boat. Waved albatrosses scavenging in the ocean try to eat the bait from the line as it is set behind the boat but instead swallow the hooks and are dragged under and drowned (7). Currently waved albatross are only affected by longlining when feeding off the coast of Peru as industrial longline fishing is prohibited in the Galapagos Marine Reserve. However there is pressure from the fishing industry to allow longlining within the reserve which would have an extremely damaging impact on the population of waved albatross (8).,Espa\xc3\xb1ola is part of the Gal\xc3\xa1pagos National Park and Marine Reserve and World Heritage Site which means that this breeding site of the waved albatross is well protected. There are no introduced species on the island and tourism is well regulated. The other potential breeding site the Isla de la Plata is part of Machalilla National Park but does not have the same level of protection as Espa\xc3\xb1ola and therefore the albatross could benefit from increased protection of this island (5). ,fishing;pollution; ,protected; ,2,1

Animalia,Rhizopsammia wellingtoni,Wellingtonâs solitary coral (Rhizopsammia wellingtoni),Animalia,Cnidaria,Anthozoa,Scleractinia,Dendrophylliidae,Rhizopsammia (1),,Before 1982 Wellington\xe2\x80\x99s solitary coral was considered to be abundant at some sites.  Then the <strong>El Ni\xc3\xb1o</strong> event of 1982 and 1983 struck which destroyed most colonies of this species except for colonies at Cousins and Gordons Rocks.  Yet since 2000 Wellington\xe2\x80\x99s solitary coral has not been found even around these two small islets despite targeted searches.  The dramatic loss of this species since the <strong>El Ni\xc3\xb1o</strong> event suggests that this coral is particularly sensitive to changes to the temperature of the water in which they live and hints at their vulnerability to the effects of global climate change (1).,The unique biodiversity of the Gal\xc3\xa1pagos Islands and the surrounding waters is recognised and valued and thus the region is protected by being designated a Marine Reserve and World Heritage Site (1).  Wellington\xe2\x80\x99s solitary coral is also included in Appendix II of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) meaning that any international trade in this species should be carefully regulated (2).

From 1992 to 2007 it is thought that around one third of the total population found in protected areas was killed by this lethal virus (1). Increasingly the trade in bushmeat is posing more of a threat to the survival of the species and cleared forests are ever more accessible to hunters. The demand for meat has increased from both road labourers and a growing urban market (7). Western gorillas are very susceptible to the illegal bushmeat trade as gorilla meat is viewed as a symbol of wealth and prestige (8). Male gorillas will actively defend their females and offspring if their group encounters a threat and this increases their chances of being killed by a hunter (8).,The western gorilla is listed on Appendix I of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) (3) and there has been a decline in international trade of the species (4). The United Nations Environmental Program (UNEP) has recognised the urgent need to protect our closest relatives and has established a Great Ape Survival Project (GRASP) aimed at identifying the conservation initiatives required to secure the future of the apes and at obtaining political support and funding to allow these to be achieved (9). ,loss; ,cites; ,1,1

Today however the western swamp turtle is Critically Endangered and the population at Twin Swamps became extinct in 1985 (4). The swamps of this turtles' habitat have been drained and filled in for agricultural purposes greatly reducing the available range (6). In addition the population at Twin Swamps in particular suffered from predation by the introduced red fox (<i>Vulpes vulpes</i>); <strong>aestivating</strong> individuals protected only by leaf litter are especially vulnerable (6).,The two remaining swamps containing this species were made into nature reserves in 1962 and a captive breeding programme at Perth Zoo has been running since 1988 (6). The captive population has been used to re-establish a viable population of western swamp turtles within the Twin Swamps Reserve (4). A fox-proof fence has been constructed around remaining swamps to provide further protection (4). The Western Swamp Turtle Recovery Plan has been running since 1992 it aims to at least double the population of this rare turtle in 10 years and to establish a captive population of at least 50 individuals (4). , ,captive breeding; ,0,1

In the Philippines large areas of forest had already been cleared by the end of the nineteenth century for agricultural expansion which continued throughout the twentieth century (7). However the most extensive and rapid deforestation in the latter half of the century has been caused by commercial logging with has particularly impacted the valuable primary lowland dipterocarp forests which shrunk from an estimated 10 million hectares in the 1950s to only one million by the late 1980s (7). Forest clearance and habitat degradation throughout Borneo and the Philippines may also be having a detrimental effect on the tree\xe2\x80\x99s natural pollinators reducing the rate at which the species can reproduce and recover its populations (4).,This threatened species is located in a proposed reserve site (1) which if awarded official reserve status in the future would confer some degree of protection to the species. The Philippines\xe2\x80\x99 Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR) has also established a <strong>genebank</strong> of economically useful <strong>endemic</strong> and endangered forest tree species including white seraya (8). This project has involved collecting and propagating the species to be maintained in an arboretum and gathering data on growth and survival of the species planted (8). A large scale project has also been initiated in Sabah Malaysia to rehabilitate 25000 hectares of logged forests using indigenous tree species such as dipterocarps in order to counteract atmospheric carbon dioxide (9). <i>Parashorea malaanonan</i> has been one of the main dipterocarp species planted to date (9). Indeed although such conservation efforts are not directed specifically at white seraya the tree is likely to benefit indirectly from a variety of such efforts to conserve lowland forests generally. Whether for environmental concerns or to protect the host of endangered species that inhabit lowland forests across Borneo and the Philippines conservation of such forests will undoubtedly help preserve this enormous tree which needs to be recognised for its crucial ecological importance as much as for its economic value. , , ,0,0

However in the past five years the use of peat by humans has increased for use in activities such as mushroom-growing and gardening and this peat is extracted from the bogs which are inhabited by the white-bellied cinclodes. Due to the cinclodes\xe2\x80\x99 apparently very specific habitat requirements the activities of humans in towns and cities could reduce the survival chances of this species high-up in the mountains (2) (3).,The white-bellied cinclodes occurs within Jun\xc3\xadn National Reserve and has been the focus of a few recent studies attempting to estimate the species\xe2\x80\x99 population (2).

The <strong>Atlantic coastal forest</strong> of Brazil is highly threatened by habitat loss mainly in the form of clearance for sugarcane and coffee plantations and pressure from urbanisation (7) (8) (13). Within this species\xe2\x80\x99 range massive deforestation has drastically reduced forest cover to less than one percent of its former extent and the small remaining forest fragments are under continued threat from logging as well as from fires (3) (10). In addition a lack of knowledge about the white-collared kite whose very existence as a distinct species was still debated as recently as 2005 hinders efforts to conserve it (5) (6) (8).\xa0,The white-collared kite is listed on Appendix II of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) meaning that any international trade in the species should be carefully monitored (4). In addition a large area of Murici Alagoas is legally protected and organisations such as the Instituto para a Preserva\xc3\xa7\xc3\xa3o da Mata Atl\xc3\xa2ntica (IPMA) are working to create forest reserves on privately-owned land (3) (10). Further surveys and research into the white-collared kite are urgent priorities (3) (6) (10) and studies have been recommended to clarify its <strong>taxonomic</strong> status using genetic analysis (3). The designation of Murici as a biological reserve and the protection of other forest areas (3) (10) (13) such as Mata do Coimbra Ibateguara Alagoas (12) will also be important to its continued survival. Birds of prey make ideal charismatic \xe2\x80\x98flagship\xe2\x80\x99 species for conservation (6) and so any efforts to conserve this highly endangered kite would also be likely to benefit many of the other threatened species that share its fragile habitat. ,loss; ,cites;protected; ,1,2

The focus of conservation efforts must fall primarily on the Cat Ba Island <strong>subspecies</strong> with possibly as few as 59 individuals remaining today. This shockingly low number is the result of a massive 98% decline over the course of 40 years from between 2500 and 2800 individuals in the 1960s to just 53 in 2000. Such a dangerously small population of Cat Ba langurs gives the impression that the Chinese <strong>subspecies</strong> <i>Trachypithecus poliocephalus leucocephalus</i> is thriving with between 600 and 800 individuals alive today. This is of course far from the truth particularly as declines were recorded in the populations at Longgang National Nature Reserve and the Fusui Rare and Precious Animal Reserve in 1998 (5).,With just 53 Cat Ba langurs in the wild and two in captivity at the Endangered Primate Rescue Centre of Cuc Phuong National Park the Cat Ba Langur Conservation Project was started in 2000 by M\xc5\xb1nster Zoo and the Zoological Society for the Conservation of Species and Populations (ZGAP). Given the cause of the langur\xe2\x80\x99s decline the main aim of the project was to halt poaching with the additional intention of promoting conservation awareness amongst the inhabitants of Cat Ba Island. The project has been extremely successful in dramatically reducing deaths as a result of poaching bringing the number from 30 deaths in the eight months prior to its start to three deaths in the first four years of the project. In this time nine langurs were born and have survived. The langurs are closely monitored and protection measures are in place particularly in the newly created langur sanctuary within the National Park. This highly protected area is home to 20 individuals from a large reproducing group which are protected by a rotation of 20 rangers \xe2\x80\x93 an incredible ratio of one ranger to one langur. The sanctuary is visibly marked around its circumference and is inaccessible to tourists. The Cat Ba Langur Conservation Project has constructed two new ranger stations provided boats to ease patrols and has even seen the voluntary relocation of several local floating households to support the rangers (3). The Cat Ba langur also has the support of Flora and Fauna International\xe2\x80\x99s Flagship Species Fund (5) and the Cat Hai District Women\xe2\x80\x99s Union who implemented a project entitled \xe2\x80\x98Contributing to Biodiversity Conservation in Cat Ba National Park through Community Activity\xe2\x80\x99 (7). ,fragmentation;hunting; ,protected; ,2,1

Much of the species\xe2\x80\x99 historical decline is due to habitat loss through logging of lowland forest and drainage of wetlands for agriculture (most of the Mekong floodplain in southern Laos has been converted to rice-paddy) livestock-grazing grass-harvesting and development. Habitat destruction has been compounded by hunting for food and human disturbance which now pose the greatest threats to the species (2).,The white-shouldered ibis is legally protected in Indonesia Myanmar and East Malaysia (4) and occurs in several protected areas including Cat Tien National Park Vietnam where it probably breeds Ang Trapeang Thmor Cambodia and Xe Pian National Biodiversity Conservation Area (NBCA) and Dong Khanthung proposed NBCA Laos (2). BirdLife International's Cambodia Programme Office is working with relevant government departments to promote Western Siem Pang as a protected area a site that supports the only known potentially viable population (up to 70 individuals) of white-shouldered ibis in mainland Southeast Asia and which contains three other Critically Endangered birds. In partnership with local communities ongoing public awareness campaigns are being conducted in Laos and Cambodia to educate people about the status of these bird populations discourage persecution and establish activities to prevent further population declines (5). The governments of Laos and Vietnam are also having notable success in controlling gun ownership which is apparently benefiting populations of large waterbirds in some areas and may be helping the white-shouldered ibis (4). ,loss;hunting; ,protected; ,2,1
Pava Aliblanca,Penelope albipennis,White-winged guan (Penelope albipennis),Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Galliformes,Cracidae,Penelope (1),Length: 85 cm (2),The initial decline in the white-winged guan was believed to result from overhunting which continues to be a threat today and which may also explain the species\xe2\x80\x99 disappearance from coastal areas. In addition the white-winged guan is under pressure from habitat destruction and fragmentation with forests being cleared for agriculture timber charcoal firewood and artisanal woodcrafts (2) (4) (5) (9) (10). Indeed over 90 percent of the original forest cover of the region may have already been removed (11) and the guan\xe2\x80\x99s decline was exacerbated after land reforms in 1968 allowed greater public access to privately owned land (4) (5). After its rediscovery in 1977 the white-winged guan was believed to number only a few hundred birds at most and is estimated at around 150 to 250 individuals today (2) (4) (5) (7) with around 75 birds held in captivity in 2007 (2). In addition to its small size and restricted range the population is also severely fragmented with only a small number of individuals known from most sites (2) (4).,The white-winged guan has been the subject of a range of conservation efforts since its rediscovery. International trade in the species is banned under its listing on Appendix I of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) (3) and the white-winged guan and its habitat are legally protected within the Laquipampa Wildlife Refuge an area established specifically to protect this species (2) (7) (10). In 1980 a captive breeding programme was set up (4) (12) (13) (14) (15) and the first captive-bred birds were reintroduced to Chaparri Private Conservation Area a community owned and managed reserve in 2001 (2) (9) (14) (16).

These camels continue to be persecuted mainly as they are seen as competition with domestic livestock for the precious water and grazing of the desert (1). Bactrian camels persisted in China even though the Gashun Gobi desert (Lop Nur) was used as a nuclear test site for 45 years (3) today further habitat loss has occurred with the development of a gas pipe-line in the north of the reserve (1) and highly toxic illegal mining (3). Competition with domestic camels and livestock as well as <strong>hybridisation</strong> with domestic camels poses a further threat to the survival of the unique Bactrian camel (1). The total population is predicted to undergo an 80% reduction over the next three generations prompting the species to be listed as Critically Endangered by the World Conservation Union (IUCN) (1).,Areas of the Gobi and Gashun Gobi desert (Lop Nur) where the Bactrian camel remain are protected by the Great Gobi Reserve in Mongolia which was established in 1982 and by the newly established national reserve \xe2\x80\x98Lop Nur Wild Camel Reserve\xe2\x80\x99 in China (1) (7). Both governments have agreed to protect this trans-boundary migrating species in a historic move (3). A captive breeding programme based in Mongolia and run by the Wild Camel Protection Foundation began in 2003 in an effort to safeguard the future of this fascinating animal (3). Recent studies of dromedary (one-humped) camels (<em>Camelus dromedarius</em>) have revealed an extraordinary immune system; camel milk has been found to arrest diabetes in humans and has proved to be a substitute for insulin with these results prompting hopes that further studies of the wild Bactrian camel may yield similarly remarkable discoveries (3) (7). ,loss;pet; ,captive breeding;protected; ,2,2

Plantae,Wollemia nobilis,Wollemi pine (Wollemia nobilis),Plantae,Tracheophyta,Coniferopsida,Coniferales,Araucariaceae,Wollemia (1),Height: 35 m (2),The remaining population of Wollemi pines may represent a relict of the previous extent of this species; it is thought that these trees may have been undergoing a slow natural decline for thousands of years (3). The species is today threatened by the small size and limited range of its population which is intrinsically at risk from any chance event that may occur such as fire or the spread of disease (3).,The Wollemi pine is protected in Australia and the population is located within the Wollemi Pine National Park. A Recovery Plan has been drawn up outlining strategies for the management of this fragile population; the overall objective is to ensure that this species remains viable in the long-term (3). Such a fascinating tree may have much to reveal about ancient species that were previously known only from fossils. Its discovery underlines the vital role that habitat conservation has to play in the preservation of biodiversity (3). ,disease; ,protected; ,1,1

Plagoptere Argente,Plagopterus argentissimus,Woundfin (Plagopterus argentissimus),Animalia,Chordata,Actinopterygii,Cypriniformes,Cyprinidae,Plagopterus (1),Length: up to 10 cm (2),From being the most abundant species in the Virgin River the woundfin has suffered a dramatic population decline (2). Loss and fragmentation of its habitat due to human activities is thought to be a major contributing factor in this decline (1) (4). The damming of the rivers and use of the water for agriculture and mining have also led to changes in the flow regimes of the rivers in the woundfin\xe2\x80\x99s range (2) (4).,A major priority for the conservation of the woundfin is the protection and monitoring of its remaining habitat (4). Research is also being carried out in order to refine captive breeding methods so that this species can be re-introduced back into its historic range. However previous attempts to reintroduce the woundfin have proved unsuccessful (4). ,loss;fragmentation; ,cites;captive breeding; ,2,2
Plantae,Rothmannia annae,Wright's gardenia (Rothmannia annae),Plantae,Tracheophyta,Magnoliopsida,Rubiales,Rubiaceae,Rothmannia (1),Height: up to 6 m (2),Wright's gardenia is restricted to one single population on Aride Island in the Seychelles. Other nearby populations have become extinct for unknown reasons which could also affect the only remaining population. Although the reason for local extinction is unknown it is thought that introduced pests may have been the cause as well as competition with <em>Pisonia grandis</em>. The highly restricted range of Wright\xe2\x80\x99s gardenia makes it particularly vulnerable to extinction (1).,The island of Aride is a Special Reserve (1) and has been the focus of a long-running habitat restoration programme carried out by the Royal Society for Nature Conservation which involves the removal of introduced plants such as coconut palms (3). Almost all non-native trees have been removed and <strong>endemics</strong> such as Wright's gardenia have been planted and are showing encouraging sings of recovery (3). Stands of Wright's gardenia have also been planted on the islands of Fregate and Silhouette; the first wild germination on an island other than Aride for over 100 years has recently occurred on Fregate (3). Careful monitoring and management of these populations are required but the future of this beautiful tree now appears more secure thanks to concerted conservation efforts in the Seychelles. ,pet; , ,1,0

Dabryâs sturgeon,Acipenser dabryanus,Yangtze sturgeon (Acipenser dabryanus),Animalia,Chordata,Actinopterygii,Acipenseriformes,Acipenseridae,Acipenser (1),16 kg (2),The Yangtze sturgeon is at risk from over-fishing pollution and habitat degradation and loss. An important factor in its decline was the construction of the Gezhouba Dam across the Yangtze River at Yichang in Hubei Province in 1981. As this prevented upstream migration necessary for spawning the Yangtze sturgeon is now only found above the dam (2).,Conservation of this fish is now urgent with emphasis needed on habitat protection capture control and stock replenishment. This sturgeon species spawns earlier in life than most sturgeons and therefore has aquaculture potential for caviar production. Controlled production of the Yangtze sturgeon could both reduce fishing levels and allow <strong>reintroductions</strong> of fish back into the river (2). ,loss;fishing;pollution; , ,3,0

Not only is the very limited range of this monkey being reduced due to deforestation but the yellow-breasted capuchin is trapped for the pet trade and hunted for meat (6).,Some protection of this species is achieved as a result of its presence in the Una Biological Reserve the Condur\xc3\xba State Park (2) and at two biological research stations. A survey of this species is being conducted believed to be among the rarest of Neotropical primates (2) but numbers will continue to decline unless the habitat of the yellow-breasted capuchin is protected (6). ,pet; ,protected; ,1,1
Lesser sulphur-crested cockatoo,Cacatua sulphurea,Yellow-crested cockatoo (Cacatua sulphurea),Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Psittaciformes,Psittacidae,Cacatua (1),350 g (2),The main factor responsible for the precipitous decline of all of the races of the yellow-crested cockatoo has been unsustainable over-exploitation for the pet trade. Habitat loss has also played a part in the decline (4).,The yellow-crested cockatoo is now fully protected by Indonesian law and international trade is restricted by CITES. It occurs within a number of protected areas and a species Recovery Plan was initiated in 1998. This programme continues today and is making progress in five key areas namely: controlling trade conserving key habitats removing the market demand for wild birds by establishing captive breeding facilities research into ecology and population dynamics and awareness campaigns (4). ,loss;pet; ,cites;captive breeding;protected; ,2,3
